000-267-571-130-101,"Networks as Channels of Policy Diffusion: Explaining Worldwide Changes in Capital Taxation, 1998–2006",2010-09-06,2010,journal article,International Studies Quarterly,00208833; 14682478,Oxford University Press (OUP),United Kingdom,Xun Cao,"This paper studies policy changes in capital taxation by focusing on policy interdependence induced by network dynamics at the international level. The empirical findings indicate that the competition mechanism induced by network position similarity in the network of portfolio investment and that of exports causes policy diffusion in corporate taxation; the socialization mechanism (policy learning and emulation) induced by network position proximity in the IGO networks also drives policy changes, and the evidence is much stronger in the IGO networks that facilitate policy learning than in those that facilitate emulation. The paper also discusses explicitly empirical challenges to incorporate network characteristics into connectivity matrices in spatial lag models often used to study policy diffusion. It suggests that students of policy diffusion should discuss as explicitly as possible the assumptions and procedures to construct connectivity matrices and present results from alternative specifications: our conclusion on the strength of policy diffusion is often sensitive to the choice of connectivity matrices.",54,3,823,854,Network dynamics; Emulation; Economics; Position (finance); Competition (economics); Socialization (Marxism); Industrial organization; Lag; Portfolio investment; Capital (economics),,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00611.x/abstract https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.wiley-isqu-v-54-i-3-isqu611 http://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/54/3/823/1812997 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/networks-as-channels-of-policy-diffusion-explaining-worldwide-cha https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/54/3/823/1812997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00611.x,,10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00611.x,2102705274,,0,001-770-884-590-920; 002-826-166-575-247; 003-025-422-339-881; 003-193-896-799-954; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-722-686-316-360; 009-218-446-922-560; 010-278-292-671-040; 010-297-483-353-575; 016-857-978-568-376; 018-590-967-575-135; 019-613-487-066-521; 021-764-783-190-682; 022-512-643-506-628; 023-297-486-496-127; 024-813-983-826-750; 025-193-488-999-63X; 027-192-583-848-678; 027-572-769-880-056; 027-812-062-895-342; 027-827-119-143-849; 027-952-834-053-159; 031-467-977-653-894; 031-706-548-871-645; 032-220-205-010-399; 033-085-475-899-252; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-388-056-843-087; 038-196-279-850-666; 038-723-719-475-911; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-373-488-805-853; 060-629-517-891-622; 061-373-791-267-531; 063-134-333-671-865; 063-400-296-712-427; 063-854-160-127-102; 064-336-406-971-626; 065-666-299-776-558; 065-992-235-697-432; 068-465-053-409-57X; 070-411-494-410-398; 072-862-908-678-93X; 075-098-926-871-766; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-846-878-596-830; 081-118-035-104-953; 082-017-566-839-450; 088-993-237-313-315; 090-651-826-892-097; 102-087-916-552-466; 103-527-671-340-555; 111-819-171-804-346; 111-839-995-336-395; 112-251-884-513-781; 115-482-499-323-938; 116-582-648-168-199; 117-544-939-508-615; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 120-686-420-989-186; 122-646-026-449-25X; 125-133-112-392-70X; 125-598-205-116-608; 127-826-672-055-220; 128-402-767-683-008; 131-076-765-815-326; 132-019-020-209-108; 139-186-190-548-754; 141-605-677-048-925; 143-488-781-847-324; 147-275-878-030-579; 148-090-040-712-723; 155-749-563-882-613; 190-032-990-340-879; 195-459-088-993-271; 196-404-637-819-988,98,true,,green
000-377-806-632-331,Diffusing sustainable urban mobility planning in the EU,2020-10-13,2020,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Stefan Werland,"This paper explores how the European Commission promotes the concept of Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning (SUMP) among European cities. Despite the strong uptake of the SUMP concept, mobility-related problems persist in European municipalities. Linking theoretical approaches to understand the diffusion of policies with empirical findings from working with cities in the SUMP context, this article explores channels of policy diffusion and investigates shortcomings related to the respective approaches. Studies on the diffusion, the transfer and the convergence of policies identify formal hierarchy, coercion, competition, learning and networking, and the diffusion of international norms as channels for policy transfer. The findings which are presented in this paper are twofold: First, the paper finds evidence that the Commission takes different roles and uses all mechanisms in parallel, albeit with different intensity. It concludes that the approaches to explain policy diffusion are not competing or mutually exclusive but are applied by the same actor to address different aspects of a policy field, or to reach out to different actors. Second, the article provides first evidence of factors that limit the mechanisms’ abilities to directly influence urban mobility systems and mobility behaviour.",12,20,8436,,Business; Sump; Commission; Coercion; Policy transfer; Context (language use); Competition (economics); Hierarchy; Transportation planning; Economic system,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/20/8436 https://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/index/index/docId/7620 https://epub.wupperinst.org/files/7620/7620_Werland.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v12y2020i20p8436-d427327.html https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/20/8436/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208436,,10.3390/su12208436,3092732546,,0,002-884-188-140-960; 005-363-322-430-148; 006-722-686-316-360; 007-648-938-197-649; 007-758-759-157-059; 008-631-552-749-08X; 009-106-969-240-167; 010-559-515-953-602; 017-839-486-995-934; 025-525-527-725-69X; 027-835-981-532-333; 036-128-538-594-904; 038-615-485-940-543; 047-963-511-113-718; 048-084-385-775-90X; 052-723-818-069-06X; 052-799-257-106-895; 056-020-256-215-559; 058-071-798-060-611; 066-050-117-705-806; 066-313-254-941-364; 072-526-122-037-88X; 072-862-908-678-93X; 075-620-466-978-528; 079-050-676-872-231; 083-721-218-551-907; 085-301-057-452-781; 087-801-782-071-766; 093-190-746-631-057; 097-752-358-703-968; 114-410-567-464-603; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-677-347-760-402; 124-530-191-148-790; 149-135-748-647-149,14,true,cc-by,gold

MARCHIOLO An Analysis of Georgia Schools’ Compliance and Implementation of Federally Mandated School Wellness Policies Under the direction of Michael P. Eriksen, ScD, Director of the Institute of Public Health, Georgia State University Our nation’s youth face health challenges today that are drastically different from the health problems of youth in generations past. The drastic rise in childhood obesity rates prompted the 108th Congress to look for an innovative solution to the problem, mandating that each school district receiving federal funding for Free and Reduced Lunch must create and adopt a local wellness policy. This study examines whether relationships exist between Georgia’s school districts’ wellness policies and specific demographic characteristics of the district. Dependent variables include compliance, phase of implementation, and presence of a school health council. This study conducted univariate analysis using chi square and odds ratio coupled with binary logistic regression. Analysis shows that percent of minority students, as an independent variable, is significantly associated with compliance with the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act.

Katada,"In the past 15 years, the world trading system has experienced a major transformation with the rapid proliferation of free trade agreements (FTAs),1 whereby members make special exemptions to the “most favored nation” principle of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and exchange preferential market access commitments. The increase in FTAs has indeed been phenomenal: from 80 such agreements reported to the WTO or its predecessor organization between 1948 and 1988, to 402 by July 2008 (see Figure 1.1). This FTA boom is all the more remarkable given the many doubts about the intrinsic value of these agreements: the low volumes of trade and investment covered, the red tape of criss-crossing rules of origin (ROOs), the asymmetrical bargaining dynamics that favor industrialized nations over small developing countries, and, in many cases, the low utilization of trade preferences. How then can we explain the rapid expansion of FTAs when their benefits are so much in doubt?",,,1,24,Public economics; Intrinsic value (finance); Business; International economics; Rules of origin; Trade agreement; Market access; Regional integration; Foreign direct investment; Free trade; Developing country,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230234239_1 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230234239_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230234239_1,,10.1057/9780230234239_1,2490063176,,0,,19,false,,

In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stopped recommending many once-promoted interventions as part of a shift from one HIV intervention policy, Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI), to another, High Impact Prevention (HIP). Twenty-nine staff members from 10 organizations were interviewed to explore how organizations reacted to this shift. Three major themes emerged: (1) Personal experience, community assessment, and epidemiological evidence influenced organizations' perceptions of efficacy and preference for earlier interventions. (2) Organizations were concerned that HIP interventions were not a good fit for their priority populations. (3) Organizations were frustrated with the top-down approach by the CDC prioritizing HIP interventions over earlier interventions. These results indicate that organizations continue to see value in and provide DEBI interventions. In addition, a more participatory process incorporating qualitative evidence and organizations' experiences may be necessary to achieve widespread de-implementation of DEBI interventions.",,,15248399221091537,152483992210915,Psychological intervention; Qualitative research; Medicine; Intervention (counseling); Public relations; Nursing; Psychology; Political science; Sociology; Social science,HIP; HIV/AIDS; high-impact prevention; implementation science,,,National Institute of Mental Health; National Institute of Mental Health,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15248399221091537,35533246,10.1177/15248399221091537,,,0,000-145-523-689-087; 000-529-167-103-846; 000-933-248-173-883; 001-253-274-590-207; 009-143-495-835-363; 011-550-391-159-356; 011-676-464-690-492; 016-231-888-879-897; 020-037-734-733-540; 021-048-170-571-303; 021-967-119-843-948; 047-957-291-975-859; 052-490-946-886-799; 056-372-371-185-366; 073-588-163-288-159; 076-703-757-640-711; 086-297-729-997-504; 098-692-033-106-836; 132-283-605-571-762; 160-170-970-473-655; 179-931-741-422-84X,0,false,,

Mooney,"<jats:p>In 1969, political scientist Jack Walker published 'The Diffusion of Innovations among the American States' in the American Political Science Review. 'Walker 1969' has since become a cornerstone of political science, packed with ideas, conjectures, and suggestions that spawned multiple lines of research in multiple fields. In good Kuhnian fashion, Walker 1969 is important less for the answers it provides than for the questions it raises, inspiring generations of political scientists to use the political, institutional, and policy differences among the states to understand policymaking better. Walker 1969 is the rock on which the modern subfield of state politics scholarship was built, in addition to inspiring copious research into federalism, comparative politics, and international relations. This Element documents the deep and extensive impact of Walker 1969 on the study of policymaking in the US states. In the process, it organizes and analyzes that literature, demonstrating its progress and promise.</jats:p>",,,,,Scholarship; Politics; Cornerstone; Comparative politics; State (computer science); Federalism;

First, we consider the policy feedback mechanism, which suggests that policy decisions have spillover effects that influence opinions in other states; residents in the home state then influence the decisions of elected officials. We find that both gubernatorial ACA announcements and grant activity increased support for the ACA in nearby states. Consistent with our expectations, however, only gubernatorial announcements respond to shifts in ACA support, presumably because it is a more salient policy than grant activity. Second, we test for the opinion learning mechanism, which suggests that shifts in public opinion in other states provide a signal to elected officials about the viability of decisions in their own state. We find evidence that states are more likely to emulate other states with similar ACA policy preferences when deciding about when to announce their decisions. Our results suggest that scholars and policy makers should consider how shifts in public support influence the spread of ideas across the American states.",42,2,309,340,Public economics; Public opinion; Actuarial science; Political science; State (polity); Health insurance; Public support; Policy decision; Spillover effect,Affordable Care Act; policy diffusion; public opinion,Humans; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Policy; Politics; Public Opinion; United States,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28007800/ https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/political_science_articles/182/ https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article/42/2/309/13867/The-Role-of-Public-Opinion-Does-It-Influence-the http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28007800 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28007800,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/03616878-3766737,28007800,10.1215/03616878-3766737,2564680664,,0,002-557-636-257-591; 009-992-405-559-665; 010-374-580-211-698; 013-771-847-187-331; 015-591-021-271-179; 016-119-337-387-247; 018-043-095-538-050; 021-827-414-463-927; 023-141-682-812-763; 023-672-511-213-267; 023-843-404-656-218; 026-122-693-419-268; 026-432-771-531-196; 029-350-090-905-391; 033-774-298-508-508; 034-431-213-473-281; 035-810-825-863-850; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 043-547-850-265-638; 044-400-232-408-013; 048-749-265-167-655; 049-065-537-672-348; 052-891-006-819-876; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-274-660-526-403; 059-719-263-014-980; 060-094-797-564-280; 060-472-691-444-518; 061-793-046-506-062; 066-071-612-371-295; 067-020-613-560-975; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-886-965-483-619; 073-799-351-414-175; 076-240-693-922-091; 081-553-265-000-427; 082-812-761-134-782; 084-594-834-967-153; 085-295-492-795-641; 092-884-893-909-848; 094-569-126-108-938; 098-419-626-337-536; 099-560-625-200-764; 102-490-342-063-275; 120-035-158-061-550; 131-900-393-723-959; 138-176-816-462-317; 140-172-488-464-228; 147-231-165-350-738; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-926-847-617-824; 169-706-817-242-13X; 171-088-493-968-28X; 175-448-243-075-122; 181-904-469-222-141,30,false,,

By incorporating different methods, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of how social network and socio-economic attributes contributed to the change of people’s choice on environmental regulatory policy adoption and its implementation. This study uses Pooled OLS model with centrality measures from the network, demographics, and locations to generalize insights to policy diffusion across cities in California, as the core attributes influence population’s the preference on policy adoption. This paper offers insights on environmental policy adoption, and the same methodological approaches can be applied to other policy studies.",,,87,94,Public economics; Social network analysis; Dynamic network analysis; Business; Plastic bag; Policy studies; Protectionism; Population; Centrality; Social network,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20148-7_9 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-20148-7_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20148-7_9,,10.1007/978-3-030-20148-7_9,2954194660,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 021-182-360-397-067; 026-412-549-797-331; 028-373-705-126-470; 033-969-989-312-301; 040-592-961-453-301; 046-374-694-704-69X; 060-454-727-359-667; 073-014-201-416-869; 074-929-503-321-875; 082-572-214-490-577; 086-786-776-616-409; 096-548-920-809-272; 180-523-718-357-78X; 196-404-637-819-988,0,false,,

Boehmke; Richard C. Witmer,"When modeling regional policy diffusion effects, scholars have traditionally made appeals to both social learning and economic competition as causes of diffusion. In their empirical studies of policy adoption, however, they do not attempt to determine which of these two processes are at work. In this article, we argue that these two types of diffusion may have different implications for when a state first adopts a policy and subsequent changes in the extent of that policy and that these effects vary by policy area. In the specific policy area that we study, Indian gaming, we expect social learning diffusion to influence adoption but not expansion; economic competition should influence both policy adoption and policy expansion. Our empirical results confirm these predictions. To study both policy adoption and innovation, we apply models for event counts to state policy data, which allows us to model the extent of policy adoption over time, rather than just the timing of first adoption as is common with eve...",57,1,39,51,Public economics; Empirical research; Policy analysis; Economics; Work (electrical); As is; Policy studies; State (polity); Regional policy; Social learning,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3219833.pdf https://creighton.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/disentangling-diffusion-the-effects-of-social-learning-and-econom http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/106591290405700104 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/106591290405700104 http://prq.sagepub.com/content/57/1/39.abstract https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-621733871/disentangling-diffusion-the-effects-of-social-learning,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/106591290405700104,,10.1177/106591290405700104,2037426346,,0,005-261-328-376-894; 011-420-680-631-412; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-180-195-011-961; 021-511-194-787-899; 025-149-140-623-422; 026-412-549-797-331; 026-821-823-838-739; 030-964-748-185-768; 032-164-929-841-901; 036-961-749-635-681; 048-749-265-167-655; 051-138-259-192-307; 064-309-498-197-08X; 064-753-387-756-134; 065-296-005-360-202; 067-490-686-317-462; 073-753-993-648-180; 073-883-113-579-515; 076-240-693-922-091; 082-912-505-446-777; 084-787-681-556-687; 087-535-931-939-575; 103-349-006-601-699; 115-233-760-377-116; 127-410-453-959-001; 162-242-843-962-117; 163-637-734-144-951; 189-184-142-075-563,254,false,,

This article provides a meta-analysis of 114 studies, demonstrating persisting inconsistencies in the measurement of the mechanisms driving policy diffusion processes. Different indicators are used to measure the same mechanism, and the same indicators are used to measure different mechanisms. To improve this state of affairs, this article puts forward a conceptual structure that serves as a guide for the application of diffusion arguments, a starting point for theoretical refinement and a benchmark to assess measurement validity. In addition to paying more attention to the conceptual consistency of indicators, overcoming the problems currently found in the literature requires the construction of original, innovative research designs instead of the replication of widely used templates.",36,01,87,107,Public economics; Public policy; Economics; Benchmark (surveying); Consistency (negotiation); State of affairs; Measure (data warehouse); International relations; Unit (housing); Management science; Comparative politics,,,,,https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_FF1C06536F2E https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/128098/ http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0143814X1400035X https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-public-policy/article/problems-and-solutions-in-the-measurement-of-policy-diffusion-mechanisms/9C06B9C4D37591FC641694FEC07DE5CF https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/jnlpup/v36y2016i01p87-107_00.html https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0143814X1400035X https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/128098/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0143814x1400035x,,10.1017/s0143814x1400035x,2102180000,,0,000-000-067-586-545; 000-267-571-130-101; 001-328-701-270-077; 002-557-636-257-591; 002-884-188-140-960; 005-091-700-178-597; 005-135-400-747-139; 005-345-962-958-339; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-722-686-316-360; 007-633-856-165-406; 007-758-759-157-059; 009-249-108-095-680; 010-359-122-915-959; 011-224-015-287-916; 011-408-293-945-866; 011-497-790-292-357; 011-957-020-185-592; 012-467-150-825-142; 012-660-104-322-856; 012-883-251-761-670; 014-407-092-366-643; 016-088-247-599-087; 016-096-378-131-513; 017-928-849-887-225; 018-239-036-750-670; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-606-574-430-262; 018-769-346-177-716; 019-183-823-770-095; 021-216-291-636-927; 021-907-061-236-840; 022-699-126-389-630; 023-672-511-213-267; 024-019-758-713-196; 025-112-618-417-304; 025-193-488-999-63X; 025-904-697-812-526; 026-412-549-797-331; 027-835-981-532-333; 028-933-497-480-442; 030-716-612-544-343; 031-248-920-440-257; 031-364-337-057-021; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-090-326-866-779; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-689-436-224-80X; 037-723-307-670-490; 038-242-482-476-045; 038-740-227-454-887; 038-818-459-512-182; 039-541-763-546-413; 041-355-136-696-802; 043-547-850-265-638; 044-045-984-053-178; 045-242-332-974-800; 045-305-507-819-665; 047-812-993-541-791; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-884-171-281-661; 051-563-283-713-00X; 054-290-653-339-595; 054-918-811-453-811; 056-306-816-299-679; 057-183-205-637-981; 058-030-553-407-102; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-275-475-629-425; 058-666-736-821-350; 059-850-774-734-000; 060-883-654-712-022; 061-715-378-994-433; 062-920-494-181-56X; 063-169-717-738-432; 063-400-296-712-427; 065-661-698-376-559; 067-121-006-432-261; 070-725-195-573-965; 071-142-911-222-544; 071-289-035-172-917; 072-862-908-678-93X; 073-484-188-860-557; 074-128-358-343-524; 074-465-905-471-400; 076-202-934-875-795; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-719-089-159-967; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 079-705-757-170-703; 080-285-338-290-10X; 080-355-936-393-177; 081-118-035-104-953; 081-371-742-983-749; 081-452-831-371-706; 081-774-921-119-717; 083-128-427-871-272; 083-721-218-551-907; 084-022-394-011-890; 084-263-522-329-658; 088-993-237-313-315; 091-453-435-388-423; 091-729-566-642-692; 091-963-542-755-516; 092-959-347-033-264; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-833-126-001-305; 096-445-747-696-873; 099-356-907-935-066; 101-460-831-219-265; 103-377-559-100-569; 105-526-785-996-251; 106-779-868-220-194; 109-651-681-475-935; 110-811-723-663-252; 112-333-966-495-520; 114-469-305-545-899; 114-683-525-872-290; 115-586-820-498-299; 115-667-337-333-237; 116-222-257-785-019; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 119-397-843-207-581; 120-521-444-245-979; 121-656-974-147-713; 123-893-910-829-020; 124-765-251-201-351; 126-828-486-581-625; 127-687-277-859-117; 129-470-958-403-882; 129-868-939-005-475; 131-076-765-815-326; 131-103-849-140-822; 131-249-950-556-656; 133-069-751-461-616; 136-960-539-858-124; 138-257-828-299-646; 139-153-398-330-745; 139-186-190-548-754; 141-110-584-180-455; 143-203-574-164-326; 144-535-143-036-901; 145-047-319-889-865; 146-213-796-969-064; 149-601-821-920-013; 151-957-596-917-668; 155-580-858-393-517; 156-586-921-097-184; 172-070-974-127-247; 172-115-983-943-664; 173-256-407-940-663; 179-155-628-014-669; 180-373-229-924-527; 188-693-529-211-039; 197-895-530-459-447,137,false,,

We adopt Everett Rogers’ (1983, 2004) attribute typology from the diffusion of innovations literature and apply it to a sample of 27 policy innovations from the sphere of criminal justice policy in the U.S. states between 1973 and 2002. We find that policy attributes, ranging from the relative advantage of the policy over its predecessors to its complexity to its compatibility with past practices, affect the likelihood of adoption. Furthermore, policy attributes shape the extent to which spatial adoption patterns and learning mechanisms are relevant to the policy’s diffusion.",73,01,108,124,Public economics; Policy analysis; Economics; Diffusion of innovations; Criminal justice policy; Sociological theory of diffusion; Typology,,,,,http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1017/S0022381610000903 https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1017/S0022381610000903 http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022381610000903,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022381610000903,,10.1017/s0022381610000903,1991640013,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 003-592-471-884-916; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-692-270-875-15X; 008-359-079-785-535; 012-286-853-432-764; 019-310-767-716-316; 019-456-406-334-322; 033-969-989-312-301; 034-823-500-420-716; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 037-702-780-317-243; 049-660-819-007-414; 050-082-471-457-812; 053-881-899-918-552; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 064-753-387-756-134; 064-908-659-474-004; 065-296-005-360-202; 067-490-686-317-462; 072-593-731-120-128; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 084-787-681-556-687; 098-419-626-337-536; 100-580-372-997-18X; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-571-654-506-512; 102-169-007-053-650; 102-490-342-063-275; 106-352-974-752-749; 115-631-793-638-558; 122-333-328-830-796; 127-807-528-981-832; 128-626-892-490-398; 131-900-393-723-959; 137-674-676-505-121; 145-463-093-374-983; 146-223-889-641-374; 151-816-975-549-712; 153-741-318-378-043; 154-228-278-302-026; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-637-734-144-951; 173-256-407-940-663; 178-999-536-301-066; 180-187-712-085-074; 198-709-382-077-715,176,false,,

In line with the recent spatial turn in comparative public policy studies, this paper examines with regard to three welfare state programmes whether, in the postwar period, the provision of social rights in 18 Western democracies was shaped by benefit generosity in other countries. We show that diffusion is present but varies by programme and over time.

J. Nykiforuk; Elizabeth J. Campbell; Soultana Macridis; Daniel W. McKennitt; Kayla Atkey; Kim D. Raine,"Healthy public policy is an important tool for creating environments that support human health and wellbeing. At the local level, municipal policies, such as zoning bylaws, provide an opportunity for governments to regulate building location and the type of services offered. Across North America, there has been a recent proliferation of municipal bylaws banning fast food drive-through services. Research on the utilization of this policy strategy, including bylaw adopters and adopter characteristics, is limited within the Canadian context. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize Canadian municipalities based on level of policy innovation and nature of their adopted bylaw banning fast food drive-through services. A multiple case history methodology was utilized to identify and analyse eligible municipal bylaws, and included development of a chronological timeline and map of adopter municipalities within Canada. Grey literature and policy databases were searched for potential adopters of municipal fast food drive-through service bylaws. Adopters were confirmed through evidence of current municipal bylaws. Geographic diffusion and diffusion of innovations theories provided a contextual framework for analysis of bylaw documents. Analysis included assignment of adopter-types, extent and purpose of bans, and policy learning activities of each adopter municipality. From 2002 to 2016, 27 municipalities were identified as adopters: six innovators and twenty-one early adopters. Mapping revealed parallel geographic diffusion patterns in western and eastern Canada. Twenty-two municipalities adopted a partial ban and five adopted a full ban. Rationales for the drive-through bans included health promotion, environmental concerns from idling, community character and aesthetics, traffic concerns, and walkability. Policy learning, including research and consultation with other municipalities, was performed by nine early adopters. This study detailed the adoption of fast food drive-through bylaws across Canada.

002-258-339-833-943,A Policy Diffusion Model of E-Government Implementation Across Nations,,2014,,,,,,Christopher B. Williams; J Girish,"Effective e-government creates an environment for citizens to have greater access to their government and, in theory, makes citizen-to-government contact more inclusive. Our research examines two distinct but related measures of e-government effectiveness, namely the online service index and the eparticipation index, both reported in the 2010 e-government survey conducted by the United Nations. We analyze the impact of political structure, public sector performance and policy initiatives on both indices in more than 150 countries. Our multiple regression analysis shows that there is greater e-government capability in countries that have more effective public sector governance and administration, and policies that advance the development and diffusion of information and communication technologies. More democratic institutions and processes, however, appear to have a negative impact on e-government. In addition, countries that practice effective governance and promote competition in the telecommunications sector demonstrate more extensive provision of e-participation. These results suggest that the path to egovernment leverages different strategies depending on a nation’s political structure, and that authoritarian countries may be utilizing e-government to maintain the status quo. Highlights Countries that have more effective public sector governance and administration offer a higher level of online government services and opportunities for e-participation. Countries that have an independent national regulatory authority for telecommunications have more of an online services presence. Countries that devote more financial resources to develop and promote ICTs provide more online services. Countries that have more open competition in their telecommunication industries provide more online services and opportunities for e-participation. Online government information and services are more extensive in less democratic countries than in more democratic countries.",,,,,Public economics; Public sector; Government; Political science; Status quo; Political structure; Service (business); Competition (economics); Corporate governance; Democracy,,,,,,,,,2186053904,,0,000-021-430-774-210; 002-365-933-353-591; 003-289-433-840-865; 006-840-325-697-441; 008-751-902-639-128; 008-810-394-783-410; 011-007-642-015-097; 012-466-915-625-915; 012-832-414-748-113; 016-055-306-535-577; 017-232-891-349-53X; 023-078-325-907-116; 033-483-120-758-307; 034-420-165-656-302; 036-251-863-708-315; 036-326-899-413-096; 036-672-980-425-408; 038-382-447-348-915; 039-648-014-566-441; 039-824-854-017-314; 039-895-562-627-696; 045-409-921-568-722; 045-781-955-624-981; 046-944-121-495-028; 048-083-628-271-550; 048-579-239-406-377; 049-006-152-086-970; 050-792-909-240-711; 051-601-133-228-097; 052-257-042-380-524; 053-160-409-871-772; 056-077-059-538-567; 059-605-368-001-523; 061-053-514-486-389; 061-281-904-100-335; 062-657-740-597-005; 063-149-938-949-77X; 063-670-758-835-748; 075-810-114-252-915; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-620-341-761-507; 081-270-102-781-281; 085-370-015-235-868; 085-890-918-095-869; 086-133-081-824-406; 086-605-571-154-030; 086-717-863-272-633; 086-817-413-957-879; 090-636-221-923-414; 090-851-705-915-260; 091-220-428-313-987; 093-650-551-450-381; 101-254-254-506-522; 121-362-074-121-864; 122-471-849-803-764; 132-861-720-144-821; 142-108-488-120-966; 145-479-975-513-988; 149-296-024-820-716; 155-835-138-088-655; 159-321-746-144-443; 167-893-212-841-862; 189-693-726-873-396,0,false,,

Second, the article demonstrates that development bank aid helped to spur earlier legislative action. Third, the results demonstrate that developed countries acted earlier than developing countries. And finally, the onset and severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic was a significant influence on the legislative response. Multilateral organizations have a positive influence in global policy diffusion through informational advocacy, technical assistance, and financial aid.

The first has mainly focused on e-government, drawing on the theory of innovation diffusion as a general framework, while the second has mainly applied the administrative policy diffusion framework to the specific case of American states. Inspired by institutional theory, this second framework has not been applied to the case of European local governments. Furthermore, each framework has been mobilized by studies examining separately one of the two levels of e-government diffusion: website implementation or website services development. The aim of our paper is to examine if technological and administrative policy innovation factors impact the level of e-government development by municipalities. For that purpose, the paper collected data from a sample of 5,108 municipalities located in the French Grand Est region. ; 	JEL Codes: H70, M10",31,1,195,219,Business; Institutional theory; Regional science; Government; E-Government; Work (electrical); Innovation diffusion; Sample (statistics),,,,,https://hal.univ-lorraine.fr/hal-02536413 https://www.cairn-int.info/journal-of-innovation-economics-2020-1-page-195.htm https://www.cairn.info/revue-journal-of-innovation-economics-2020-1-page-195.htm https://ideas.repec.org/a/cai/jiedbu/jie_pr1_0061.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3917/jie.pr1.0061,,10.3917/jie.pr1.0061,3002589117,,0,003-592-471-884-916; 021-820-432-690-769; 027-288-774-275-290; 027-827-119-143-849; 030-825-793-592-274; 036-961-749-635-681; 044-014-820-118-586; 051-601-133-228-097; 053-065-134-559-062; 056-077-059-538-567; 059-373-822-156-93X; 065-766-237-659-522; 067-490-686-317-462; 074-443-939-308-890; 089-684-279-518-076; 091-354-594-482-149; 093-650-551-450-381; 110-835-010-775-63X; 115-482-499-323-938; 123-160-490-094-946; 124-434-403-484-922; 130-780-004-700-498; 150-625-963-390-603; 164-858-523-891-24X,4,true,,green

Both models contend that decision making occurs laterally as state officials learn from or react to the policy decisions of other elites; the public has a minor role. I offer an additional explanation, the social contagion model, which suggests that state residents react to neighboring policies by changing their aggregate opinions on that policy. If state opinion becomes supportive, state officials respond by enacting similar policies in the home state or risk being ousted from office. Using both individual and aggregate data on antismoking legislation, I find empirical support for the social contagion model.

I rely on a multi-methods strategy to analyze my proposition in the context of the limited diffusion of certain anti-smoking policies around the world. First, the statistical analysis of novel, monthly-data for a sample of 95 countries from 1973 to 2016 reveals that anti-smoking policies challenged by international lawsuits diffused at slower speeds relative to comparable undisputed policies, while cases were ongoing. Second, primary and secondary qualitative sources and in-depth interviews demonstrate that scarce information around these lawsuits induced both sued and third governments to delay the adoption of the challenged policies. Specifically, I show that governments inexperienced with international arbitration decided to wait for more information on the cases before deciding whether to adopt the disputed regulations. After information was revealed, developed countries; estimated they could bear the risk of a potential costly lawsuit and promptly adopted the disputed policies, while developing countries did not. My findings indicate that MNCs can use Investor-State disputes to place countries in a world of scarce information, and hence affect their sovereign powers by slowing down their policy-making; processes.Governmen",,,,,Diffusion (business); Economics; International economics; State (polity); Chilling effect; Global policy; Affect (psychology),,,,,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/63761,http://dx.doi.org/10.15781/t2n29pq0r,,10.15781/t2n29pq0r,2788718588,,0,,0,false,,
002-817-703-684-672,The Global Diffusion of Regulatory Instruments: The Making of a New International Environmental Regime,2004-12-20,2004,,,,,,Per-Olof Busch; Helge Jörgens; Kerstin Tews,"DeutschWahrend der 1990er hat sich ein neues Regulierungsmuster in der nationalen Umweltpolitik entwickelt, das durch eine gestiegene Anwendung kooperativer, informations- und marktbezogener Instrumente charakterisiert ist. Dieses Muster ist zu einem bedeutenden Teil ein Ergebnis internationaler Politikdurchdringung � die landerubergreifende Verbreitung von Politikinnovationen, angetrieben durch Informationsflusse vielmehr als hierarchische oder kollektive Entscheidungsprozesse innerhalb internationaler Institutionen. Auf der Basis von vier Fallstudien legt das Papier empirisch dar, wie horizontale Durchdringungsprozesse, begleitet von Information und Empfehlungen internationaler Organisationen, in einer steigenden Anzahl von Staaten zur Annahme neuer Regulierungsinstrumente gefuhrt haben und wie diese individuellen nationalen Umsetzungen zusammen eine aufkommende Regulierungsstruktur auf internationaler Ebene ergeben. Auf der Makro-Ebene untersuchen die Fallstudien, wie die Durchdringung mit den beiden anderen internationalen Hauptmechanismen nationalen Politikwandels zusammenwirkt: Legale Harmonisierung und zwangsweise Auferlegung. Insbesondere innerhalb der Europaischen Union kann ein typisches Muster horizontaler Durchdringung zwischen individuellen Mitgliedstaaten, gefolgt von vertikaler Durchdringung von der nationalen auf die europaische Ebene und letztendlich zu einer EU-weiten legalen Harmonisierung durch EG-Richtlinien, identifiziert werden. Auf der Mikro-Ebene erforscht das Papier, welche Faktoren die Durchdringung neuer umweltpolitischer Instrumente begunstigen oder behindern. Wahrend die Bekraftigung von Regulierungsinstrumenten durch internationale Organisationen oder transnationale Netzwerke von Befurwortern oft ihre Durchdringung erleichtert, bestimmen die Charakteristika der Instrumente das Ausmas und die Geschwindigkeit, mit der Regulierungsinstrumente sich uber Lander ausbreiten. Was die Motivation von politischen Entscheidungstragern fur die freiwillige Anwendung von Regulierungsinstrumenten betrifft, argumentiert das Papier, dass dies nicht ausschlieslich durch rationale Versuche, die Effektivitat von Politiken zu verbessern, erklart werden kann. Daruber hinaus ist die Ubernahme von Politik sehr oft durch Anliegen der Legitimitat und wahrgenommenen Druck, mit internationalen Normen zu entsprechen, motiviert. EnglishDuring the 1990s a new regulatory pattern in domestic environmental policymaking has been emerging which is characterized by an increasing use of cooperative, informational and markedbased instruments. This pattern is to an important extent a result of international policy diffusion � the cross-national spread of policy innovations driven by information flows rather than hierarchical or collective decision-making within international institutions. Based on four case studies, the paper demonstrates empirically how horizontal diffusion processes accompanied by information and recommendations from international organizations have led to the adoption of new regulatory instruments in an increasing number of countries and how these individual national adoptions add up to an emerging regulatory structure at the international level. At the macro-level, the case studies explore how diffusion interacts with the other two major international mechanisms of domestic policy change: legal harmonization and coercive imposition. Especially within the European Union a typical pattern of horizontal diffusion between individual member states, followed by vertical diffusion from the national to the EU-level and finally leading to an EU-wide legal harmonization through EC-directives can be identified. At the micro-level, the paper investigates which factors promote or obstruct the diffusion of new environmental policy instruments. While the endorsement of regulatory instruments by international organizations or transnational advocacy networks often facilitates their diffusion, the instruments' characteristics determine the extent and speed by which regulatory instruments spread across countries. As regards policymakers' motivation for voluntarily adopting regulatory instruments, the paper argues that it cannot be exclusively explained by rational attempts to improve policy effectiveness. In addition, policy adoption is often motivated by concerns of legitimacy and perceived pressure to conform with international norms",8,8,21,,Political science; Multi-level governance; Regulatory competition; Making-of; Environmental policy; Economic growth; Welfare economics,,,,,https://ciencia.iscte-iul.pt/id/ci-pub-29868 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3709390 https://ideas.repec.org/a/erp/eiopxx/p0126.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:erp:eiopxx:p0126,https://ciencia.iscte-iul.pt/id/ci-pub-29868,,,1515630354,,0,,2,false,,

This article develops a theoretical framework that accounts for the multidirectional features of diffusion, including sub-national, cross-national, and international mechanisms, through the illustrative case of Brazil’s federal adoption of Bolsa Escola (School Grant Program), a conditional cash transfer program that preceded the internationally acclaimed poverty alleviation program called Bolsa Familia (Family Grant Program). Using process tracing, I argue that bottom-up pressures, including professional norms and intergovernmental competition, were key for policy emulation. Cross-national competition had little effect on decision-making. Finally, top-down processes, including norms and financing, reinforced adoption decisions and ensured these programs would endure.",42,1,25,51,Public economics; Top-down and bottom-up design; Emulation; Economics; Poverty; Process tracing; Conditional cash transfer; Competition (economics); Professional norms; Public administration,,,,,http://academic.oup.com/publius/article-abstract/42/1/25/1921644 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3845996 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:oup:publus:v:42:y:2012:i:1:p:25-51 https://academic.oup.com/publius/article-abstract/42/1/25/1921644 https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/publus/v42y2012i1p25-51.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/publius/pjr019,,10.1093/publius/pjr019,1988830278,,0,003-696-864-822-587; 005-249-461-623-469; 009-941-033-118-497; 011-576-380-916-644; 013-408-770-741-050; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-575-340-074-426; 020-436-975-493-830; 025-181-791-281-227; 025-186-004-983-717; 028-407-052-046-096; 033-041-370-562-368; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-318-000-420-191; 043-773-437-159-618; 044-045-984-053-178; 044-958-408-877-837; 044-972-900-006-161; 047-812-993-541-791; 048-528-031-050-826; 050-082-471-457-812; 052-723-818-069-06X; 057-526-816-222-402; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-569-703-645-405; 063-149-938-949-77X; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-067-510-293-836; 073-796-412-498-509; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-615-528-480-378; 077-926-704-396-107; 078-081-075-678-13X; 081-036-171-196-873; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-787-681-556-687; 085-093-538-736-669; 086-254-802-036-25X; 088-993-237-313-315; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-833-126-001-305; 101-127-387-013-017; 105-526-785-996-251; 107-559-043-559-89X; 112-825-637-103-240; 113-259-812-031-647; 119-939-838-309-616; 121-466-850-128-820; 121-916-230-399-721; 125-175-227-024-988; 128-150-266-973-359; 129-868-939-005-475; 132-314-232-662-897; 133-087-716-464-773; 136-815-442-429-728; 144-789-737-586-53X; 145-897-753-805-768; 150-098-284-993-531; 157-629-506-727-488; 164-055-518-540-665; 178-627-938-556-726; 178-927-906-303-374,39,false,,

The analysis is organized around three fundamental questions. First, why does policy diffusion occur? Answering this question will require scholars to devote more attention to concepts such as imitation, emulation, and competition. Second, which political forces facilitate or impede policy diffusion? Answering this question will require scholars to devote more attention to the causal mechanisms at work when states adopt policies like those of other states. Third, what is being diffused? Answering this question will require scholars to think more carefully about the content of public policy, both as an outcome to be explained and as a factor that itself affects the diffusion process.",7,1,54,80,Public policy; Positive economics; Imitation; Outcome (game theory); Emulation; Work (electrical); Political science; Scholarship; Competition (economics); Management science; Politics,,,,,https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/emerging-issues-and-future-directions-in-state-policy-diffusion-r http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/153244000700700104 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/abs/emerging-issues-and-future-directions-in-state-policy-diffusion-research/462B14999315DE74DC79FBD8D5D61689 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/153244000700700104,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/153244000700700104,,10.1177/153244000700700104,2331302690,,0,000-803-694-602-443; 001-328-701-270-077; 001-871-757-369-265; 003-542-105-072-533; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-503-339-286-965; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-282-272-395-98X; 008-359-079-785-535; 008-414-059-072-131; 008-653-694-174-709; 010-118-914-495-318; 012-883-251-761-670; 013-709-264-087-454; 013-739-423-912-464; 013-753-441-575-394; 014-694-012-786-985; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-342-712-111-205; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-180-195-011-961; 021-419-031-338-034; 021-820-432-690-769; 022-405-535-947-107; 026-223-762-254-480; 027-128-952-167-530; 027-951-241-530-090; 030-038-250-183-818; 031-120-988-574-347; 032-094-816-030-255; 032-164-929-841-901; 034-017-071-222-511; 034-576-609-343-931; 036-958-364-114-204; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-477-778-556-546; 041-913-845-077-530; 043-418-719-602-52X; 044-045-984-053-178; 044-958-408-877-837; 045-553-054-284-68X; 047-812-993-541-791; 049-084-800-183-79X; 049-561-974-880-973; 050-274-654-059-514; 052-252-031-072-654; 053-697-549-206-862; 057-484-490-124-93X; 057-621-004-140-001; 059-985-565-107-13X; 061-024-976-652-254; 061-602-896-004-937; 063-467-464-997-422; 064-753-387-756-134; 066-196-175-938-562; 066-907-133-574-367; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-246-795-278-536; 070-262-284-049-550; 070-439-295-045-214; 072-830-196-099-537; 073-753-993-648-180; 075-046-752-556-824; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-282-492-189-546; 077-292-312-519-129; 078-086-437-467-958; 078-544-962-568-939; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-787-681-556-687; 085-466-333-938-784; 085-835-075-480-379; 086-148-759-903-581; 086-786-776-616-409; 087-422-766-447-866; 087-535-931-939-575; 088-062-843-972-331; 088-280-311-739-489; 091-394-237-745-859; 091-736-584-918-934; 092-203-049-604-110; 092-858-750-165-82X; 093-190-746-631-057; 095-421-061-786-644; 095-577-177-071-676; 098-317-151-036-205; 101-127-387-013-017; 106-352-974-752-749; 120-605-048-386-567; 121-133-996-131-146; 127-586-029-676-511; 128-150-266-973-359; 134-300-624-191-268; 141-402-405-160-411; 142-654-492-516-830; 145-260-087-070-588; 146-868-552-740-180; 148-460-439-813-652; 149-407-118-840-717; 151-036-505-294-631; 154-228-278-302-026; 154-314-204-508-516; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-076-040-775-567; 163-637-734-144-951; 173-256-407-940-663; 175-297-392-061-124; 181-527-602-104-961; 184-097-701-119-060; 187-151-090-396-571,189,false,,

Menifield; LaShonda M. Stewart,"ABSTRACTThis article applied the policy diffusion model as a theoretical framework for interpreting the international spread of performance-based budgeting, based upon 33 OECD case studies of countries that have implemented this reform. The data show that the historical development of performance-based budgeting was fairly consistent with the diffusion model. In particular, the adoption of performance budgeting took off during 1985–1995 and then accelerated over the following 15 years, and the primary innovators were a group of four English-speaking countries with comparatively laissez-faire economies (the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand). The case studies indicated that performance-based budgeting was generally part of a broader program of governmental reform, that executive agencies were more important than parliaments in managing it, that it became quite important in budget- and policy-making, and that implementing it faced a significant number of challenges.",41,7,528,534,Public economics; Accounting; Economics,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01900692.2016.1278384,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01900692.2016.1278384,,10.1080/01900692.2016.1278384,2589089374,,0,000-231-438-336-843; 003-031-966-394-310; 006-722-686-316-360; 017-050-620-235-410; 023-672-511-213-267; 026-288-082-362-784; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-818-459-512-182; 040-207-562-706-339; 049-362-167-379-785; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-304-145-651-653; 050-338-961-105-322; 055-379-011-394-469; 055-918-635-572-497; 056-077-059-538-567; 056-119-472-948-116; 057-454-588-143-584; 058-071-798-060-611; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-494-922-804-102; 073-339-919-030-397; 073-564-768-109-225; 081-767-160-491-761; 087-197-986-264-852; 089-174-767-784-218; 090-851-705-915-260; 093-190-746-631-057; 093-213-959-026-976; 098-795-275-508-362; 101-488-954-100-242; 107-470-293-960-917; 114-297-985-479-03X; 123-214-076-646-486; 131-076-765-815-326; 138-230-329-011-61X; 153-493-918-742-929; 153-605-019-695-229; 165-182-659-081-675; 169-776-287-791-150; 177-157-446-159-900; 178-540-540-559-685,8,false,,

According to our theoretical priors we expect that parties respond to globalization in a different way depending on their ideology and social groups of representation. The empirical analysis is based on a panel model of 34 political parties in 17 Western European countries between 1970 and 2010. We find that right-wing parties move leftward in response to globalization while left-wing parties do not alter their position, or move rightward. Additionally, we find that parties ideological positions are affected by foreign parties’ positions of the same ideological bloc giving support to party policy diffusion argument. The main findings appear remarkably robust to additional econometric techniques such as instrumental variables, Jackknife and methods that account for cross-sectional dependence. The findings in total give support for the existence of party system convergence towards left due to the right-wing party moderation.",,,,,Political economy; Ideology; Political science; Social group; Position (finance); Globalization; Representation (politics); Argument; Moderation; Politics,,,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/83796/,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/83796/,,,2782890522,,0,,0,false,,

Diallo; Calvin W. L. Ho,"This paper considers how ethical norms on sharing of human biological materials and related data in international policy documents diffuse from global forums to national policies and practices. With focus on the domestic policies of four countries (i.e. Guinea, Argentina, India and Malawi), this paper seeks to explain policy diffusion by broadly applying an analytical framework wherein policy learning is one of four theories used to explain how countries learn policy norms from expert epistemic communities and international organizations. While the governance structures of all four countries broadly incorporate key ethical provisions in international policy documents on sharing of biological materials and related data for biomedical research, relative emphasis on certain provisions differ among them. In three of these countries (i.e. Guinea, Argentina and India), international ethical norms have had direct influence over their domestic governance policies. Their impact has been greatest for Guinea and Argentina, whose governance policies had to be adapted in response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa and the Zika virus epidemic in Latin America. In both countries, sharing of biological materials and related data with international organisations increased significantly to meet therapeutic and research needs during the outbreaks. International organisations have had a comparatively greater role in bringing about policy change in Guinea when compared with Argentina, mainly due to the fragility of the health system in Guinea in 2014. In contrast, policy in India and in Malawi occurred under less strenuous conditions. This may account for the relatively greater emphasis on control and limits to cross-border transferability in their policies when compared with those of Guinea and Argentina. While all four countries have made significant progress in establishing accountable governance arrangements, still more needs to be done to ensure that the ethical goal of equitable sharing of benefits is realised.",4,,170,,Latin Americans; Political science; Control (management); Policy learning; Biological materials; International policy; West africa; Research needs; Corporate governance; Economic growth,,,,Medical Research Council; National Institutes of Health; Wellcome Trust; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-170/v1/xml https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-170,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15480.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15480.1,2984800504,,0,,6,true,cc-by,gold

This explorative analysis investigates in which international forums on energy Post-Communist countries participate and what motivates their participation. Theoretically, the article draws from theories of policy diffusion to explain why the Post-Communist countries have joined the 11 international forums on climate governance selected. It contends that the wish to follow the example of high-status countries or organizations, considerations concerning economic competitiveness, and the wish to obtain access to knowledge are potential factors explaining membership. Empirically, the article uses explorative methods to probe the plausibility of the three hypotheses. The database comprises information on the participation of 28 Post-Communist countries in 11 pertinent international forums, which are all characterized by a low degree of formalization and voluntary cooperation. Our findings show that neither the European Union nor Russia as a high-status organization or country had a robust impact on the Post-Communist countries’ decision to join the international forums on energy of interest. Instead, our indicative and preliminary findings suggest that access to knowledge was the most relevant driver of participation.",,,,,Political science; Climate governance; European union; Post communist; Public relations; Energy (esotericism),,,,,https://heidata.uni-heidelberg.de/citation?persistentId=doi:10.11588/data/3KTIBI,http://dx.doi.org/10.11588/data/3ktibi,,10.11588/data/3ktibi,3207986867,,0,,0,false,,

In doing so, we critique the core belief that underpins it, namely, the notion that housing problems are the product of universal structural conditions that are common to all societies. In turn, we also critique the logical derivative, namely, the notion that housing policies which have been ‘successful’ in their country of origin can be transferred to (that is, exported to or imported by) other societies. To do this, we commence by developing a conceptual framework that is based on the idea of societal ‘divergence’ rather than universalism. This provides a comparative method which we then apply in order to examine the second-home ownership problematic in Britain and Sweden. In doing so, they demonstrate that the problems caused by postwar growth in second-home ownership (and the associated housing policy responses that have been formulated) are particular to each country.

We present a comparative political economy of these welfare reforms, one that draws on both the policy transfer and policy diffusion literatures. By the 1980s, both parties faced three problems related to national economic decline, the ideological challenge to Keynesianism, and the decline of the traditional working-class electorate.

This dynamic puts federal Executive branch in the center of the integration process, therefore arising questions about representation and legitimacy in the study of regional institution. Based on the concept of policy diffusion phenomena, this paper discusses the search for legitimacy through mimicry: it tests the hypothesis that plural exchanges between Mercosur and the EU yield internal rules importing European model, and stimulate technical cooperation spreading institutional practices. The institutional design influenced by a more ancient and consolidated institution can be exploited as a source of legitimacy, fostered by employees of Mercosur and epistemic communities. However, these regional standards are assimilated differently by the member states, thus, in a second moment, the work confronts the results of the analysis of institutional diffusion within with data on the effective internalization of these rules, as means to scrutinize how the regional search for legitimacy relates to the effectiveness of domestic rules. The result of the empirical analysis shows that there is a path of political transfer between the European Union and Mercosur working by: (i) internal rules which directly imports the European model; (ii) technical cooperation diffusing institutional practices; (iii) nornative harmonization as a way to favor future interactions.",37,2,537,570,Economy; Economics; Work (electrical); Plural; Harmonization; Institution; European union; Legitimacy; Yield (finance); Economic system; Politics,,,,,http://www.scielo.br/j/cint/a/kY6xV6Z9nbzgKPgBGtCfrLw/ https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-85292015000200537&lng=pt&tlng=en http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-85292015000200537 https://biblat.unam.mx/es/revista/contexto-internacional/articulo/processos-de-difusao-politica-e-legitimidade-no-mercosul-mimetismo-institucional-e-mecanismos-de-internalizacao-de-normas-comunitarias http://www.scielo.br/pdf/cint/v37n2/0102-8529-cint-37-02-00537.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s0102-85292015000200007,,10.1590/s0102-85292015000200007,2462470358,,0,004-177-572-459-693; 012-835-822-224-806; 022-512-643-506-628; 025-567-709-795-176; 027-827-119-143-849; 039-318-000-420-191; 040-309-416-352-429; 056-698-194-815-75X; 058-071-798-060-611; 063-029-058-470-158; 079-181-938-254-100; 087-663-486-169-272; 099-632-707-150-545; 115-482-499-323-938; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-038-309-870-26X; 125-456-287-172-449; 147-343-460-120-288; 196-277-131-664-350; 196-954-048-210-361,2,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Ingraham,"What is the rationale for the adoption, diffusion, and implementation ofpay-for-performance programs in the public sector? Patricia Ingraham questions the basisfor the common view that private sector experience with pay-for-performance has been successful. She explores the additionalproblems posed by public management and compensation systems. An examination of implementation ofpay-for-performance in the United States and in other OECD nations demonstrates gaps between expectations and realities in public settings. Despite obvious problems, the effort continues to appeal to both elected officials and many public managers. More careful attention to design, resource commitment, and evaluation in public organizations is recommended. During the past 30 years, performance appraisal and pay-for-performance systems have become widespread in the United States. Over 90 percent of private sector firms operate with some form of pay-for-performance (Wyatt Company, 1989). The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created pay-for-performance systems for members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) and for midlevel managers in the federal government. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 established a joint labor-management committee to investigate the possibility of extending the systems government-wide. Over 20 states currently have pay-for-performance systems on the books, and several more are considering adoption in the near future (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1990). Many counties and cities also have such systems, although data are limited on these schemes (Ammons and Rodriguez, 1986). The diffusion has also been cross-national; 13 member nations of the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) now have some form of pay-forperformance (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1992).1",53,4,348,,Private sector; Business; Public sector; Government; Pay for performance; Reform Act; Performance appraisal; Appeal; Service (business); Public administration,,,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/977147?origin=crossref,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/977147,,10.2307/977147,2319060563,,0,026-816-205-295-697; 036-961-749-635-681; 043-492-454-002-144; 047-900-280-427-42X; 049-720-453-562-799; 061-952-871-951-065; 062-436-783-331-806; 083-099-894-950-017; 104-557-517-981-737; 115-813-732-346-663; 130-378-320-428-152; 143-347-718-477-886; 152-319-485-225-749; 162-905-161-605-002; 192-570-524-061-128,185,false,,

In current debates on explaining reform in ‘Bismarckian’ social (health) insurance systems, however, these issues have been neglected. In particular, the role of ‘negative lesson-drawing’ in the sense of avoiding mistakes of others has not often been considered. This article compares health system change in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, three countries with health systems of the social insurance type. In contrast to the existing literature, our analysis stresses that these countries have taken different reform paths since the 1990s. By applying a most similar systems design, we analyze how far cross-border lesson-drawing has contributed to health system divergence in the three countries. The empirical basis of the analysis is semi-structured qualitative expert interviews, a method appropriate for tracing processes of lesson-drawing. We argue that in order to fully understand the diverging reform trajectories, we need to take into account how political decision-makers refer to (negative) experiences of other countries. Generally, national driving forces for health system change were at the heart of many crucial reforms during the period studied. Nevertheless, we claim that it was the German bad practice role model that kept the reform paths of Austria and Germany apart in the Austrian health reform discussion between 2000 and 2005.",49,1,88,108,Public economics; Comparative research; Sociology; German; Health care; Social policy; Policy transfer; Social insurance; Economic growth; Role model; Social determinants of health,,,,Hans Bï¿½ckler Foundation,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spol.12078 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spol.12078/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/spol.12078,,10.1111/spol.12078,2038645891,,0,000-272-652-679-223; 000-848-903-800-593; 001-284-317-140-786; 001-703-469-669-543; 005-906-992-301-159; 006-734-956-591-441; 011-593-439-407-145; 012-356-427-202-019; 014-413-845-809-834; 014-500-777-314-076; 015-279-154-076-936; 017-563-070-617-759; 019-981-235-306-188; 021-599-119-173-87X; 022-391-097-415-797; 022-522-653-003-345; 025-112-618-417-304; 036-646-656-196-771; 042-583-625-945-348; 043-527-868-233-249; 049-368-478-844-995; 049-471-483-046-782; 050-274-654-059-514; 055-421-954-326-011; 062-111-363-216-603; 065-405-948-890-233; 070-061-422-626-571; 070-802-780-344-22X; 072-862-908-678-93X; 073-907-101-210-976; 078-766-778-950-39X; 078-813-440-514-450; 080-516-778-595-068; 084-351-637-978-949; 090-851-705-915-260; 090-961-477-017-430; 092-798-917-703-895; 102-124-223-813-707; 103-426-191-397-488; 105-359-331-315-161; 110-989-377-957-079; 115-667-337-333-237; 116-025-585-124-970; 116-829-119-249-075; 117-677-347-760-402; 124-630-781-831-387; 124-724-414-568-035; 125-268-617-755-543; 133-775-028-145-663; 163-637-734-144-951; 185-027-026-910-213,10,false,,

Absent from this research is a thorough discussion of the content of the information state governments use when deciding whether or not to adopt an innovative policy. Given the importance of information in decision making, we develop a model that focuses attention on one type of information, namely, the ideological position of previous adopters. Although not the only piece of relevant information, we believe that states look to the previous adopters in an effort to minimize the uncertainty about how issues fit in the liberalconservative policy space. We test this theory in three different policy areas, finding consistent evidence that ideological cues help states learn about policy innovations while replicating important findings from previous research.",32,5,521,545,Public policy; Policy analysis; Ideology; Economics; Position (finance); State (polity); Space (commercial competition); Test (assessment); Relevant information; Public relations,,,,,https://apr.sagepub.com/content/32/5/521 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X04263801 https://apr.sagepub.com/content/32/5/521.full.pdf http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X04263801 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X04263801,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532673x04263801,,10.1177/1532673x04263801,1976368823,,0,001-455-034-432-264; 007-665-008-937-684; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-454-798-334-448; 028-730-064-064-304; 036-961-749-635-681; 045-601-947-266-343; 047-558-081-081-541; 061-024-976-652-254; 061-904-727-066-671; 065-296-005-360-202; 065-657-907-093-917; 067-490-686-317-462; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 084-787-681-556-687; 086-912-722-853-93X; 097-416-968-699-086; 100-204-635-834-413; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 109-581-103-469-815; 113-824-004-354-930; 115-631-793-638-558; 131-900-393-723-959; 164-951-410-210-731; 171-294-938-530-246; 176-477-098-858-938,273,false,,

A more nuanced perspective of policy adoption taking into account gradual differences between adoption and non-adoption is proposed with this paper, valid for diffusion among communities and states in federal settings and among countries on the global level. Besides the aspect of visibility, intentions are also important when measures are adopted. While some measures are transferred with a clear instrumental aim, others are rather transferred for symbolical reasons. Looking at specific processes, the paper proposes a concept that disentangles the current understanding of policy diffusion and provides empirical evidence that current diffusion research misconceives instances. The four different transfer types are illustrated with empirical evidence from sub-national energy policy-making in Switzerland. The systematic investigation of the cases allows to finding explanations for the different transfer types.",45,4,385,398,Positive economics; Diffusion (business); Economics; Empirical evidence; Perspective (graphical); Legislation; Visibility (geometry); Facticity; Public administration; Energy (esotericism),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/policy/v45y2012i4p385-398.html https://econpapers.repec.org/article/kappolicy/v_3a45_3ay_3a2012_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a385-398.htm https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11077-012-9161-y.pdf http://www.zora.uzh.ch/66217 https://core.ac.uk/display/11293712 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11077-012-9161-y https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/66217/11/ZORA_NL_66217.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-012-9161-y,,10.1007/s11077-012-9161-y,2020418849,,0,007-758-759-157-059; 012-286-853-432-764; 012-467-150-825-142; 016-611-103-288-160; 023-357-334-064-714; 025-112-618-417-304; 026-156-902-199-704; 026-723-940-576-417; 028-355-372-379-859; 029-352-945-923-165; 029-694-779-807-168; 032-164-929-841-901; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-689-436-224-80X; 036-353-022-660-131; 036-375-305-477-406; 036-961-749-635-681; 040-045-514-053-856; 043-283-110-483-043; 043-547-850-265-638; 048-624-554-561-959; 053-271-230-795-943; 057-691-389-520-227; 058-071-798-060-611; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-905-690-168-04X; 068-915-539-143-906; 069-067-510-293-836; 069-417-875-151-467; 069-457-614-505-200; 071-652-138-480-545; 074-591-312-235-434; 075-046-752-556-824; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 080-285-338-290-10X; 081-652-697-451-014; 083-128-427-871-272; 091-380-232-071-077; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-223-604-728-585; 112-333-966-495-520; 115-082-821-456-542; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 119-306-794-156-178; 120-313-848-594-845; 120-610-824-268-907; 129-940-764-267-556; 143-240-575-082-851; 149-724-894-654-457; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-637-734-144-951; 185-022-874-564-293; 187-151-090-396-571; 195-867-013-582-438,19,true,,green

Quinn; A. Maria Toyoda,"Introduction Scholars have long argued that the spread of ideas and values matters for the adaptation and reform of government policies. (See, for example, the essays in Hall 1989.) In this chapter, we investigate whether and how either liberal or restrictive international financial policies on capital account regulation spread globally, both through the direct effects of changes in global ideology on government policy and indirectly, through policy diffusion between other states. In the following sections we: (1) provide a detailed account of the mechanisms of diffusion, focusing on the theoretical basis for the global, grassroots spread of ideas that affect government policies; (2) identify valid indicators of ideological change that will aid in identifying the mechanisms through which it is diffused; (3) discuss our models and methods, focusing on how ideology is diffused indirectly and globally through influence on other governments' policies; and (4) report the results of our study, and offer concluding remarks. How ideas spread While global convergence toward political and economic liberalism might be a defining story of the last two decades of the twentieth century, we find scant evidence that convergence around a particular set of policies regarding capital account liberalization is consistent over time or space. During the entire twentieth century, many distinct waves of international financial openness and closure diffused worldwide. Based upon the work of many scholars, we know many of the domestic and international political and economic forces that account for change in international financial openness.",,,173,219,Public policy; Political economy; Ideology; Political science; Political sociology; Grassroots; Conditionality; Capital account; Economic liberalism; Economic liberalization; Economic system,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/global-diffusion-of-markets-and-democracy/global-ideology-and-voter-sentiment-as-determinants-of-international-financial-liberalization/CB9B0AD3EF45795C1542FF6C1C42BCB7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511755941.005,,10.1017/cbo9780511755941.005,377765045,,0,003-844-247-089-713; 004-658-565-245-731; 006-856-695-254-88X; 010-932-514-368-658; 013-171-402-117-489; 016-886-065-968-933; 017-010-933-750-388; 018-549-389-297-510; 019-725-629-062-902; 023-341-183-390-785; 024-813-983-826-750; 025-063-472-203-881; 031-048-174-556-138; 031-253-084-483-249; 031-501-671-180-285; 031-643-146-545-980; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-311-933-183-326; 040-718-826-204-178; 042-335-426-642-552; 046-127-203-871-082; 046-307-522-631-113; 058-418-465-913-030; 064-622-781-852-765; 067-790-225-337-078; 068-322-385-830-32X; 071-846-033-952-37X; 072-729-029-877-024; 075-094-775-270-753; 075-804-393-713-532; 077-926-704-396-107; 085-179-386-712-496; 087-624-124-579-168; 090-697-429-001-565; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-493-182-382-669; 094-585-621-391-03X; 104-981-334-641-02X; 106-538-155-634-736; 113-741-307-551-153; 118-767-489-920-542; 122-909-673-961-681; 129-330-344-786-837; 130-524-493-616-074; 131-201-234-130-563; 131-502-649-538-682; 132-558-492-977-554; 140-212-810-563-253; 141-424-611-018-456; 147-411-356-513-032; 149-653-094-041-358; 151-577-849-675-819; 156-264-681-585-610; 162-717-451-214-458; 179-733-923-640-680; 181-709-557-804-738; 188-035-998-584-503; 194-118-256-080-614,4,false,,

However, contraceptive access varies by social and geographic position, with policies either perpetuating or alleviating health inequities. We describe geographic and time-trend variation in an index from fewer (less expansive) to greater (more expansive) aggregation of U.S. state-level contraceptive access policies across 50 states and Washington, D.C. (collectively, states) from 2006 to 2021. We collected data from primary and secondary sources on 23 policies regulating contraceptive education, insurance coverage, minor's rights, provider authority, and more. As of 2021, the most enacted policies expanded contraceptive access through: 1) prescribing authority for nurse practitioners, certified nurse-midwives (n = 50, 98 % of states), and clinical nurse specialists (n = 38, 75 %); 2) Medicaid expansion (n = 38, 75 %); 3) prescription method insurance coverage (n = 30, 59 %); and 4) dispensing authority for nurse practitioners and certified nurse-midwives (n = 29, 57 %). The average overall U.S. policy index value increased in expansiveness from 6.9 in 2006 to 8.6 in 2021. States in the West and Northeast regions had the most expansive contraceptive access landscapes (average index values of 9.0 and 8.2, respectively) and grew more expansive over time (increased by 4-5 policies). The Midwest and South had least expansive landscapes (average index values of 5.0 and 6.1, respectively). Regions with more expansive sexual and reproductive health policy environments further expanded access, whereas least expansive environments were maintained.

The analytical result shows that the diffusion pattern of the local acts as policy innovations can be characterized as quasi-reviving diffusion. It also reveals that the decision and time to adopt the act of the upper-tier local government are important factors for intrajurisdictional diffusion of the act. This paper vefies that there is a close relationship between time and the diffusion pattern. Of course, time is not the only factor explaining the diffusion pattern of local policies across local governments, which can be corroborated by the fact that the diffusion trends of the local act vary depending on the adoption statuses of the upper governments.

This study is an effort to expand our understanding of policy diffusion by analyzing the diffusion of 23 innovative tort doctrines among state court systems between 1876 and 1975. This analysis examines the innovativeness of state judicial systems, the correlates of innovativeness, and the pattern of diffusion. The findings suggest that the diffusion of judicial doctrines is a very different process from the diffusion of legislation.

The author discusses policy learning against the background of recent research on the diffusion of deregulatory and regulatory policies and attempts to distinguish learning from other mechanisms of diffusion. She then surveys the challenges entailed in testing this mechanism and sets out her particular approach: a rational version of learning. She also reports the results of preliminary efforts to test learning as applied to the diffusion of regulatory policies. The author concludes that learning cannot be rejected as a plausible mechanism of the diffusion of policies, although it shares its explanatory role with less rational mechanisms of diffusion, in particular policy emulation. Further research and analysis is needed to test learning in either its rational or its bounded version and, in doing so, to delve into the politics of learning.",598,1,67,82,Public economics; Positive economics; Emulation; Economics; Order (exchange); Making-of; Test (assessment); Context (language use); Mechanism (sociology); Bounded function; Politics,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/71802691 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002716204272372 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716204272372 https://ann.sagepub.com/content/598/1/67.abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002716204272372,,10.1177/0002716204272372,2132571705,,0,003-385-208-991-130; 004-742-002-990-967; 005-249-461-623-469; 012-286-853-432-764; 012-976-032-110-088; 020-875-132-641-289; 022-647-297-623-052; 023-451-330-148-233; 025-063-472-203-881; 027-747-799-895-947; 030-043-894-262-454; 034-848-902-413-624; 036-514-597-418-009; 046-307-522-631-113; 046-871-834-972-803; 052-723-818-069-06X; 061-054-885-411-161; 063-504-944-027-038; 068-097-629-734-935; 069-046-835-164-327; 074-317-924-914-874; 074-873-178-338-584; 077-926-704-396-107; 088-993-237-313-315; 091-729-566-642-692; 094-833-126-001-305; 098-353-841-797-309; 100-656-824-167-370; 103-920-739-380-598; 110-500-510-520-460; 115-824-330-262-68X; 117-446-188-442-491; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-804-074-221-213; 129-335-838-364-944; 133-087-716-464-773; 134-791-423-550-200; 153-933-388-959-472; 182-691-994-546-128; 184-422-743-876-664,307,false,,

In order to address these questions, a theoretical framework for making sense of how and why policy convergence happens in the EU is required. To start, we briefly outline the shortcomings of the most prominent theoretical approach, namely top-down Europeanisation, for explaining convergence in policy areas in which the EU has no legal competence, such as the third pillar of EU governance. Then two alternative approaches, better suited to understanding the potential impact of the EU in these policy areas, are presented. In contrast to the top-down approach, ‘interactive Europeanisation’ conceptualises Europeanisation as a process that involves not only hierarchical (top-down) processes, but also bottom-up processes, whereby domestic actors seek to upload norms and policy positions to the European arena, and horizontal processes, whereby norms can be diffused across member states using the EU as a facilitator of norm and policy diffusion. A third approach to policy convergence emphasises domestic determinants, suggesting that it is not Europe that is the catalyst for change but the domestic political and ideological constellation in individual member states. Finally, drawing on the logic of these approaches, the chapter identifies a number of competing hypotheses to structure the subsequent empirical investigation.",,,10,27,Norm (social); Ideology; Political science; Order (exchange); Facilitator; Member state; Europeanisation; Corporate governance; Economic system; Politics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230353305_2 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230353305_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230353305_2,,10.1057/9780230353305_2,2493855988,,0,023-553-646-605-047; 026-412-549-797-331; 072-862-908-678-93X; 087-672-113-340-684; 099-956-410-004-10X; 112-962-096-683-174; 120-796-629-160-114; 146-213-796-969-064; 173-828-957-268-286,0,false,,

Apart from our concern to critically review this literature, our aim is also to focus in on one of its greatest deficiencies: the absence, hitherto, of a comprehensive, multi-level framework for analysis, capable of specifying the conditions under which OMC practices are likely to produce a convergence of member state policies on common objectives. In doing so we also bring into our account a parallel literature – on policy diffusion and learning – that is frequently referred to by studies of the OMC and other new modes of governance but is rarely integrated systematically into their analysis.",,,,,Public economics; Political science; European integration; Convergence (economics); Member state; Open method of coordination; Deliberative democracy; European union; Corporate governance; Normative,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/erpeurogo/p0011.htm https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/6693 http://edoc.vifapol.de/opus/volltexte/2011/2463/pdf/egp_newgov_N_07_01.pdf http://edoc.vifapol.de/opus/volltexte/2011/2463/,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/erpeurogo/p0011.htm,,,1521674589,,0,,54,false,,

What are the international factors that explain the diffusion of this regulatory policy? Research on policy diffusion offers several explanations: constructivist, coercion, competition, and learning. Each of these theories is explored based on a dataset that tracks the implementation of number portability, fixed phone competition and mobile phone competition, and documentary evidence gathered from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), European Union, and the Inter-American Telecommunications Commission (CITEL). In these three regulatory issue areas, Asia, Americas, and Europe are the three regions that innovate first; Middle East and Africa follow later on. Further, Hong Kong and New Zealand in Asia and Canada, Chile, and the US in Americas are pioneers, while others wait to see results before proceeding; learning appears to explain the diffusion pattern in these regions. In contrast, in Europe, regulatory diffusion begins early and proceeds rapidly with pioneers like Finland and United Kingdom, but others adopt without the lag time observed in Asia and Americas, very likely because of the leadership and enforcement powers of the European Union, a coercive explanation among member states and a competitive one among non-member states.",1,95,111,132,International trade; Political science; Commission; Phone; Enforcement; Competition (economics); European union; Middle East; Single market; Documentary evidence,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:idt:journl:cs9505 https://ideas.repec.org/a/idt/journl/cs9505.html,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:idt:journl:cs9505,,,3124187237,,0,,0,false,,

Cross-national learning is said to be one of the key mechanisms by which ideas, policies, and administrative reforms travel across jurisdictions. However, it is also said to be fraught with several difficulties, and thus to hardly exert any significant influence on policymaking. This thesis addresses this puzzle through various means. It asks a set of research questions and proposes an analytical framework to explore the relationship between cross-national learning and policy change. It then traces the making of Management for Results policies in Chile and Mexico, comparing policy developments in both countries across two decades (1990-2010). The thesis challenges conventional scholarly accounts on this subject. It shows that cross-national learning might bring about significant policy changes. However, this does not necessarily occur through the transfer or diffusion of policies or models intact. It happens through policymakers’ use of knowledge from policies abroad in many ways and at various stages of the policymaking process. Moreover, policy changes are neither secured once policy elements are adopted, nor are they completed once their process of adaptation to a receiving environment has started. In fact, policymakers need to devise strategies to ensure the new policies are effective, legitimate, and durable. Full policy convergence does not necessarily happen, but neither does absolute divergence. Across time, through sequences of learning and change, policymakers learn how to overcome cognitive biases and national barriers; how to combine experiential learning and knowledge from policies abroad; and how to better fit policies to their national conditions, while also keeping them in tune with international policy developments.",,,,,Public economics; Policy analysis; Knowledge economy; Set (psychology); Political science; Policy studies; Divergence (linguistics); Policy transfer; Making-of; Public administration; Experiential learning,,,,,http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/718/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.579479,http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/718/,,,1604149177,,0,,2,false,,
007-945-311-647-600,"Policy Diffusion, Lobbying and the Taxation of Emissions",,2008,,,,,,Peter Michaelis; Thomas Ziesemer,"Policy diffusion refers to the process by which a political innovation – like the introduction of a novel emission tax – disseminates over time among countries. In order to analyze this issue from an economic point of view we develop a simple two-country-model of the taxation of emissions in presence of (possible) policy diffusion. Contrary to the usual Nash setting of simultaneous decision making we consider a Stackelberg game: In the first step the domestic government introduces an emission tax td thus acting as Stackelberg-leader, in the second step the foreign government decides whether or not to introduce an emission tax tf and in the third step the firms decide on their output quantities to be sold on a third country’s market. For the case of an exogenous given probability of policy diffusion we show that the optimal domestic tax rate is c.p. the higher, the higher the probability of policy diffusion is. Moreover, we explore under which conditions first-mover behaviour by the domestic government leads to a higher tax rate compared to the Nash solution In the next step we introduce an endogenous probability of policy diffusion by combining our model with a strategic lobbying approach. As a result, the probability of policy diffusion is c.p. the smaller, the higher domestic tax rate td is. Consequently, in fixing the optimal tax rate the domestic government has to account for the foreign firm’s lobbying activities otherwise it will choose a tax rate too high.",,,,,Diffusion (business); Discount points; Government; Economics; Microeconomics; Order (exchange); Stackelberg competition; Optimal tax; Tax rate; Politics,,,,,,,,,3140294223,,0,,0,false,,

A poststructural analysis,2019-01-15,2019,journal article,Globalization and health,17448603,BioMed Central,United Kingdom,Lara Gautier; Manuela De Allegri; Valéry Ridde,"Performance-based financing (PBF) in low- and middle-income settings has diffused at an unusually rapid pace. While many studies have looked at PBF implementation processes and effects, there is an empirical research gap investigating the ways PBF has diffused. Discursive processes are paramount elements of policy diffusion because they explain the origins of essential elements of the political debate on PBF. Using Bacchi’s poststructural approach that emphasises problem representations embedded in the discourse, the present study analyses the construction of the global discourse on PBF. A rich corpus of qualitative data (57 in-depth interviews and 10 observation notes) was collected. The transcribed material was coded using QDAMiner©. Codes were assembled to populate analytical categories informed by the framework on diffusion entrepeneurs and Bacchi’s poststructural approach. Our results feature problem representations shaped and spread by PBF global diffusion entrepreneurs. We explain how these representations reflected diffusion entrepreneurs’ own belief systems and interests, and conflicted with those of non-diffusion entrepreneurs. This research also reveals the specific strategies global diffusion entrepreneurs engaged in to effectively diffuse PBF, through reflecting problem representations based on the discourse on PBF, and inducing certain forms of policy experimentation, emulation, and learning. Bacchi’s poststructural approach is useful to analyse the construction of global health problem representations and the strategies set by global diffusion entrepreneurs to spread these representations. Future research is needed to investigate the belief systems, motivations, resources, and strategies of actors that shape the construction of global health discourses.",15,1,6,6,Epistemology; Empirical research; Sociology; Set (psychology); Social policy; Pace; Belief system; Performance based financing; Qualitative property; Politics,Diffusion entrepreneurs; Global discourse; Performance-based financing; Poststructural analysis,"Delivery of Health Care/organization & administration; Developing Countries/economics; Female; Healthcare Financing; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Reimbursement, Incentive",,CIHR (372369) Canada,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646933 https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-018-0443-9 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30646933/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12992-018-0443-9.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30646933 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12992-018-0443-9 https://core.ac.uk/download/187762786.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12992-018-0443-9,30646933,10.1186/s12992-018-0443-9,2909461113,PMC6332594,0,005-244-040-291-424; 005-947-483-421-444; 008-293-510-564-74X; 009-233-094-809-905; 009-598-609-238-77X; 017-967-623-762-675; 021-250-032-182-341; 022-158-775-586-974; 025-514-143-614-153; 027-224-230-923-787; 028-835-254-762-550; 030-992-145-760-805; 032-101-972-478-206; 033-039-492-300-494; 036-570-308-449-551; 038-136-655-947-548; 039-104-018-584-932; 041-583-667-727-414; 043-786-671-537-704; 044-131-077-370-007; 045-392-908-977-451; 046-807-684-862-329; 057-327-679-339-871; 058-803-429-870-919; 059-503-754-399-069; 060-076-769-181-603; 066-259-371-885-272; 068-034-002-647-047; 070-094-196-648-57X; 073-004-253-478-392; 075-252-329-763-743; 078-119-088-861-68X; 083-165-538-558-695; 086-564-608-090-213; 089-178-730-675-956; 091-785-174-701-40X; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-354-971-728-773; 097-481-219-653-911; 098-970-622-402-761; 101-619-904-036-526; 104-195-112-461-981; 108-105-789-887-443; 112-015-579-355-129; 112-944-478-565-334; 113-931-060-598-255; 114-618-305-217-007; 115-604-021-260-635; 118-233-296-676-313; 123-915-817-443-646; 127-973-936-501-221; 133-639-962-835-165; 148-460-439-813-652; 149-383-888-312-941; 149-515-881-473-656; 152-537-117-145-273; 175-488-595-216-407; 178-806-927-901-524; 178-880-089-431-660; 185-637-833-923-57X,51,true,"CC BY, CC0",gold

J. Nykiforuk; John Eyles; H. Sharon Campbell,"Policy diffusion is a process whereby political bodies 'learn' policy solutions to public health problems by imitating policy from similar jurisdictions. This suggests that diffusion is a critical element in the policy development process, and that its role must be recognised in any examination of policy development. Yet, to date, no systematic work on the diffusion of smoke-free spaces bylaws has been reported. We examined the diffusion of municipal smoke-free bylaws over a 30-year period in the provinces of Alberta and Ontario, Canada, to begin to address this gap and to determine whether spatial patterns could be identified to help explain the nature of policy development. Bylaw adoption and change were analysed within local, regional, and provincial contexts. Geographical models of hierarchical and expansion diffusion in conjunction with the diffusion of innovations framework conceptually guided the analyses. Study findings contribute to a broader understanding of how and why health policies diffuse across time and place. Policy development can be a powerful mechanism for creating environments that support healthy decisions; hence, an understanding of policy diffusion is critical for those interested in policy interventions aimed at improving population health in any jurisdiction.",16,1,64,74,Public economics; Policy analysis; Public health; Economics; Work (electrical); Element (criminal law); Jurisdiction; Population health; Diffusion of innovations; Economic growth; Politics,,Alberta; Cities/legislation & jurisprudence; Health Policy/legislation & jurisprudence; Humans; Ontario; Smoking/legislation & jurisprudence; Tobacco Smoke Pollution/prevention & control,Tobacco Smoke Pollution,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2524.2007.00727.x https://europepmc.org/article/MED/18181816 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18181816/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2524.2007.00727.x/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18181816,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2524.2007.00727.x,18181816,10.1111/j.1365-2524.2007.00727.x,1485640855,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 001-732-296-516-110; 003-249-351-841-235; 003-837-207-727-316; 004-122-800-366-627; 004-255-917-348-835; 004-718-430-782-793; 005-025-554-322-320; 007-061-641-140-075; 007-158-528-772-039; 009-656-889-635-114; 010-546-459-486-524; 011-224-015-287-916; 012-547-632-605-329; 013-546-392-788-796; 013-753-092-836-866; 013-811-924-125-139; 016-114-142-209-093; 017-069-768-109-090; 017-818-796-147-575; 020-317-774-043-858; 022-137-266-959-282; 024-081-667-335-318; 026-177-937-192-193; 026-617-808-215-885; 031-375-413-957-536; 032-164-929-841-901; 035-818-608-602-781; 036-514-963-984-204; 039-318-000-420-191; 040-946-717-283-510; 051-911-671-334-413; 054-565-524-911-903; 057-425-712-404-620; 061-435-649-367-620; 063-265-891-048-533; 064-748-247-604-247; 080-338-454-506-613; 081-014-559-024-472; 085-218-107-425-232; 086-932-862-376-360; 091-745-187-743-856; 093-292-153-464-73X; 096-142-866-186-405; 096-242-156-058-212; 106-559-170-465-363; 109-650-789-617-988; 112-372-683-404-002; 115-923-906-095-321; 126-461-256-490-121; 128-955-543-483-090; 129-456-785-926-907; 132-819-828-269-838; 138-952-173-018-704; 151-338-078-841-250; 163-335-749-333-41X,32,false,,

But does the scope of this cross-national policy diffusion vary with the party family that generates those incumbents? The authors argue that party family conditions transnational policy learning when it makes information on the positions of sister parties more readily available and relevant. Both conditions apply to social democratic parties. Unlike other party families, social democrats have faced major competitive challenges since the 1970s and they exhibit exceptionally strong transnational organizations—factors, the authors contend, that uniquely facilitate cross-national policy learning from successful parties within the family. The authors analyze parties’ policy positions using spatial methods and find that social democratic parties are indeed exceptional because they emulate one another across borders more than do Christian democratic and conservative parties. These findings have important implications for our understanding of political representation and of social democratic parties’ election strategies over the past forty years.",73,3,512,544,Political economy; Political science; Representation (politics); Sister; Exceptionalism; Social Democratic Party; Spatial methods; Social democracy; Democracy; Politics,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/social-democratic-party-exceptionalism-and-transnational-policy-linkages/D0BF0E4216254E76225C26CE4D3C7300 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/29544/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0043887121000022,,10.1017/s0043887121000022,3159974717,,0,000-765-681-939-915; 001-395-951-861-128; 002-090-110-364-521; 002-577-980-557-663; 004-336-147-101-733; 004-467-751-543-853; 004-631-503-280-013; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-439-868-038-998; 005-553-153-856-945; 005-824-003-083-272; 006-072-850-561-64X; 007-573-637-773-40X; 008-333-086-329-583; 009-260-633-908-392; 009-465-721-986-453; 009-568-078-394-10X; 010-003-191-094-552; 010-947-899-562-815; 013-721-955-273-688; 014-998-066-812-811; 015-753-547-305-299; 018-006-207-122-840; 018-599-489-876-11X; 019-593-563-364-999; 019-933-114-114-44X; 024-032-410-411-820; 026-308-629-321-341; 026-580-524-578-530; 026-775-594-060-761; 030-716-503-815-626; 032-746-262-158-468; 033-085-475-899-252; 035-508-711-491-174; 039-412-520-002-824; 041-092-948-304-622; 041-659-281-349-623; 042-848-125-795-604; 046-112-289-222-566; 048-384-936-724-987; 052-957-372-948-888; 055-028-821-073-582; 056-910-712-658-113; 058-418-465-913-030; 059-053-383-988-642; 061-119-463-691-911; 061-162-133-058-674; 061-373-791-267-531; 061-973-970-085-871; 062-485-449-660-63X; 062-613-015-440-350; 064-671-173-784-907; 066-147-575-518-38X; 067-791-588-273-557; 069-208-127-389-559; 070-529-090-989-026; 070-992-501-063-733; 072-090-829-344-184; 073-123-674-530-568; 074-881-381-853-266; 075-089-695-295-014; 080-378-424-661-571; 082-017-566-839-450; 082-935-382-089-440; 083-128-427-871-272; 083-620-105-108-236; 083-835-412-631-56X; 084-910-340-397-172; 088-375-208-918-739; 092-810-759-587-647; 092-898-541-631-691; 093-190-746-631-057; 095-211-909-469-422; 100-480-395-535-166; 100-947-929-853-123; 101-484-000-562-78X; 103-902-823-322-498; 105-521-696-637-174; 111-228-501-144-172; 111-649-892-201-407; 115-292-903-924-077; 115-716-554-714-093; 117-677-347-760-402; 119-920-962-885-899; 122-321-798-500-697; 124-543-671-647-444; 125-139-828-437-413; 126-255-036-882-142; 127-220-108-018-000; 129-543-580-966-505; 129-827-239-773-157; 130-715-233-590-308; 131-643-670-951-235; 132-681-646-135-346; 137-051-141-347-832; 138-524-873-922-154; 142-472-386-597-641; 145-508-832-944-692; 148-223-435-969-407; 155-335-253-403-496; 155-840-578-843-016; 156-586-921-097-184; 157-471-694-925-950; 157-505-738-635-158; 162-349-878-455-756; 163-926-847-617-824; 165-123-223-524-463; 165-365-808-288-090; 170-851-664-310-256; 173-445-526-721-132; 179-348-929-516-428; 183-073-882-602-517; 183-901-586-824-167; 187-154-798-224-162; 187-583-747-235-000; 188-007-362-092-361; 191-576-547-326-29X; 195-269-139-186-377; 199-095-273-591-179,2,true,,green

It seems intuitive that policymakers would find infertility treatments an easier sell, yet 26 states have contraceptive mandates while only 15 states have mandated infertility coverage. Why? This paper contributes to the policy diffusion literature by examining the ability of the media to elevate issue salience and influence how the public addresses certain issues. Using panel data from 1987 to 2011 and a Generalized Additive Model (GAM), we find that contraceptive insurance initiatives gained traction in state legislatures after the emergence of Viagra onto health care plans, and the resultant public media debate, allowed proponents to portray contraceptive insurance as a method of battling gender discrimination in the U.S. health system. Infertility coverage, in contrast, has been (and continues to be) perceived as a personal misfortune not requiring a policy response.",,,,,Public economics; Health care; Actuarial science; Political science; Infertility; Abortion; Family planning policy; Infertility treatments; Panel data; Legislature; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2300492,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2300492,,,2279351583,,0,020-769-759-044-534,0,false,,

In the first half, this paper reviews some of the trends in the literature by looking backwards to the political science diffusion literature, and forwards to the expanding multi-disciplinary social science literatures on policy ‘learning’, ‘mobilities’ and ‘translation’ which qualify many of the rationalist assumptions of the early diffusion/transfer literatures. These studies stress the complexity of context that modifies exports of policy and the need for interpretation or experimentalism in the assemblage of policy. The second half of the paper focuses on role of international organisations and non-state actors in transnational transfer in the spread of norms, standard setting and development of professional communities or networks that promote harmonisation and policy coordination. The ‘soft’ transfer of ideas and information via networks whether they be personal, professional or electronic is rapid and frequen...",33,6,483,499,Positive economics; Sociology; Foreign policy analysis; Policy studies; Policy transfer; Mobilities; Transnational governance; Experimentalism; Context (language use); Public administration; Interpretation (philosophy),,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/9561381 https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01442872.2012.695933 https://researchprofiles.canberra.edu.au/en/publications/transfer-and-translation-of-policy https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/transfer-and-translation-of-policy https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01442872.2012.695933 https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/50661/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2012.695933,,10.1080/01442872.2012.695933,2163620691,,0,001-472-214-157-188; 007-450-538-799-057; 009-638-161-462-602; 010-314-314-468-912; 012-467-150-825-142; 016-981-134-371-66X; 017-010-933-750-388; 017-928-849-887-225; 018-338-360-539-272; 019-155-409-064-904; 021-272-878-103-683; 030-716-612-544-343; 052-340-235-749-831; 053-834-108-010-010; 058-071-798-060-611; 065-817-341-398-18X; 077-945-151-328-246; 080-263-574-946-417; 086-163-694-850-604; 095-926-166-209-070; 097-619-405-643-951; 105-268-633-872-269; 108-947-194-847-363; 113-741-307-551-153; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-708-779-230-498; 120-610-824-268-907; 129-038-185-433-517; 137-849-796-205-184; 151-957-596-917-668; 161-009-591-645-619; 161-411-496-325-110; 177-785-069-398-865; 199-693-868-725-551,327,false,,

Feeney,"Open government is an important innovation to foster trustworthy and inclusive governments. The authors develop and test an integrative theoretical framework drawing from theories on policy diffusion and innovation adoption. Based on this, they investigate how structural, cultural, and environmental variables explain three dimensions of open government: accessibility, transparency, and participation. The framework is tested by combining 2014 survey data and observational data from 500 local U.S. government websites. Organizational structure, including technological and organizational capacity, is a determinant shared by all dimensions of open government. Furthermore, accessibility is affected by a mixture of an innovative and participative culture and external pressures. A flexible and innovative culture positively relates to higher levels of transparency, whereas capacity is a strong predictor of adopting participatory features. The main conclusion is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to fostering the three dimensions of open government, as each dimension is subject to a unique combination of determinants.",77,4,579,590,Business; Government; Organizational structure; Survey data collection; Citizen journalism; Open government; Test (assessment); Dimension (data warehouse); Transparency (behavior); Public relations; Knowledge management,,,,,http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/380233 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fpuar.12689 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F380233 https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/developing-and-testing-an-integrative-framework-for-open-governme http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12689/abstract https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12689,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/puar.12689,,10.1111/puar.12689,2555230195,,0,000-070-470-984-440; 005-987-827-436-137; 007-819-101-185-076; 009-479-463-287-218; 009-862-549-724-708; 010-580-438-028-363; 013-119-111-595-159; 016-626-406-274-462; 017-711-086-512-953; 017-725-098-074-484; 020-067-709-218-691; 020-679-097-837-535; 022-512-643-506-628; 025-641-929-232-335; 028-703-941-322-608; 030-988-888-480-706; 037-615-652-998-608; 037-826-400-992-285; 041-158-991-692-121; 043-887-800-056-88X; 044-260-171-810-233; 044-324-243-779-512; 046-964-223-457-354; 051-601-133-228-097; 053-688-945-833-396; 056-077-059-538-567; 057-482-100-124-362; 058-071-798-060-611; 060-195-140-600-518; 061-643-997-110-633; 072-239-178-756-507; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-172-488-686-485; 077-625-671-588-567; 078-455-009-415-706; 084-419-535-897-070; 086-174-990-155-52X; 087-388-072-861-011; 090-636-221-923-414; 093-650-551-450-381; 093-845-246-015-973; 100-507-913-996-489; 100-709-864-053-032; 105-788-383-680-326; 113-328-117-971-57X; 115-482-499-323-938; 118-403-204-347-432; 120-021-341-582-904; 132-335-797-150-736; 139-903-220-108-741; 143-366-406-269-045; 157-536-932-059-141; 175-722-157-924-123; 191-722-648-796-218,102,true,,green

010-038-128-112-316,Essays on policy diffusion,2020-08-01,2020,dissertation,,,,,Farzad Vaziri,"This thesis consists of three essays on policy diffusion which looks at the conditional diffusion of policies based on domestic political factors. It attempts to shed light on how different domestic political factors affect policy diffusion among independent but interrelated actors such as governments. To start, I argue that understanding the effects of unit heterogeneity or more specifically domestic political factors is essential for the understanding of the policy diffusion process. I speculate that this domestic factors’ conditionality is less developed in the literature, for example in contrast to network conditionality, and needs more studies. In three chapters, I look at one theoretical approach using Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) to analyse the effects of domestic politics on the diffusion process, and then it provides two empirical examples in Environmental Spending and Tax Rates Competition. In the first paper/chapter ""Domestic and International Determinants of Policy Diffusion: An Agent-Based Approach"", using ABM simulation I show how differences in domestic politics or actors’ and voters’ preferences can affect the process of diffusion throughout the whole network of diffusion. This paper focuses on polarisation in voter preferences and conflict between political agents as an example of domestic political factors and shows how changes in such factors can lead to different diffusion macro patterns and characteristics. In the second paper/chapter “Conditional Political Determinants of Environmental Spending Diffusion” I look at the conditional responsiveness of different European states based on their government’s ideological tendencies. I show that such ideological tendencies can affect the diffusion process and the responsiveness of governments towards international stimuli. I argue that in a polarised policy area such as environmental spending different actors fit the roles of leaders or followers depending on the cots and expectations, which will affect their responsiveness to changes in other jurisdictions. In the third paper/chapter “Political Determinants of International Tax Rates’ Diffusion in Europe” I look at diffusion conditionality when alternative and related policy choices exist. I show that domestic preferences can translate into different responses in different alternative policy areas and spatial effects can conditionally spill over from one policy area into another policy area depending on actor’s preferences. Looking at corporate and personal income tax rates as related areas, this third paper finds evidence that links different level of domestic conditionality to the level of international determination in different policy areas, provides evidence that competition or diffusion pressure can spill over from one area to another. I propose that ABM as a theoretical tool, better use of econometrics tools and a more understanding of domestic politics can add to our understanding of policy diffusion process.",,,,,Public economics; Government; Ideology; Economics; Macro; Competition (economics); Conditionality; Affect (psychology); Unit (housing); Politics,,,,,http://repository.essex.ac.uk/28479/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.814944,http://repository.essex.ac.uk/28479/,,,3095505524,,0,,0,false,,

As a local control state, Colorado cities, municipalities, and counties may choose whether or not to adopt marijuana legalization policies in their jurisdictions and how to do so. This research is based on survey and panel data from Colorado local officials regarding issues of adoption and implementation in their jurisdictions. Overall, the initial findings show that the decision regarding adoption was a result of a combination of policy determinants (both cultural and economic) and policy diffusion (from prior policies on medical marijuana). Factors related to public opinion, economics, and prior policy on medical marijuana affected both the decision to permit and the decision to prohibit. Policy diffusion also appears important in early implementation, as cities use the existing medical marijuana policies to shape recreational marijuana policies.",47,3,193,204,Public economics; Recreation; Public opinion; Business; Policy studies; Control (management); State (polity); Local government; Marijuana legalization; Public administration; Panel data,,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0160323x15612149 https://slg.sagepub.com/content/47/3/193.abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0160323x15612149,,10.1177/0160323x15612149,2357187018,,0,000-423-479-589-923; 005-692-270-875-15X; 011-659-464-522-304; 019-456-406-334-322; 022-376-850-088-250; 037-306-656-996-774; 041-188-952-161-384; 052-252-031-072-654; 057-912-616-316-805; 058-071-798-060-611; 076-240-693-922-091; 098-419-626-337-536; 101-445-765-900-11X; 101-488-954-100-242; 155-580-858-393-517,10,false,,

But how well do they really meet these expectations? Focusing on the diffusion of pertinent policies in local, rural Austria, we analyse whether the policy diffusion has induced procedural, political and programmatic effects and, if so, how it was accomplished. The results fall short of expectations.Although it is widely acknowledged that municipalities play an important role in the transition towards sustainable development and climate change mitigation, there is a notable lack of studies focusing on the diffusion of pertinent policies at the local level. This paper analyses the diffusion of sustainable development and climate change mitigation policies in rural Austrian municipalities. We scrutinise the policy diffusion rates and patterns. In doing so, we ask whether policy diffusion has induced procedural, political and programmatic effects within the rural government context and, if so, how these changes were accomplished. The results show that the lack of political commitment, political incoherency and insufficient support are major barriers impeding diffusion and implementation. Insufficient programmatic effects are explained by the fact that only “easier” measures have so far been implemented. These “easy” measures stop short of profoundly tackling structural problems or challenging current practices. In contrast to the high expectations regarding the role of municipalities in transitioning towards sustainability and climate-friendly practices, municipalities appear not to have the competencies nor the capacities to implement far-reaching, system-changing measures on their own.</jats:p>",30,3,189,197,Tracing; Economics; Political change; Municipal level; Climate change mitigation; Sustainable development; Environmental planning,,,,,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oekom/gaia/2021/00000030/00000003/art00012,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.30.3.12,,10.14512/gaia.30.3.12,3208658536,,0,001-367-136-082-787; 004-870-676-018-804; 007-413-555-491-051; 012-883-251-761-670; 017-345-161-534-590; 018-606-574-430-262; 020-071-393-865-885; 036-986-653-337-103; 044-336-413-130-539; 045-007-876-697-645; 050-274-654-059-514; 051-563-283-713-00X; 052-418-530-343-84X; 052-843-910-884-143; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-275-475-629-425; 060-040-428-192-561; 062-912-666-925-474; 077-523-855-589-09X; 077-945-151-328-246; 084-022-394-011-890; 085-301-057-452-781; 101-488-954-100-242; 115-667-337-333-237; 125-603-866-998-533; 128-702-203-484-761; 175-559-937-727-879,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

Study,,2016,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Zareh Asatryan; Friedrich Heinemann; Mustafa Yeter; Eulalia Rubio; David Rinaldi; Fabian Zuleeg,"[This document was requested by the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control. It designated Mr Brian Hayes (MEP) to follow the study.] - The recent European crisis has put the issue of government efficiency high on national policy agendas. Policy measures that result in a reduction of bureaucratic slack or red tape can alleviate the trade-off between consolidation and public service provision. Since 2007 the role of the EU budget in support of administrative reforms has been strengthening, at least in formal terms. However, the extent to which the various EU budgetary instruments have encouraged public administration reforms is unclear. Against the background of the overall European approach towards public administration reforms, this study reviews the current budgetary instruments that directly or indirectly support such reforms, and analyses the coherence, EU added value and complementarities within them. Case studies on four Member States and an analysis of current networks and award initiatives to disseminate best practices complete the study. Based on extensive desk research and a set of semi-structured interviews, the analysis finds a positive but modest impact of the EU budget and existing networks on reform activity. Some of the key recommendations are to improve the consistency of Country Specific Recommendations related to administrative reforms, increase the effectiveness of the Structural Reform Support Programme, and to ensure coherence and complementarity between all EU-funded interventions as well as their monitoring and evaluation processes. As to the role of learning and policy-diffusion, the study recommends to promote focused peer-to-peer exchange among public sector managers, and to develop a more credible evaluation of public sector awards.",,,,,Public sector; Political science; Best practice; Consolidation (business); Public service; Monitoring and evaluation; National Policy; Public administration; Bureaucracy; Added value,,,,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/147039/1/869811940.pdf https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/147039,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/147039,,,2567216625,,0,,1,false,,

Hearn; Michael K. McLendon; Kristen C. Linthicum,"Since the 1980s, the U.S. states have adopted numerous new postsecondary-education policies, spanning the range from student-directed initiatives in merit scholarships and college-savings plans to institution-focused initiatives in performance-based funding and targeted researcher recruitment. In recent years, higher-education researchers have begun aggressively examining not only the effects of these new policies but also their origins in the fifty states. This essay reviews earlier research on policy adoption in political science, sociology, and other fields, then presents a conceptual framework for understanding and investigating the contextual factors driving state actions in the higher-education arena. The framework identifies four major domains of influence: a state’s socioeconomic context, organizational and policy context, politico-institutional context, and policy diffusion context. Research literature on these influences is reviewed, with special attention to developing theoretical propositions regarding the influences of specific factors under particular contextual conditions. The essay reviews emerging developments in policy-adoption scholarship in varied disciplines, then closes with a discussion of promising areas for future higher-education adoption scholarship.",,,309,354,Public economics; Conceptual framework; Business; Socioeconomic status; State (polity); Scholarship; Context (language use); State policy; Corporate governance; Public relations; Politics,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-48983-4_7 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-48983-4_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48983-4_7,,10.1007/978-3-319-48983-4_7,2586187458,,0,000-581-767-408-764; 001-328-701-270-077; 001-536-122-650-661; 003-191-454-928-887; 003-828-255-676-053; 005-520-678-989-993; 005-805-134-751-409; 007-528-105-852-200; 009-237-183-835-425; 011-799-061-141-544; 011-912-201-845-650; 012-349-897-513-991; 012-854-248-670-513; 013-107-846-399-812; 013-126-282-071-945; 014-442-426-465-339; 014-694-012-786-985; 015-082-877-604-035; 015-591-021-271-179; 015-868-062-417-989; 016-419-399-740-864; 017-640-435-417-028; 018-756-423-156-220; 019-123-720-228-776; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-046-597-557-636; 020-180-195-011-961; 021-955-379-114-065; 022-067-585-847-498; 022-438-656-847-250; 022-512-643-506-628; 023-831-104-510-956; 025-606-721-467-617; 027-491-840-440-412; 027-827-119-143-849; 028-730-064-064-304; 031-835-684-578-874; 032-069-438-163-995; 032-164-929-841-901; 032-288-512-921-839; 032-617-153-708-271; 033-575-910-404-667; 034-345-902-403-851; 035-316-359-878-532; 036-016-008-284-697; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-069-728-696-45X; 037-071-534-198-500; 037-454-954-385-28X; 037-692-427-359-198; 037-889-212-748-478; 038-362-560-254-031; 041-035-556-076-500; 042-246-305-978-880; 043-745-989-277-534; 044-014-360-377-076; 044-696-215-500-067; 045-314-342-324-684; 045-601-947-266-343; 046-454-797-196-907; 048-749-265-167-655; 050-032-739-608-330; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-950-951-032-538; 053-685-740-244-578; 054-869-936-785-176; 057-365-325-883-99X; 057-510-885-060-973; 058-584-207-510-275; 059-282-990-587-305; 059-744-102-244-624; 059-985-565-107-13X; 060-593-238-147-604; 060-912-247-648-705; 061-615-218-764-809; 062-222-159-195-376; 062-888-268-862-431; 063-212-074-039-179; 064-628-083-275-822; 064-814-171-153-461; 065-296-005-360-202; 065-622-907-025-017; 066-503-030-898-974; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-418-050-871-775; 068-722-495-786-908; 068-838-899-340-78X; 068-905-690-168-04X; 072-593-731-120-128; 073-378-430-919-643; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-667-154-035-429; 077-244-530-255-25X; 079-431-541-601-150; 081-115-377-382-511; 081-283-752-262-89X; 081-973-578-698-994; 083-081-184-392-123; 083-385-808-541-186; 083-757-786-570-975; 083-868-864-820-717; 084-787-681-556-687; 085-179-386-712-496; 085-595-191-358-012; 085-758-883-058-321; 086-379-564-939-11X; 090-491-862-134-111; 091-119-587-279-935; 091-963-542-755-516; 093-011-812-707-165; 096-362-816-439-456; 096-517-829-236-651; 096-548-920-809-272; 097-175-468-842-03X; 097-455-971-465-039; 097-760-110-271-962; 098-946-087-576-857; 099-289-651-450-964; 100-580-372-997-18X; 100-923-286-094-437; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-571-654-506-512; 102-490-342-063-275; 103-374-234-231-073; 103-525-327-644-681; 103-914-863-557-345; 104-328-969-702-904; 109-581-103-469-815; 111-759-980-707-405; 115-456-242-352-152; 115-482-499-323-938; 115-631-793-638-558; 115-996-579-461-546; 117-396-386-179-02X; 120-702-222-485-312; 121-553-769-349-058; 125-097-938-811-047; 126-118-776-074-625; 126-612-393-757-342; 128-770-104-804-197; 130-582-453-296-462; 134-300-624-191-268; 135-290-078-605-055; 137-296-967-426-356; 139-520-527-477-885; 140-903-698-141-79X; 142-556-354-049-593; 148-460-439-813-652; 152-255-523-905-607; 153-512-667-035-218; 155-580-858-393-517; 157-366-395-956-955; 157-580-964-400-074; 161-435-971-006-597; 162-004-951-093-883; 163-637-734-144-951; 165-940-893-224-267; 166-929-845-649-323; 168-930-942-678-119; 180-187-712-085-074; 182-895-633-966-180; 184-443-182-644-996; 189-917-633-904-27X,12,false,,

Through a mixed-method examination involving elite interviews, analyses of government pronouncements and regressions, and by drawing on concepts from rational choice theory, international policy diffusion, and rational design of international institutions, this study finds that the AIIB’s success with regard to its large membership is due to China’s effective creation of a demand for the organization among Western advanced economies. We argue that policymakers in Western countries enjoyed ‘induced agency’, which China granted them in the process of creating the organization and deciding about its membership. First, Western advanced economies had agency because their involvement was needed to prevent the AIIB from becoming a homogenous small organization consisting of Asian debtor countries in favour of a global organization with a heterogeneous group of both debtor and creditor country members. The AIIB was thus set up to accommodate the specific economic and political goals of Western advanced economies. Secondly, Western advanced economies experienced agency in the process of deciding about their membership in the bank because China proactively courted them to join the AIIB. China moreover endorsed the spontaneous intensification of communications that ensued among Western advanced economies with regard to joining the AIIB. Both efforts ultimately resulted in diffusion among them of the decision to become members. Thirdly, the Western advanced economies were granted agency in the process of determining the AIIB’s organizational design, thus allowing them to converge the initially diverse visions for the institutional design of the bank and shift it from contesting the existing system of multilateral development banks to effectively integrating into it. Our study thus advances a theory of country-specific demand for membership in an international organization.</jats:p>",12,3,333,370,Political economy; Investment banking; Political science; Multilateralism; Rest (physics),,,,"Vicerrectoría de Investigación de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Concurso Inicio 2017; Fondecyt Iniciación “The International Politics of China's Rising Role in Financing Infrastructure”; King's College London KURF",https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/12/3/333/5535694 http://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/12/3/333/5535694,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cjip/poz007,,10.1093/cjip/poz007,2963347295,,0,,24,true,,green

The main question the article explores is: How can we interpret the effort by advocacy groups in the United States to use the domestic political process to advance their international goals? The findings suggest that the literature on norm and policy diffusion as well as the structure of political opportunities and framing, both variables identified by social movement theorists, can help us understand the I-VAWA campaign and its strategies and achievements to date. The article interprets the policy process surrounding I-VAWA as an effort by rooted cosmopolitans to use favorable domestic political opportunities and strategic framing to diffuse international norms and standards.",11,2-3,175,193,Social movement; Political economy; Mobilization; Framing (social sciences); Political science; Law; Violence Against Women Act; Political process; Civil society; Domestic violence; Politics,,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468018111421415 http://gsp.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1177/1468018111421415 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1468018111421415,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1468018111421415,,10.1177/1468018111421415,2153707943,,0,009-895-462-786-456; 021-988-422-167-340; 022-415-575-040-875; 027-245-327-605-139; 032-929-209-988-704; 035-806-764-285-660; 035-869-138-267-623; 037-475-683-997-585; 037-794-552-831-313; 038-659-473-247-535; 042-781-810-415-194; 044-234-378-228-938; 044-753-284-324-413; 046-210-261-429-898; 049-233-755-826-94X; 051-606-887-814-765; 051-708-463-977-795; 052-191-771-991-959; 057-694-003-528-829; 061-886-962-368-104; 064-980-246-016-490; 070-937-693-897-246; 071-846-033-952-37X; 074-246-116-114-013; 080-582-994-167-231; 080-780-792-561-369; 081-069-471-541-887; 083-432-107-684-511; 085-636-013-973-918; 086-211-322-183-541; 092-452-066-789-548; 094-725-818-009-385; 096-765-292-366-642; 105-256-808-682-742; 105-323-669-875-698; 106-097-185-239-808; 107-459-024-373-274; 128-371-572-183-477; 166-396-593-002-638; 169-653-154-056-136; 183-145-944-844-598,5,false,,

Matisoff,"The question of what makes policies that provide a global public good more likely to be adopted by states is addressed by the paper's quantitative explanation of how states adopt climate change policies, which draws on policy innovation literature. The author starts by reviewing existing state climate change policy adoption empirical evidence. Next, several analytic approach derived policy adoption regional diffusion models and internal determinants that test specific hypotheses are presented. Testing of policy diffusion is done as a function of policy change obstacles, resources, and motivations. Environmental conditions and citizen demands are some policy innovation motivations. State geographic and financial resources, including wind and solar potential, are some resources. Obstacles includes reliance on coal, natural gas, and other carbon-intensive industries by states. That internal factors, citizens' demands in particular, are stronger state policy predictors than neighboring states diffusion effects, are shown in the results.",25,6,,,Public economics; Policy analysis; Climate change; Economics; Empirical evidence; Policy studies; State (polity); Global public good; Portfolio; Economic growth; Function (engineering),,,,,https://trid.trb.org/view/877147,https://trid.trb.org/view/877147,,,1551002151,,0,,6,false,,

New Environmental Policy Instruments (NEPIs) are becoming increasingly attractive. From a global perspective, there has been a rapid diffusion of these market-based, voluntary or informational instruments. This article examines the spread of four different NEPIs – eco-labels, energy or carbon taxes, national environmental policy plans or strategies for sustainable development, and free-access-of-information (FAI) provisions. The adoption of NEPIs by national policy makers is not simply a reaction to newly emerging environmental problems or to real or perceived deficits of traditional command and control regulation, rather the use of NEPIs can also be ascribed to the inner dynamics of international processes of policy transfer or policy diffusion. These processes make it increasingly difficult for national policy makers to ignore new approaches in environmental policy that have already been put into practice in ‘forerunner’ countries.",42,4,569,600,Public economics; Economics; Policy transfer; Command and control regulation; National Policy; Environmental policy; Sustainable development,,,,,https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/19983 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6765.00096 https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-6765.00096 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3971879 https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/bitstream/fub188/19983/1/rep_02-01.pdf http://edocs.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000001465/rep_02-01.pdf?hosts= http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000001465/rep_02-01.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.00096/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.00096,,10.1111/1475-6765.00096,1975719284,,0,003-888-377-522-663; 004-870-676-018-804; 008-414-059-072-131; 008-631-552-749-08X; 012-286-853-432-764; 012-562-267-270-940; 017-010-933-750-388; 018-090-368-264-553; 020-915-038-243-130; 026-412-549-797-331; 027-827-119-143-849; 028-304-400-289-974; 030-874-421-647-757; 034-712-785-236-397; 035-667-046-251-573; 037-151-489-751-943; 042-302-852-218-921; 043-117-570-987-791; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-846-133-812-979; 050-274-654-059-514; 052-664-251-354-144; 054-122-440-077-963; 054-439-782-058-709; 055-977-387-875-420; 057-523-166-966-640; 058-028-014-085-084; 059-069-738-713-784; 059-850-774-734-000; 065-735-236-805-08X; 073-270-682-356-889; 074-638-783-785-569; 074-796-221-935-91X; 079-806-590-019-499; 086-393-509-421-781; 092-858-750-165-82X; 094-387-586-690-669; 096-381-665-244-080; 096-517-829-236-651; 097-146-280-230-557; 099-956-410-004-10X; 101-127-387-013-017; 103-527-671-340-555; 114-553-592-542-069; 117-677-347-760-402; 119-921-324-820-905; 120-610-824-268-907; 120-806-223-883-108; 123-213-330-796-662; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-759-950-860-681; 127-635-007-579-401; 129-561-639-392-34X; 135-276-119-685-821; 137-496-379-784-09X; 141-735-814-884-686; 143-639-765-349-97X; 151-096-587-820-387; 154-907-385-529-562; 155-836-463-720-671; 162-203-696-105-745; 163-332-713-345-888; 163-637-734-144-951; 168-998-352-216-177; 170-463-010-432-030; 180-774-214-948-638; 181-523-798-859-793; 187-151-090-396-571; 189-166-557-037-711; 189-175-060-955-861; 198-443-377-032-875; 199-006-306-803-24X,216,true,,green

As of this writing, 177 countries have ratified the convention (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2018). However, little is known about whether the extent or features of national policies lead to greater identification and enrollment of children with disabilities (CWD) in formal schools. This study will describe one possible mechanism for the diffusion of public education for CWD through national or regional legislation for special education by countries participating in the CRPD (2006). The analysis will compare cross-country enrollment rates for CWD with prominent topical themes in country or regional legislation using structural topic modeling methods. Additionally, the analysis will examine correlations between enrollment rates, prominent topics, and meta-data (other relevant variables) identified as significant in the literature on policy diffusion. The data presented here may inform the special education field about the extent and effects of the global diffusion of education policies for CWD. The analysis may also extend world culture theory in sociology, detailing the use of international documents to influence policy language around the ideals of education for CWD.",,,,,Topic model; Political science; Legislation; Convention; Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; Special education; Public education; World culture; Economic growth; Identification (information),,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2gz6892t https://escholarship.org/content/qt2gz6892t/qt2gz6892t.pdf?t=q0nay6,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2gz6892t,,,2991613297,,0,004-536-539-839-581; 012-367-777-689-406; 012-691-963-065-167; 014-334-784-276-126; 016-309-834-158-071; 018-098-175-723-836; 023-251-587-347-91X; 027-827-119-143-849; 035-947-215-354-749; 040-498-710-057-135; 048-256-079-784-777; 049-303-192-978-755; 052-505-932-834-575; 061-973-970-085-871; 062-757-035-678-887; 071-846-033-952-37X; 097-918-695-766-326; 102-996-980-906-765; 103-993-374-943-761; 104-293-146-800-290; 125-104-195-935-227; 152-737-928-549-77X; 162-928-474-025-748; 180-373-229-924-527,0,false,,

To answer the research question, I suggest two possible reasons for decoupling between policy and practice: the characteristics of normative pressure as “the weak enforcement mechanism of law” through the implementation stage and jurisdictions’ capacity to infuse the stories of success based on others’ use to their own day-to-day realities. In this article, I seek to reintroduce a seminal contribution of the early institutionalists by challenging the assumption that dimensions of adoption and implementation are synonymous or positively correlated. Empirical findings contribute to provide scholars and practitioners with a larger picture of policy diffusion and support the arguments by Nicholson-Crotty and Carley that policy learning takes place based on policymakers’ assessment of both “policy actions” and “outcomes” in previously adopting jurisdictions.",34,5,617,635,Positive economics; Sociology; Research question; Policy learning; Enforcement; Decoupling (cosmology); Mechanism (sociology); Public administration; Normative,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/revpol/v34y2017i5p617-635.html https://econpapers.repec.org/article/blarevpol/v_3a34_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a617-635.htm https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ropr.12241,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ropr.12241,,10.1111/ropr.12241,2610505104,,0,001-099-114-464-823; 001-328-701-270-077; 003-592-471-884-916; 005-361-422-699-663; 006-560-751-822-19X; 008-226-834-584-448; 008-359-079-785-535; 015-017-684-942-459; 015-271-876-692-523; 018-454-798-334-448; 021-820-432-690-769; 022-512-643-506-628; 023-672-511-213-267; 023-843-404-656-218; 027-835-981-532-333; 032-239-771-401-28X; 034-420-165-656-302; 035-761-736-000-238; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-889-212-748-478; 040-890-082-669-89X; 041-233-562-227-624; 042-083-382-402-275; 047-040-237-229-551; 048-084-385-775-90X; 051-929-972-417-840; 053-431-450-379-079; 053-580-247-638-329; 056-077-059-538-567; 058-071-798-060-611; 062-078-066-470-021; 063-040-467-994-945; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-520-409-489-478; 068-873-109-492-468; 070-439-295-045-214; 073-413-403-689-193; 086-165-750-083-550; 086-254-802-036-25X; 088-499-162-836-045; 091-418-207-458-457; 098-926-960-817-208; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-488-954-100-242; 104-009-776-791-869; 110-811-723-663-252; 115-482-499-323-938; 119-971-427-396-153; 131-900-393-723-959; 134-440-123-939-180; 136-265-890-879-315; 141-409-033-271-664; 146-245-242-077-685; 150-595-829-838-417; 153-328-363-305-936; 154-228-278-302-026; 155-404-075-763-064; 182-243-371-270-904,7,false,,

This paper considers the conditions that determine the effectiveness of compensation and reward mechanisms. The paper takes deductive and inductive approaches to addressing the question. A series of 11 hypotheses are derived from theories of institutional change, environmental policy diffusion, and the co-dependence between different types of policy instruments. Eight case studies, all of which were considered at regional workshops on compensation for environmental services, are reviewed in the latter part of the paper. The cases, from Latin America, Africa and Asia, cover a range of environmental services and policy contexts. Overall the results suggest the following conditions to be important in many of the cases: (1) market opportunities and localized scarcity for particular environmental services; (2) international environmental agreements, international organizations, and international networks; (3) government policies and public attitudes toward government environmental responsibility, security of individual and group property rights, and markets; and (4) the strength of the regulatory regime affecting the environment.",,,,,Public economics; Scarcity; Public policy; Government; Ecotourism; Latin Americans; Geography; The Conceptual Framework; Compensation (psychology); Ecosystem services; Environmental planning,,,,,http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Publications/files/workingpaper/WP0081-07.PDF https://ideas.repec.org/p/raf/wpaper/b14958.html,http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Publications/files/workingpaper/WP0081-07.PDF,,,1584787479,,0,006-221-553-317-671; 021-823-102-453-932; 033-274-938-485-279; 052-995-000-269-929; 053-360-822-867-386; 057-829-319-904-734; 061-808-011-206-667; 072-719-900-896-826; 074-204-400-773-512; 074-306-088-030-489; 076-705-279-782-684; 086-413-487-603-781; 090-186-227-927-808; 091-287-290-060-61X; 108-919-766-251-496; 115-462-367-993-27X; 137-913-046-149-359; 139-893-988-956-223; 145-614-251-541-173; 153-406-885-626-121; 173-976-889-869-796; 175-233-369-071-081; 182-157-110-791-903; 182-375-564-867-576; 190-787-604-173-466; 197-105-063-612-828,21,false,,

Miller,"It has long been recognised that interstate diffusion of policy innovations is comprised of distinct decisions including adoption, reinvention and amendment. Interstate influences are an important driver of these diffusion processes, but studies to date have not investigated the degree to which external influences vary across these decisions. We theorise that geographical peers will have the largest impact in adoption decisions; that ideological peers are an important source of policy information when states make decisions about “reinventing” innovations adopted by others; and that internal factors will drive the decision by a state to amend a policy. We test these expectations for renewable portfolio standards in the American states between 1996 and 2009. Results suggest that state policymakers emulate peers in adoption or policy design choices, and that internal influences have a stronger influence on amendment decisions than do external influences. These findings further our understanding of policy diffusion and state-by-state relations.",37,4,431,458,Public economics; Energy policy; Ideology; Economics; Renewable energy; State (polity); Test (assessment); Renewable portfolio standard; Portfolio; Policy design; Market economy,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/jnlpup/v37y2017i04p431-458_00.html https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-public-policy/article/adoption-reinvention-and-amendment-of-renewable-portfolio-standards-in-the-american-states/669E468097760934AE6D46A9457A66CA https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/669E468097760934AE6D46A9457A66CA/S0143814X15000379a.pdf/div-class-title-adoption-reinvention-and-amendment-of-renewable-portfolio-standards-in-the-american-states-div.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0143814x15000379,,10.1017/s0143814x15000379,2604868381,,0,000-799-101-295-89X; 001-481-906-279-295; 002-557-636-257-591; 003-592-471-884-916; 003-989-414-156-774; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-086-400-376-508; 007-413-555-491-051; 011-224-015-287-916; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-419-031-338-034; 023-236-082-357-690; 023-672-511-213-267; 025-397-315-915-367; 029-515-235-558-072; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-969-989-312-301; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 039-664-709-632-96X; 043-547-850-265-638; 044-958-408-877-837; 046-896-012-685-128; 047-385-352-717-976; 047-704-910-999-29X; 050-082-471-457-812; 051-671-924-313-531; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-668-244-624-560; 061-793-046-506-062; 064-463-299-403-755; 065-296-005-360-202; 065-661-698-376-559; 067-490-686-317-462; 073-166-408-788-371; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-523-855-589-09X; 078-130-244-158-871; 078-475-330-427-103; 079-089-312-064-709; 079-705-757-170-703; 081-652-697-451-014; 082-891-525-195-936; 084-787-681-556-687; 091-394-237-745-859; 095-470-782-204-713; 098-317-151-036-205; 101-127-387-013-017; 107-169-754-435-152; 109-723-950-284-919; 117-005-511-150-947; 121-656-974-147-713; 123-008-005-630-674; 128-412-145-076-659; 134-300-624-191-268; 135-210-605-672-143; 140-882-984-483-643; 142-927-872-720-578; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-637-734-144-951; 173-256-407-940-663; 184-097-701-119-060,37,false,,

This study assesses the factors that led more than 45 states to enact and some to later repeal Motion Picture Incentive programs, a collection of tax incentives aimed at facilitating job creation and economic diversification. We find program enactments were driven by rising unemployment and national but not bordering state imitation. Falling unemployment and national trends drove subsequent terminations, but in many states, their impact was overwhelmed by the influence of incentive spending, which greatly reduced termination likelihood. These results not only shed light on policy enactments and terminations in general, but also inform scholarship on state tax incentives and the role of competitive factors in their creation and repeal—or lack thereof.",45,1,85,108,Public policy; Economy; Labour economics; Economics; Diversification (marketing strategy); State (polity); Scholarship; Unemployment; Repeal; Incentive; Incentive program,,,,,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X16661819 https://apr.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/08/01/1532673X16661819.abstract https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X16661819 https://www.growkudos.com/publications/10.1177%25252F1532673x16661819/reader,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532673x16661819,,10.1177/1532673x16661819,2502152586,,0,000-563-690-406-875; 001-702-791-285-180; 006-819-619-889-290; 008-414-193-659-208; 008-487-233-701-114; 012-386-193-176-15X; 019-800-971-286-968; 020-344-837-159-65X; 028-587-610-993-532; 028-627-911-263-625; 029-515-235-558-072; 037-071-534-198-500; 037-306-656-996-774; 038-619-779-714-232; 038-646-593-478-677; 039-652-519-537-445; 041-725-071-599-504; 046-228-929-552-921; 046-435-142-640-946; 051-817-558-098-614; 054-088-972-264-667; 057-371-621-536-192; 058-071-798-060-611; 065-057-193-467-622; 068-133-906-326-872; 070-439-295-045-214; 070-697-288-298-987; 073-463-622-996-295; 074-579-191-745-531; 078-157-136-881-392; 080-829-579-259-085; 083-995-319-080-348; 084-035-180-533-354; 089-246-733-306-824; 090-616-494-043-385; 095-228-984-826-523; 095-654-680-130-465; 096-362-816-439-456; 097-350-581-373-365; 098-797-818-793-198; 098-837-693-612-894; 100-187-758-506-848; 113-720-938-418-161; 114-242-344-118-826; 118-051-957-199-44X; 132-665-924-035-602; 133-690-120-174-851; 135-566-125-452-894; 139-197-924-278-372; 140-927-511-792-901; 149-601-821-920-013; 154-314-204-508-516; 154-729-072-523-275; 163-076-040-775-567; 167-064-472-549-739; 174-768-369-809-642; 175-521-977-846-983; 176-130-119-715-758; 176-306-096-567-989; 178-161-154-094-357; 182-787-958-030-956,23,false,,

One of the strategies employed by the Nigerian government and some development partners towards solving this problem is the deployment of social protection instruments, such as Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs), which aim at stemming the tide of poverty and vulnerability. This study uses the secondary research method to examine the extent to which the Latin American CCT model influenced the design and operation of the Nigerian CCT programme. The policy diffusion model adopted for the study posits that the success of CCT programmes in Latin America has stimulated its extension to many developing countries outside the region. The findings from the review of selected literature explain the rationale for CCTs as short-term poverty reduction and long-term human capital development. Admittedly, a nexus exists between the Latin American and Nigerian strategies. Yet the study concludes that the Latin American model cannot adequately serve as a blueprint for the Nigeria strategy, given that underlying conditions in upper middle-income Latin American countries are clearly different from those present in low income or lower middle-income African countries like Nigeria. The study recommends urgent implementation of the National Social Protection Policy; a review of the current CCT programme in Nigeria every two years and extensive research into social protection strategies.",10,3,20,37,Government; Latin Americans; Political science; Poverty; Human capital; Social protection; Cash transfers; Conditional cash transfer; Development economics; Developing country,,,,,https://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/jpag/article/view/16142 https://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/jpag/article/download/16142/pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/mth/jpag88/v10y2020i3p20-37.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.5296/jpag.v10i3.16142,,10.5296/jpag.v10i3.16142,3042643156,,0,000-571-193-216-368; 003-385-208-991-130; 008-814-316-192-218; 010-525-484-651-269; 012-133-650-457-948; 021-847-699-284-874; 037-470-691-848-245; 046-565-060-742-91X; 047-929-383-206-450; 061-406-295-102-154; 064-645-768-353-699; 068-905-690-168-04X; 111-311-391-791-084; 113-259-812-031-647; 127-451-464-813-770; 142-847-113-114-091; 162-793-731-688-476,0,true,cc-by-nc,hybrid

Borrowing from the literature on policy diffusion and ‘smart strategies’ of small European Union member states, we argue that policy diffusion is fostered by structural and agency-related factors. We illustrate our theoretical ideas with a case study on the new Swiss policy on micropollutants in surface waters. Based on a rich set of documents and interviews with key actors, we show that the integration of Switzerland into formal and informal transnational networks fosters the diffusion of its micropollutants policy to other Rhine riparian countries. In addition, we analyse agency-related factors favouring policy diffusion in river basins, such as a country's pioneer role, its expertise, the fact that its policy is in line with general policy goals in other countries and the political acceptance of the policy at home. Our analysis suggests that policy diffusion can be an important phenomenon in integrated water resources management.

Prior scholarship has identified at least two types of information: information about policy and information about political viability. Few empirical approaches have been able to distinguish between these separate mechanisms. The authors argue that an analysis of policy proposals can untangle political information from policy-based information. They employ their strategy with data on the proposal of tax and expenditure limits (TELs) in the U.S. states since 1970 through direct democracy.

Between 2015 and 2017, Transbrasil project has studied the different modalities of regional and south-south diffusion in Latin America and the Caribbean of two Brazilian policy models: Rural Territory Development and public food purchase from family farming. The main hypothesis of the research is that the South-South diffusion process reveals an ""hybridization"" of several forms of policy internationalization and diffusion: i) the policy-transfers approach; ii) the transnational circulation of norms and standards through international organizations mediations; iii) the regionalization and regional integration, especially through civil society and social movements. Considering this hypothesis, the research focused in two processes: 1) the characterization of the policy models in Brazil and of the transferred policies in the recipient countries; 2) identification and profile characterization of the main vectors, intermediaries or brokers of the policy diffusion(Brazilian and recipient countries` policy makers, international organizations, social movements etc.);. The method has associated literature review, documentary research and interviews with policy makers, beneficiaries and mediators in Brazil and in the recipient countries. In total, 68 interviews were realized. The diffusion of the public food purchase model was studied in Colombia, Haiti and Paraguay; and the diffusion of di Rural territory development in Argentina, El Salvador and Uruguay.",,,13,32,Public policy; Agriculture; Social movement; Intermediary; Latin Americans; Political science; Regional integration; Economic growth; Civil society; Internationalization,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02848531 https://agritrop.cirad.fr/588677/ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02848531/document,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02848531,,,2892029434,,0,,0,false,,

Yet, recent data on global historical trends suggest a decoupling of counterterrorist legislation and actual terrorist acts. Furthermore, previous studies of state policies demonstrate that actors often adopt policies for a variety of reasons, many of which are unrelated to the declarative purposes of these policies. In this article, I examine the factors that predict counterterrorist legislation.

Studlar; Kyle Christensen; Arnita Sitasari,"Various explanations have been advanced for the adoption of increasingly restrictive tobacco control policies in Western democracies, usually based on an examination of individual instruments. Some of the more popular explanations are socioeconomic modernization, interest group politics, political institutions, government ideology and vertical diffusion from the European Union (EU). This paper uses statistical models to test explanations of tobacco control policy across 15 EU member states adopting instruments of Comprehensive Tobacco Control Policy (CPTC) over two decades. Socioeconomic modernization, economic interest groups and domestic political factors all play a role in policy. Although there is declining influence of pro-tobacco domestic constituencies, adoption of CPTC is still inhibited by corporatist practices in member states. Vertical policy diffusion through the EU has aided domestic sources of policy adoption, making tobacco control policy one of multi-level governance and enhancing its comp...",18,5,728,745,Economic policy; Government; Ideology; Economics; Multi-level governance; Tobacco control; European union; Corporate governance; Economic growth; Modernization theory; Politics,,,,,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/tobacco-control-in-the-eu-15-the-role-of-member-states-and-the-eu https://csuepress.columbusstate.edu/bibliography_faculty/1173/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13501763.2011.586801 https://core.ac.uk/display/16429549 https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/44559/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2011.586801,,10.1080/13501763.2011.586801,2055838694,,0,000-219-747-237-37X; 003-096-072-557-990; 003-854-095-797-284; 003-986-246-703-439; 011-307-700-432-249; 013-425-743-132-107; 013-962-290-450-615; 015-586-660-721-969; 022-439-947-732-749; 030-716-612-544-343; 035-023-664-519-588; 042-294-263-574-808; 050-082-471-457-812; 053-580-247-638-329; 054-859-286-092-300; 056-997-970-093-762; 057-304-126-803-126; 060-807-154-411-376; 062-407-280-073-902; 063-958-962-471-147; 068-727-135-920-58X; 077-543-299-778-874; 083-111-814-428-480; 083-316-412-230-008; 083-721-218-551-907; 085-587-780-076-136; 090-851-705-915-260; 091-443-034-800-879; 098-795-275-508-362; 100-812-765-688-302; 100-887-382-061-509; 111-362-221-506-375; 112-104-103-895-79X; 117-677-347-760-402; 123-669-699-922-142; 126-268-774-772-546; 127-163-707-936-534; 132-367-016-376-967; 132-819-828-269-838; 138-970-336-907-821; 140-907-094-157-721; 155-682-962-752-601; 162-106-292-546-099; 170-536-303-929-061; 178-619-235-075-563; 180-913-031-410-269; 181-504-461-576-241,19,false,,
014-409-110-909-592,The Role of International Actors in Post-Communist Countries: Coercion or Persuasion? The Transfer of Hospital Design Standards by International Organizations and Private Firms,,2013,journal article,SSRN Electronic Journal,15565068,Elsevier BV,,Rodica Plugaru,"This paper explores the role of international actors in post-communist transformation. Taking the case of hospital design standards, it explains how the national actors choose to leave aside the national regulations and to adopt foreign technical standards. The paper analyzes the adoption of Western countries' standards for the modernization of healthcare facilities in Ukraine and Moldova. An in-depth comparative case study of two projects revealed that national architects of these post-soviet countries use foreign standards. While the change of standards is a similar outcome in both cases, the international actors involved are different. Our findings suggest that while both international organizations and private actors diffuse foreign technical standards in post-soviet countries, the processes is rather different. Whereas international organizations dispose of coercive means to impose foreign solutions, private actors need to negotiate and to convince for their adoption. Drawing on recent debates on policy diffusion and transfer (Dolowitz and Marsh 2012; 2000, Simmons and al. 2008, Stone 2010, 2012), the results shed light on “carriers” of institutional arrangements among different political systems.",,,,,Technical standard; Political science; Negotiation; Policy transfer; Post-Soviet states; Persuasion; Public administration; Public relations; Modernization theory; Foreign policy; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2335406 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01342315/document https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01342315,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2335406,,10.2139/ssrn.2335406,1483166355,,0,010-653-211-649-186; 024-917-741-911-086; 030-316-073-811-947; 032-101-402-703-029; 034-277-783-905-290; 080-285-338-290-10X; 087-913-025-484-244; 098-145-876-665-238; 117-677-347-760-402; 119-974-819-498-734; 122-351-093-261-822; 127-687-277-859-117; 157-373-094-218-751; 168-998-352-216-177; 183-871-842-546-190,0,true,,green

015-224-334-535-169,"Networks, Interest Groups and the Diffusion of State Policy",,2005,,,,,,Bradley Kile,"This dissertation identifies several key interest groups factors that influence the spread of state policies. Building on the work of Mintrom and Vergari (1998), Balla (2001), and Volden (2003) this dissertation examines the research question: if and how do the functions of interest groups influence the spread of policy in the states? I contend that policy assistance and stakeholder interest groups influence the spread of state policies through their activities that span interstate and intrastate policy networks. Given their incentives, functions, and resources these groups figure prominently in policy networks that encourage the exchange of substantive and procedural information that is needed for policies to spread from state to state. Through an examination of state prescription assistance programs and Medicaid preferred drug lists, the findings in this dissertation show strong support for my central argument. I analyze three distinct aspects of the spread of these state policies: initial innovation, diffusion and state-to-state emulation. I provide descriptive accounts of the initial state innovation of each of these policies. I also specify a series of quantitative models that examine policy diffusion and state-to-state emulation. Additionally, I conduct four case studies on states that were among the first to adopt preferred drug lists. I find consistent results across the two different policies to support my central argument. They confirm the first element of my research question regarding if these groups affect state policy choices. This is shown for both policies across a range of model specifications. More importantly, the results provide insight into the second element of my research question on how and why these groups contribute to the spread of state policies. The findings show that interest groups provide several specific mechanisms that contribute to the spread of policies. These include: committee participation, in-state resources, connectedness between state and national groups, and information exchanges. Each of these is tied to bringing key political actors and relevant policy information together.",,,,,Public economics; Political science; Element (criminal law); Stakeholder; Social connectedness; State (polity); Research question; Incentive; Argument; Politics,,,,,https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu%3A181475/ http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu%3A181475/datastream/PDF/view,https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu%3A181475/,,,1581394879,,0,002-496-157-515-614; 005-261-328-376-894; 014-694-012-786-985; 019-456-406-334-322; 032-058-085-018-464; 032-164-929-841-901; 036-533-341-050-806; 036-961-749-635-681; 041-354-911-142-516; 046-841-674-135-16X; 055-084-378-794-022; 068-905-690-168-04X; 070-439-295-045-214; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 078-022-923-823-185; 082-607-767-711-613; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-787-681-556-687; 095-179-619-530-275; 096-517-829-236-651; 101-127-387-013-017; 106-340-421-964-487; 106-352-974-752-749; 148-460-439-813-652; 162-037-061-299-59X; 163-637-734-144-951; 166-853-885-938-703; 183-331-587-329-801,4,false,,

Hayward; Lisa McKay-Brown; Shiralee Poed,"Positive behaviour support features prominently in Australian state and federal disability policy, and with the move to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), and the continuing role of the states in safeguarding the rights of people with disabilities, the representation of positive behaviour support in Australian policy is an important consideration. Extending a recent review of Australian state positive behaviour support policies, this study examined the NDIS quality and safeguarding framework. Using the concept of policy diffusion, the subject of restrictive practices was used to argue the risks associated with the representation of positive behaviour support in current Australian disability policy. This examination revealed that while positive behaviour support is aligned to the founding principles of the NDIS, it is represented inaccurately in NDIS policy. Further, policies for positive behaviour support are predominantly aligned to restrictive practices and contain inaccurate definitions of positive behaviour support. There is support for imitation and coercion in the diffusion (or “spread”) of positive behaviour support policy in Australia, and the potential ramifications for jurisdictions implementing positive behaviour support policy without considering the accuracy of how positive behaviour support is presented is discussed.",6,1,14,23,Public economics; Imitation; Political science; Coercion; Disability insurance; State (polity); Safeguarding; Quality (business); National Disability Insurance Scheme; Intellectual disability,,,,Australian Government Research Training Program,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:f90cc08 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/217290 https://eprints.qut.edu.au/180807/ https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1353316-positive-behaviour-support-in-australian-disability-policy--and-its-future-with-the-national-disability-insurance-scheme-(ndis) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23297018.2018.1498299,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23297018.2018.1498299,,10.1080/23297018.2018.1498299,2899273916,,0,008-782-644-787-137; 015-550-295-451-053; 016-490-317-926-449; 020-873-677-725-74X; 024-646-154-919-436; 027-679-879-505-636; 028-631-022-362-14X; 036-043-167-950-232; 043-571-831-474-899; 054-281-914-296-972; 058-071-798-060-611; 061-257-431-794-348; 064-086-346-831-189; 065-090-457-029-55X; 068-788-090-286-990; 069-181-260-108-931; 071-830-090-301-091; 072-680-645-890-463; 075-037-345-190-277; 076-726-538-933-866; 077-382-599-941-368; 080-387-585-879-242; 081-911-460-684-868; 085-773-609-143-430; 092-015-741-248-863; 094-617-249-231-649; 096-548-920-809-272; 100-883-175-287-056; 101-488-954-100-242; 101-607-543-966-18X; 109-310-925-450-078; 113-497-637-716-30X; 113-855-077-861-644; 125-350-500-334-000; 138-461-711-617-178; 147-707-183-780-492; 172-498-624-488-736,13,true,,green

It compares these dynamics across state systems in which policy-makers possess different capabilities to learn about policy effectiveness: independent decision-makers focusing on own experiences vs. interdependent social learners relying heavily on experiences of others. The simulation can thus compare policy adoption patterns in the presence and absence of policy diffusion within a controlled setting. The simulation makes two propositions. First, it supports the existing critique that relying on the identification of policy clusters can lead researchers to draw false positive conclusions about the relevance of policy diffusion. Second, it suggests that relying on the identification of policy volatility under political stability minimizes this risk.",28,3,497,519,Diffusion (business); Economics; Microeconomics; Interdependence; Policy learning; Policy effectiveness; Political stability; Identification (information); Relevance (information retrieval); Volatility (finance),,,,,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0951629815581461 https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43280/ https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:sae:jothpo:v:28:y:2016:i:3:p:497-519 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0951629815581461 https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/jothpo/v28y2016i3p497-519.html https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0951629815581461,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0951629815581461,,10.1177/0951629815581461,2329377319,,0,000-306-971-296-759; 001-328-701-270-077; 004-571-652-977-461; 009-262-250-879-394; 009-706-654-627-85X; 014-998-066-812-811; 025-112-618-417-304; 033-852-625-704-380; 033-969-989-312-301; 036-316-736-908-394; 039-515-181-628-508; 052-723-818-069-06X; 057-533-967-339-814; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-544-147-171-119; 061-373-779-540-021; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 081-483-722-328-380; 083-128-427-871-272; 089-887-822-501-170; 098-353-841-797-309; 103-434-978-588-077; 117-159-670-092-782; 118-513-543-976-791; 125-268-617-755-543; 128-955-543-483-090; 138-952-173-018-704; 145-428-474-771-751; 186-816-093-779-065,3,true,,green

From 2010 to 2013, 42 projects (145 cases, 88,899 million won) were implemented by 14 affiliated organizations under Gyeongsangnam Provincial Government. The number of projects and budget size has been decreased over 4 years, besides most of main projects were continued. The budgets were largely used for wetland project of cities and counties. Development and implementation of various conservation projects may have considerable potential values in wetland conservation, while it is still difficult to assess their overall effectiveness in the society. Diverse wetland management practices in Gyeongsangnam Provincial Government have accumulated fundamental practices and knowledge for an effective local conservation. These administrative experiences will further benefit other local government to establish wetland management framework. To accelerate policy diffusion to other local governments, Gyeongsangnam Province needs to promote and share leading experiences and information of wetland conservation.

I tackle this puzzle by investigating the domestic effects of health cooperation among South American states within the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). The article shows how the establishment of a regional sector‐based institution like the Health Council of UNASUR triggered the diffusion of similar policies by reducing transaction costs and increasing information exchanges among member states’ health bureaucracies. I argue that RIOs such as UNASUR catalyse transnational diffusion not by enforcing binding regional norms (as in the case of the EU), but by bridging member states’ shared functional needs and asymmetric capacities in specific policy areas. Using the case of UNASUR Health, the article contributes to the study of the logics of transnational diffusion within RIOs in the absence of authority delegated to supranational institutions.",57,5,1111,1129,Public health; Political science; Institution; South american; Member states; Public administration; Bureaucracy; Transaction cost,,,,Agencia Estatal de Investigación,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3605710 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcms.12875,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jcms.12875,,10.1111/jcms.12875,2944522729,,0,003-412-189-797-295; 003-628-352-044-22X; 006-318-652-286-576; 006-722-686-316-360; 009-279-368-670-036; 010-374-721-508-285; 014-264-098-424-407; 018-406-238-094-822; 022-058-909-319-436; 022-439-947-732-749; 028-165-387-722-560; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-755-195-934-817; 038-590-453-841-868; 052-664-251-354-144; 055-550-576-431-615; 067-632-966-430-022; 068-873-109-492-468; 074-639-502-628-239; 077-926-704-396-107; 085-763-201-625-883; 087-539-673-928-897; 089-760-770-544-065; 103-802-164-732-742; 112-471-389-299-022; 113-741-307-551-153; 117-677-347-760-402; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-714-462-443-222; 134-972-281-524-877; 141-735-814-884-686; 150-153-011-261-553; 155-180-161-631-72X; 187-002-189-107-38X,13,false,,

Interestingly, both disciplines have approached the subject from opposite starting points and with differing methodologies. Whereas in the field of international studies theoretically derived expectations of an increasing similarity of states and political systems driven by economic or ideational forces constituted a dominant thread in the early convergence literature (for a comprehensive overview see Drezner 2001), comparative studies initially focused more on the explanation of empirically observed differences between national political systems and programmes (Lundqvist 1974, 1980). Only recently have the two research strands effectively merged into an integrated study of policy convergence that increasingly challenges the traditional boundaries between comparative politics and international relations. In this chapter we first introduce the concept of policy convergence and explain how it relates to similar concepts like policy transfer, policy diffusion or isomorphism. In a second step we review the existing empirical research on environmental policy convergence both in comparative politics and in international relations. Based on this overview, and drawing more broadly on the general convergence literature, we systematise the major causes of policy convergence that have been identified in these studies. We distinguish between causal mechanisms which translate pressures at the international level into domestic policy change and, possibly, into convergence of domestic policies, and facilitating factors which operate at the level of individual countries or specific policies.",,,7,29,Public economics; Positive economics; Empirical research; Political science; Regulatory competition; Policy transfer; Domestic policy; International relations; International studies; Economic integration; Comparative politics,,,,,https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/123456789/4127/1/State_of_the_art_2008.pdf https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/environmental-policy-convergence-in-europe/state-of-the-art-conceptualising-environmental-policy-convergence/6316A9473C0EBD8FA3D0BA1A88A4310B https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/4127,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511491962.003,,10.1017/cbo9780511491962.003,1532517745,,0,,8,true,,green

This paper asks whether, in the presence of direct democratic institutions, spatial interactions additionally result from voters’ direct actions. The proposed mechanism is that the voters’ actions in vetoing a decision or inaugurating a preferred policy by a binding initiative in their jurisdiction can potentially have spillover effects on the actions of voters and special interest groups of neighboring jurisdictions. Utilizing data on around 1,800 voter-petitions across over 12,000 German municipalities in 2002-09, we find that a jurisdiction’s probability of hosting a petition is positively driven by the neighbors’ direct democratic activity. These effects are persistent, and are stronger for more visible instruments of direct democracy. The interactions are also mostly driven by petitions in same or similiar policy areas, and are stronger in towns with relatively more per capita newspapers.",,,,,Public economics; Special Interest Group; Per capita; Economics; Jurisdiction; Competition (economics); Direct democracy; Spillover effect; Democracy; Yardstick,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2645766_code103978.pdf?abstractid=2645766&mirid=1 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2645766 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2645766,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2645766,,10.2139/ssrn.2645766,2278403157,,0,000-332-508-783-730; 004-687-267-237-736; 007-272-718-451-999; 007-748-315-099-75X; 008-360-532-112-426; 014-048-806-563-605; 016-449-027-336-198; 018-239-036-750-670; 019-762-799-324-525; 022-277-485-388-04X; 024-375-879-515-197; 026-347-764-859-330; 028-115-283-573-075; 028-607-359-686-860; 029-472-809-551-703; 033-969-989-312-301; 036-185-958-999-749; 038-713-027-959-756; 041-563-645-545-988; 042-781-810-415-194; 051-313-198-531-162; 051-535-985-970-061; 051-575-444-962-911; 052-161-893-707-920; 058-071-798-060-611; 060-979-637-414-361; 061-000-074-446-842; 068-492-211-931-851; 069-990-322-932-29X; 070-688-032-180-323; 073-753-993-648-180; 073-796-412-498-509; 082-975-149-188-350; 087-248-023-920-180; 094-784-413-670-714; 095-115-886-347-042; 102-949-081-922-794; 104-334-134-703-969; 106-883-133-351-273; 115-571-026-020-763; 115-739-569-469-301; 115-831-064-093-857; 119-070-441-662-907; 122-307-684-766-592; 127-807-528-981-832; 130-426-477-469-909; 133-068-634-776-681; 133-817-899-985-927; 139-126-485-113-227; 140-736-526-491-974; 141-605-677-048-925; 148-404-115-135-123; 153-791-479-320-358; 154-449-689-622-832; 156-860-707-271-11X; 157-003-040-712-991; 163-045-938-096-85X; 175-570-617-762-015; 187-299-443-538-039,1,true,,green

Using a large dyadic dataset on all Swedish municipalities from 2010, we find that senior public managers in local administrations learn from similar local governments and from neighbours.

As such, we know little about the mechanisms of diffusion for preemption of atypical policies such as animal regulations that lack a clear economic or ideological motivation. In this article, we propose and test a theory of conditional policy learning to explain the diffusion of atypical policies. We posit that a type of policy learning is occurring here, but that states only look to their neighbors when certain policy specific factors are present in their state. His theory is then applied to examine the dynamics of state adoption of laws preempting local Breed Specific Legislation from 1988 to 2014. Using an exponential model, two policy learning and two conditional learning hypotheses are tested. This study finds that policy learning is occurring through both external and internal pathways. This advances the literature by demonstrating that preemption occurs through the learning mechanism, but this learning effect is conditioned on policy relevant factors within the state.",8,2,223,247,Learning effect; Dynamics (music); Ideology; Economics; Law; Morality; Preemption; State (polity); Test (assessment); Mechanism (sociology),,,,,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/spp-2017-0009/html https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/statpp/v8y2017i2p223-247n1.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/spp-2017-0009,,10.1515/spp-2017-0009,2776090935,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 001-367-136-082-787; 001-481-906-279-295; 002-557-636-257-591; 005-692-270-875-15X; 005-891-817-200-87X; 012-286-853-432-764; 012-883-251-761-670; 015-591-021-271-179; 016-104-585-566-98X; 017-612-323-073-939; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-769-346-177-716; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-359-665-514-587; 021-891-810-943-240; 027-885-859-304-797; 030-828-508-168-524; 034-694-383-916-692; 034-885-191-890-792; 036-961-749-635-681; 050-082-471-457-812; 051-963-094-079-17X; 054-713-684-420-62X; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 063-040-467-994-945; 063-446-677-896-059; 066-943-284-979-976; 067-272-023-437-214; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-264-304-760-006; 068-350-390-447-112; 069-961-186-824-979; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-495-223-631-426; 077-945-151-328-246; 079-416-691-248-326; 079-431-541-601-150; 084-787-681-556-687; 088-919-425-365-248; 093-350-726-805-144; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-488-954-100-242; 102-490-342-063-275; 102-636-764-980-160; 113-720-938-418-161; 114-469-305-545-899; 136-145-499-631-53X; 137-674-676-505-121; 149-166-087-624-952; 159-149-967-294-101; 159-499-805-294-432; 186-994-947-508-464,0,false,,
017-854-494-850-618,"South-South Trade, Trade-Based Policy Diffusion, And Political Autonomy In Countries Of The Global South",2016-09-28,2016,,,,,,Jonas Gamso,"The tremendous growth of South-South trade is among the key trends in international economics, yet it has received surprisingly little attention from scholars of international political economy. This dissertation helps to fill this void by providing the first systematic analysis of the political effects of South-South trade. Such analysis is appropriate given the foreign policy norm that uniquely characterizes South-South relations, including South-South trade: countries of the South espouse the practice of non-interference in the domestic affairs of their partners. In contrast, countries of the North typically seek to promote certain domestic policies among their partners in the Global South, such as human rights, democratic governance, certain foreign policy behaviors, and labor and environmental standards. In light of Southern non-interference and its contrast to the foreign policy norms of countries of the North, this dissertation assesses the effects of South-South trade on trade-based diffusion processes associated with labor laws, environmental standards, and voting within international organizations. In assessing each of these policy areas, the analysis considers three issues: first, whether the policy diffusion patterns associated with South-South are different from those associated with other types of trade flows; second, whether high levels of South-South trade weaken the effectiveness of trade-based policy promotion efforts by countries of the North; and third, whether variation in South-South trade levels moderates the relationships between domestic political variables and policy outcomes. These hypotheses correspond to a novel theory positing that trade-based efforts by Northern countries to promote the adoption of their favored policies by partners in the South are weaker where those Southern partners engage in high levels of South-South trade. In Southern countries where Northern efforts are rendered weak by high levels of South-South trade, it is further theorized that domestic level interests and institutions play a larger role in the policy process, as these interests and institutions are less constrained by interference from the North and not subject to comparable interference efforts from the South. The results provide mixed support for this theory, but they do clarify that South-South trade is accompanied by different policy diffusion patterns than other types of trade.",,,,,Commercial policy; International trade; Economics; Human rights; Trade barrier; International political economy; Free trade; Autonomy; International free trade agreement; Foreign policy,,,,,http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/28011/,http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/28011/,,,2583107164,,0,003-643-599-976-059; 008-958-315-869-672; 010-625-463-331-440; 010-825-035-678-655; 011-695-405-799-790; 012-560-859-444-60X; 014-676-466-040-855; 015-609-332-814-954; 015-989-260-216-783; 017-052-671-903-852; 017-540-434-271-137; 019-597-065-254-445; 019-876-519-079-269; 019-925-530-984-997; 020-369-080-840-849; 020-839-389-618-043; 026-114-269-731-084; 028-806-149-834-476; 032-747-236-840-740; 035-155-591-360-004; 040-510-250-163-285; 044-436-736-492-268; 048-392-142-828-442; 049-340-324-916-111; 049-903-330-102-09X; 049-941-706-271-965; 052-201-386-466-679; 065-155-511-868-325; 065-825-112-138-675; 072-432-547-714-965; 072-666-354-794-980; 073-127-408-896-469; 073-197-710-013-616; 073-913-421-188-967; 074-367-036-973-759; 086-133-481-424-612; 089-120-862-703-646; 098-241-276-361-679; 100-216-348-370-095; 103-218-268-340-636; 104-221-472-585-327; 105-663-919-028-661; 108-470-980-317-567; 110-345-547-732-582; 110-436-523-263-439; 113-511-894-055-328; 116-922-384-383-781; 118-493-614-029-017; 123-893-910-829-020; 135-541-444-864-000; 141-209-429-395-499; 146-213-796-969-064; 149-620-499-530-781; 159-394-964-959-832; 163-165-487-559-048; 171-908-234-524-941; 180-420-059-500-703; 194-320-184-946-229; 198-986-578-139-469,1,false,,

The state has set an ambitious goal of reducing GHG to 1990 levels by 2020 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The statewide goal cannot be accomplished without the support of local stakeholders. We analyzed over 150 city climate action plans (CAPs) in California and examined their reduction goals. We hypothesized five sets of factors that can explain whether a jurisdiction adopts a plan or not, and what kind of target it sets. We find that size of the city, political ideology, and institutional capacity are related to a higher chance of adopting a climate action plan, while political ideology and air quality explain the extent of aspiration of targets. We also find evidence of policy diffusion where neighbors are more likely to adopt plans. Our findings identify gaps in the CAPs within the state and address what lessons can be learned from the Californian experience of local climate policy adoption and goal-setting.",155,4,489,509,Public economics; Global Leadership; Business; Ideology; Think globally  act locally; Jurisdiction; Action (philosophy); Action plan; Greenhouse gas; Politics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/climat/v155y2019i4d10.1007_s10584-019-02505-7.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-019-02505-7 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6666678 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10584-019-02505-7.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ClCh..155..489H/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02505-7,,10.1007/s10584-019-02505-7,2969006097,,0,000-210-391-570-954; 000-585-835-344-247; 002-287-457-528-766; 004-915-110-709-231; 005-310-646-050-791; 006-844-354-722-026; 015-475-716-108-652; 016-051-857-447-671; 017-326-861-972-029; 017-893-478-842-222; 018-564-654-924-067; 030-873-589-968-357; 032-741-205-895-872; 037-498-702-875-594; 037-649-150-952-373; 045-669-420-834-130; 046-631-390-868-913; 047-385-352-717-976; 051-929-721-129-019; 053-241-506-533-390; 057-687-365-961-341; 057-746-241-669-397; 062-475-092-624-150; 064-067-573-053-977; 074-478-970-665-634; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-764-925-955-292; 079-705-757-170-703; 088-919-425-365-248; 090-439-868-235-126; 094-833-112-635-235; 095-179-619-530-275; 095-372-879-668-240; 096-548-920-809-272; 102-060-536-407-216; 102-100-656-334-043; 116-346-116-269-437; 117-005-511-150-947; 129-378-404-150-076; 139-444-636-777-770; 142-832-089-751-207; 150-154-354-031-631; 150-591-175-535-709; 165-234-382-766-111; 182-750-836-059-807,8,true,,green

So defined, diffusion is both an old and a new phenomenon. It is old because interdependencies have always existed. The famous “Galton’s problem”, which points to the importance of interdependencies and the analytical problems following inaccurate assumptions about the independence of cases, was formulated in 1889 when Sir Francis Galton discussed a paper by Edward Tylor, a fellow anthropologist (Ross/Homer 1976: 1–2). Tylor showed a correlation between marriage laws and descent patterns, but Galton retorted that the analysis neglected the possibility of cultural diffusion among tribes. From then on, “Galton’s problem” has been discussed in all textbooks on the comparative method, though the issue has usually been neglected in empirical work.",38,,39,55,Public economics; Positive economics; Sociology; Interdependence; Independence (mathematical logic); Unum; Diffusion theory; Pluribus; Phenomenon; Galton's problem; Comparative method,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/18143476 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-531-90612-6_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-531-90612-6_2 https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_2E4096EFC77F https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-531-90612-6_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-531-90612-6_2,,10.1007/978-3-531-90612-6_2,96573956,,0,001-916-985-921-10X; 003-489-035-431-624; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-553-153-856-945; 005-692-270-875-15X; 005-870-460-643-930; 006-722-686-316-360; 008-414-059-072-131; 011-497-790-292-357; 014-693-371-709-274; 014-856-181-158-225; 016-634-173-735-220; 017-170-773-275-495; 018-853-705-736-666; 027-463-820-450-228; 027-952-834-053-159; 033-852-625-704-380; 034-556-790-368-077; 035-261-961-935-32X; 038-818-459-512-182; 039-547-330-572-082; 041-659-281-349-623; 047-812-993-541-791; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-227-174-646-062; 050-671-315-820-339; 052-846-321-460-629; 052-998-446-931-087; 057-165-728-487-522; 057-533-967-339-814; 061-308-647-817-198; 061-373-779-540-021; 063-149-938-949-77X; 065-296-005-360-202; 067-121-006-432-261; 067-547-536-056-505; 069-673-735-885-795; 070-365-824-959-398; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 078-720-122-108-155; 079-577-182-637-187; 081-231-253-156-502; 083-099-894-950-017; 083-629-464-861-706; 088-993-237-313-315; 091-729-566-642-692; 091-736-584-918-934; 092-645-591-040-210; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-567-154-825-257; 094-833-126-001-305; 097-419-955-788-796; 104-708-305-961-254; 108-166-013-954-847; 112-333-966-495-520; 118-513-543-976-791; 121-587-222-469-238; 123-492-128-061-384; 125-627-479-962-553; 126-062-812-255-686; 126-219-645-947-097; 128-150-266-973-359; 131-076-765-815-326; 131-502-649-538-682; 133-087-716-464-773; 139-186-190-548-754; 146-420-813-412-877; 148-223-435-969-407; 155-580-858-393-517; 159-487-777-201-973; 163-637-734-144-951; 170-851-664-310-256,21,false,,

Mooney; Mei-Hsien Lee,"The social learning theory of policy decisionmaking provides clear expectations for the temporal diffusion of policy through the American states (Gray, 1973; Rogers, 1995; Walker, 1969). But the diffusion of morality policy, with its technical simplicity, potential for high salience, and debate over basic moral values, may be driven by nonroutine decisionmaking. We hypothesize that morality policy will diffuse in patterns that depend on the purity of the morality debate surrounding it and the distribution of citizen values regarding it. We identify three distinctive temporal diffusion patterns for state death penalty policies that vary on these characteristics. We conclude that political decisionmaking driving some morality policy diffusion involves less policy learning, and more concern about majority public opinion, than does nonmorality policy.",27,4,766,780,Positive economics; Gray (horse); Public opinion; Social learning theory; Economics; Salience (language); Morality; Legislation; Policy learning; Public administration; Politics,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1541-0072.1999.tb02002.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.1999.tb02002.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0072.1999.tb02002.x,,10.1111/j.1541-0072.1999.tb02002.x,1971733230,,0,006-106-338-978-676; 008-809-979-742-501; 014-179-574-201-284; 017-277-944-387-775; 018-391-579-961-024; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-046-597-557-636; 022-376-850-088-250; 029-090-213-156-370; 031-762-133-647-285; 036-961-749-635-681; 053-697-549-206-862; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-246-795-278-536; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-544-962-568-939; 084-787-681-556-687; 087-128-370-385-200; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-445-765-900-11X; 102-089-371-453-36X; 102-797-199-716-865; 134-300-624-191-268; 183-079-321-581-821,74,false,,

Policy diffusion and the analysis of policy diffusion is less developed in public procurement than other policy areas such as investment. This is surprising given the potential economic (public procurement accounts for some 8% of GDP) and signaling (transparency, good governance) gains of adopting regimes that promote competition in public procurement markets. The article first provides an introduction to the issue of public procurement and discusses the nature of procurement regimes, the dependent variable. It then assesses the impact of key variables identified in the literature on policy diffusion, such as competition, coercion and norm emulation. It is argued that issue linkage in bilateral free trade agreements (FTA) appears to have brought about common laws – and in some cases – rules for procurement. But this stops short of a genuine diffusion of liberal procurement regimes due to negotiations being framed by reciprocity rather than efficiency considerations, the costs and complexity of implementation, as well as opposition from vested sector interests and politicians at all levels of government favoring the short term political utility of ‘buy local’ policies.",18,1,153,173,Business; Common law; International economics; Law; Negotiation; Procurement; Transparency (market); Good governance; International relations; Free trade; Politics,,,,,https://brill.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718069-12341248 http://collections.unu.edu/view/UNU:19 https://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15718069-12341248 https://brill.com/view/journals/iner/18/1/article-p153_9.xml?language=en http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/45089/ https://core.ac.uk/display/16378586,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15718069-12341248,,10.1163/15718069-12341248,2028192764,,0,016-437-932-740-045; 022-614-922-748-299; 041-013-108-678-586; 044-443-867-264-586; 078-716-543-061-349; 113-577-836-606-488; 132-598-100-075-655; 178-074-689-374-843,5,false,,
019-425-396-200-82X,"Catching recurring waves: low-emission vehicles, international policy developments and firm innovation strategies",,2015,journal article,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,00401625,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,René Bohnsack; Ans Kolk; Jonatan Pinkse,"Low-emission vehicle (LEV) technologies have grown in the 1990s, but have since experienced fluctuating interest. Initially, electric vehicles (EVs) were the most promising technology. Most large car firms developed EVs and started bringing them to the market, in limited numbers. Yet, car firms halted their EV engagement around 2001 and focused on hybrid vehicles (HVs) and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) instead. Hybrids found their way into the product portfolios of most car manufacturers while FCVs failed to gain traction. In 2006, car firms again committed to EVs, and on a larger scale. To better understand recurring waves of firms' low-emission-vehicle investments in the international context, this paper explores the influence of geographically-bound government policies on car firms' innovation strategies. An analysis of archival data from 1997 to 2010 details LEV-specific developments per region/firm, and shows the complex interplay between policies on local, national and international levels and firms' strategies. Three mechanisms seem to shape the international LEV trajectory: (1) international policy diffusion (vertically and horizontally), (2) firms' international operations, and (3) fit between policy requirements and firm capabilities. Heeding the call for a better geographical conceptualization of technological trajectories, this paper also proposes a framework that explains co-evolution between government policies and car manufacturers.",98,,71,87,Public policy; Product (category theory); Business; Archival research; Context (language use); International policy; Industrial organization; Scale (social sciences); Conceptualization; Low emission vehicle,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162515001870 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162515001870 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2Fe9e7fd33-ff03-4f59-9940-41e46aefd02b https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/catching-recurring-waves-lowemission-vehicles-international-policy-developments-and-firm-innovation-strategies(804f53c0-1da2-4f2f-b74c-2d49453fe6ca).html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2015.06.020,,10.1016/j.techfore.2015.06.020,3125791390,,0,003-665-299-702-184; 007-252-692-282-120; 011-120-134-686-665; 011-405-987-400-605; 014-565-458-214-323; 014-676-526-941-090; 018-005-600-123-482; 018-389-581-226-317; 021-912-959-958-029; 022-840-598-070-724; 024-822-857-448-714; 030-455-471-029-870; 031-742-676-096-119; 032-693-590-042-900; 033-207-926-341-219; 035-191-524-623-140; 036-332-253-976-202; 036-667-426-743-699; 037-652-049-180-521; 038-416-744-553-15X; 039-093-420-750-379; 041-181-464-222-270; 043-710-231-324-325; 044-923-928-642-433; 046-423-306-011-102; 049-633-934-271-591; 052-388-319-499-334; 053-137-472-464-664; 055-498-815-134-39X; 055-737-049-590-665; 056-534-655-631-902; 057-182-468-997-853; 058-704-179-299-946; 060-345-661-272-418; 063-902-776-591-679; 066-386-058-671-00X; 068-259-085-977-283; 073-738-522-118-065; 076-167-501-725-205; 077-292-393-742-057; 083-299-619-649-998; 091-995-630-606-656; 092-163-899-683-456; 092-479-510-914-502; 095-710-146-832-751; 096-459-480-602-643; 097-384-305-139-56X; 097-976-002-469-130; 101-488-954-100-242; 103-604-640-927-157; 106-273-824-099-072; 107-294-051-396-217; 107-576-197-990-492; 112-055-437-121-577; 118-744-442-104-415; 119-377-622-634-223; 130-195-131-839-129; 137-102-326-384-557; 138-162-263-123-536; 139-294-758-670-241; 142-900-356-516-685; 146-213-796-969-064; 151-097-054-357-603; 155-928-712-185-306; 167-228-154-453-684; 167-375-557-062-231; 168-447-756-690-229; 175-346-222-996-857; 184-252-850-555-779,18,true,,green

Cities, in particular, stand out as an essential governing unit with huge potentials in resolving some of the 21st century’s most pressing concerns. The recent explosion of the phenomenon of city-networks reflects intensifying city-to-city interactions in addressing global environmental issues. This article examines the case of Tokyo in addressing challenges posed by climate change. Examining the origin, development, and diffusion of Tokyo’s climate change policy, the cap-and-trade scheme was found to have first diffused from Europe to Tokyo, adjusted to adapt to the local context, then further diffused to other Asian cities. Study of Tokyo’s experience demonstrates that policy formation does not always follow a centralized, top-down, command-and-control approach. This findings challenge conventional realist conception which emphasises the dominance of central authorities and sovereign states in global policy formation. Under the framework of global governance, this article argues that cities are important sites of policy experimentation and innovation, and that the case of Tokyo demonstrates the potential of cross-country policy diffusion.</jats:p>",9,2,61,74,Diffusion (business); Political science; Economic geography; International policy,,,,,https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/bjes-2019-0014 https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/bjes/9/2/article-p61.pdf https://sciendo.com/article/10.1515/bjes-2019-0014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bjes-2019-0014,,10.1515/bjes-2019-0014,2983003818,,0,003-996-395-946-302; 013-922-173-129-113; 041-041-574-032-967; 074-326-870-021-548; 094-833-112-635-235; 097-616-577-895-393,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

Sixty innovative Swedish policies are compared in detail with Finnish policies introduced later. One-fourth of these cases display more or less identical policies in the two countries. Half of these cases of 'probable diffusion' are then subjected to detailed case study analysis. It turns out that the similarities are indeed results of diffusion from Sweden to Finland, i.e. involve a conscious introduction of Swedish modeis into Finnish politics. No one pattern of diffusion can be observed, but the author suggests that there are four typical kinds of diffusion: political, bureaucratic, corporative and cumulative. In a discussion of implications for further research the author stresses that more attention should be paid to purely domestic factors in the study of Nordic relations.

Rubado,"In recent decades local governments have begun cooperating more frequently, hurdling collective action problems and countering their traditionally competitive relationships to seek common ends. Scholars of local governance have studied how and why these collaborations emerge. However, a significant gap in the literature exists regarding how these collaborations have increased over time. This research project proposes to examine this question through a quantitative analysis of local-level budget data over a 35 year period, and posits that mechanisms of policy diffusion (including emulation, learning, and competition among localities) are central to explaining this phenomenon. I suggest that as some localities experiment with cooperative agreements and succeed, leaders in other localities take note, learn from successful cooperation, and begin their own collaborative experiments. The model tests whether the density of cooperative municipalities in an area increases the likelihood of other localities in the same area cooperating.",,,,,Regional science; Political science; Quantitative analysis (finance); Collective action; Cooperative Agreements; Local governance; National study; Public relations; Phenomenon,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2455016_code2096824.pdf?abstractid=2455016&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2455016,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2455016,,,2402633743,,0,,1,false,,

The powerful actors and dynamics of policy making process in Turkey and their influence have been examined. The research analyzed how Turkey's policies against drugs have been in line with the world and European drug policies especially UNODC and EMCDDA.  Due to the transnational nature of drugs, international cooperation among countries and organizations has become inevitable for the last decades. During this interaction process, many actors and systems affect countries' drug policies. This leads international actors such as UNODC and EMCDDA and external dynamics has become more prominent with the effect of globalization.  The thesis examined the several public policy theories in order to understand drug policy making in Turkey. Theories of policy diffusion, lesson drawing, and policy transfer and policy convergence are analyzed and applied to Turkey's drug policy.  Thesis concluded that the fundamental dynamics of Turkey's policy making process against drugs are the affected by international drug control regimes and Turkey's integration to EU membership and acquis communautaire. It is also concluded that UNODC and EMCDDA are the most powerful actors in drug policy making process of Turkey. As a result of policy transfers, Turkey's general policy understanding, fundamental approach, policy areas, policy documents and policy instruments converge with the policies of EU in terms of structural and contextual level. Policy convergence in the framework of expectations of the EU is discussed as yet to be reached to the desired level and developed policy recommendations.",,,,,Economy; Humanities; Geography; Drug policies; Drug control; Policy making process; Lesson drawing; Policy making,,,,,https://acikarsiv.ankara.edu.tr/browse/26960/,https://acikarsiv.ankara.edu.tr/browse/26960/,,,1494799360,,0,,0,false,,

Diffusion studies focus almost exclusively on the rate of change, thus ignoring possible variance in the content of programs selected by leaders, followers, and laggards. States may adopt new programs in one area, such as state-mandated student testing. While most states now have a testing policy, these policies vary in terms of the number of students subject to examinations. Thus, the amount of program change depends on the content of each state's policy. An interstate diffusion study of the pattern of program adoptions ignores this variance. It is also possible that policy scope is influenced by certain aspects of the diffusion process. One possibility is that program innovators generally select more extensive programs than followers. Similarities or differences in policy scope among adopters may also be related to innovation attributes (e.g., whether a new program is symbolic, redistributive, or administratively complex). Finally, the number of years requiredfor interstate diffusion may result in similarities or differences in policy content.",15,4,61,70,Public economics; Diffusion (business); Political science; Variance (accounting); State (polity); Scope (project management); Policy Scope,,,,,https://academic.oup.com/publius/article/15/4/61/1879676,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a037569,,10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a037569,2328832087,,0,,61,false,,

However, the drivers of institutional change are still little understood. We focus on a recent fundamental institutional change: the worldwide switch to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The switch to IFRS was unexpected and not particularly welcomed by MNEs given that most national accounting systems in the pre-IFRS period were considered to be well aligned to the local cultural and environmental characteristics of each country. We test the drivers of this institutional change in a sample of 168 countries between 2002 and 2012 using empirical constructs from policy diffusion theory. Our findings show that the country-level decisions to adopt IFRS are not driven by local determinants but instead by adoption decisions by other, neighbouring countries and influential organizations. We find evidence for competition, learning and emulation as driving forces for the international spread of IFRS. We conclude that the switch to IFRS was not driven by an economic rationale only and diffused beyond the influence and interest of MNEs. Understanding these drivers is essential, because it enables management to anticipate and respond to institutional changes and consequently enhance performance and create competitive advantage.",49,3,249,271,Institutional theory; Economics; International business; International Financial Reporting Standards; Competition (economics); Institutional change; National accounts; Market economy; Sample (statistics); Competitive advantage,,,,,https://repub.eur.nl/pub/103315 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pal:jintbs:v:49:y:2018:i:3:d:10.1057_s41267-017-0123-7 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3161415 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41267-017-0123-7 https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jintbs/v49y2018i3d10.1057_s41267-017-0123-7.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41267-017-0123-7,,10.1057/s41267-017-0123-7,2775415988,,0,000-631-304-964-644; 001-367-136-082-787; 002-943-615-906-965; 003-500-891-760-724; 004-916-367-446-865; 005-249-461-623-469; 007-123-559-698-935; 007-219-463-696-587; 014-174-295-514-111; 016-931-529-179-271; 018-228-062-864-635; 021-234-012-940-010; 021-907-061-236-840; 022-512-643-506-628; 023-672-511-213-267; 027-827-119-143-849; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-388-056-843-087; 036-918-574-243-85X; 037-996-320-532-301; 039-404-057-786-099; 040-340-861-420-27X; 043-167-947-867-139; 046-866-095-243-909; 048-402-768-826-373; 048-836-557-499-227; 050-102-111-690-296; 050-671-315-820-339; 050-867-063-363-278; 051-563-283-713-00X; 056-705-902-281-14X; 057-621-004-140-001; 064-737-012-164-44X; 065-319-944-240-961; 065-351-060-473-364; 065-666-299-776-558; 066-141-735-734-026; 068-966-797-980-344; 069-664-910-752-005; 071-567-682-955-421; 076-101-297-253-906; 077-586-669-831-629; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 083-128-427-871-272; 085-228-051-244-908; 086-077-195-670-27X; 088-544-938-747-673; 088-996-182-508-847; 089-316-069-670-812; 089-591-882-730-140; 093-190-746-631-057; 093-356-416-723-378; 093-529-571-626-597; 095-272-592-807-399; 102-330-825-525-291; 105-526-785-996-251; 110-525-069-323-589; 111-255-013-433-673; 111-361-728-409-836; 111-441-658-534-366; 115-482-499-323-938; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-251-641-909-302; 123-885-768-042-250; 126-729-711-774-56X; 129-556-528-635-760; 129-675-832-897-775; 130-470-922-875-63X; 135-954-951-614-87X; 136-960-539-858-124; 140-052-770-193-728; 141-569-781-718-049; 149-711-693-971-306; 154-418-473-034-36X; 156-586-921-097-184; 157-196-053-082-670; 157-509-304-581-488; 158-351-705-084-801; 163-637-734-144-951; 177-089-335-862-917; 185-843-997-896-771; 193-107-258-263-342,25,false,,

022-060-341-160-436,A social network perspective on the interaction between policy bubbles,2020-04-27,2020,journal article,International Review of Public Policy,26793873; 27066274,OpenEdition,,Moshe Maor,"Studies of policy bubbles have so far ignored the possibility that a policy bubble in a given policy domain or jurisdiction may constitute an information event for another policy bubble that has been inflated elsewhere. In addition, studies of policy diffusion have paid little attention to the transmission of imperfect and wrongful policy valuations through social networks. To bridge these gaps, this article develops a theoretical framework and methodological toolbox for explaining the potential impact of interbubble dynamics on the sustainment of policy bubbles. This is achieved by focusing on: (i) the diffusion of interbubble connectivity information through social networks characterized by varying levels of segregation; (ii) the perceptions of distorted or corrected information by individuals at the receiving end as being factual, thus requiring no gap-filling by policy actors, or as an opinion that therefore requires gap-filling; (iii) the derived consequence in terms of simple or complex contagion; and (iv) its impact on the sustainment of policy bubbles. The main contribution of the article lies in unpacking the potential causal mechanisms through which a policy bubble can be sustained, even if positive feedback processes and contagion in the jurisdiction within which it developed no longer bolster its support bases.",2,1,24,44,Complex contagion; Economics; Microeconomics; Perspective (graphical); Perception; Event (relativity); Jurisdiction; Imperfect; Bridge (interpersonal); Social network,,,,,https://journals.openedition.org/irpp/pdf/774 https://journals.openedition.org/irpp/774,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/irpp.774,,10.4000/irpp.774,3019559206,,0,002-145-706-717-303; 002-557-636-257-591; 004-043-278-644-800; 008-487-233-701-114; 010-314-314-468-912; 011-966-058-815-654; 012-415-218-330-812; 012-660-104-322-856; 012-856-320-267-075; 018-069-961-863-673; 020-007-210-853-325; 020-761-122-724-376; 023-672-511-213-267; 026-412-549-797-331; 028-887-262-912-445; 030-750-429-460-108; 032-469-279-868-172; 038-159-123-699-928; 043-098-145-788-803; 047-622-710-217-530; 049-046-041-071-190; 049-521-821-904-229; 049-525-562-019-812; 050-274-654-059-514; 050-342-174-041-587; 051-563-283-713-00X; 051-925-465-626-092; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-622-421-980-598; 059-850-774-734-000; 065-820-911-060-04X; 066-349-480-390-980; 069-159-800-298-051; 071-386-896-041-710; 073-166-408-788-371; 076-240-693-922-091; 079-431-541-601-150; 079-952-140-440-177; 080-829-579-259-085; 081-279-772-432-364; 082-032-427-434-416; 083-004-413-576-470; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-187-606-231-189; 085-161-430-917-726; 086-109-841-436-896; 087-477-108-167-035; 092-935-319-368-570; 093-145-267-349-369; 095-669-794-220-129; 098-353-841-797-309; 103-588-215-051-505; 104-537-554-462-284; 105-133-789-777-120; 107-349-564-549-966; 109-088-454-784-308; 111-819-171-804-346; 112-333-966-495-520; 115-482-499-323-938; 124-994-169-976-149; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-584-985-547-01X; 127-373-546-880-036; 138-988-634-851-761; 140-858-482-838-942; 176-503-345-697-964; 183-116-647-935-415; 183-911-782-371-475; 186-170-460-484-825; 194-940-006-396-313,4,true,cc-by,gold

Much recent political analysis of public regulation tends to regard this worldwide spread of the American model, or regulatory state, as a typical example of a policy diffusion mechanism, such as emulation or regulatory competition. After critically examining that view, this article develops an alternative framework that combines international structural forces, such as techno-economic changes and ideational factors, and domestic institutional factors, in particular, path dependence of historical institutions. The cross-national and cross-sectoral case analysis (the financial services and communications sector in Britain and Japan) demonstrates that while apparent convergence on the American model is due to international structural forces, national and sectoral differences with respect to the extent of organizational changes depend largely on domestic institutions. This finding suggests that, facing complex dynamism between international structural forces and domestic institutions, each national government chooses the feature of regulatory organization independently from other nations decisions, rather than interdependently as assumed in the policy diffusion approach.</jats:p>",6,1,,,Neoliberalism; Economy; Financial services; Economics; Globalization; Regulatory state; Path dependence; Style (sociolinguistics); Institutional diversity; Economic system,,,,,https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/wps/6/1/article-wps.2010.6.1.1083.xml.xml?language=en https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201902214376162051,http://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1935-6226.1083,,10.2202/1935-6226.1083,2005652163,,0,,2,false,,

Wiedenbeck,"I examine the impact federal courts have on state policy diffusion through the use of computational text analysis. Using a dyadic framework, I model the impact courts have on the decision to adopt a policy and, if adopted, how much text to borrow directly from another state’s preexisting law. A court decision ruling a statute unconstitutional can generate up to a 47% relative reduction in the probability of adoption, and a ruling of constitutionality can generate a relative increase as high as 519% in the amount of borrowed text. These findings shed light on how states learn from one another. ∗Funded by the National Science Foundation (Law and Social Science, SES-1155066). †I would like to thank the many people who have given me helpful comments and provided invaluable insights including Brandon Bartels, Bill Berry, Fran Berry, Amanda Driscoll, Jeff Gill, Morgan Hazelton, Pauline Kim, Bill Lowry, Andrew Martin, Jacob Montgomery, Ryan Moore, Michael Nelson, Jim Spriggs, Peter Wiedenbeck and the participants of the 2013 Visions in Methodology conference.

022-778-578-583-712,The Bologna Process Goes East? from “Third Countries” to Prioritizing Inter-regional Cooperation Between the ASEAN and EU,,2015,book chapter,The European Higher Education Area,,Springer International Publishing,,Que Anh Dang,"The Bologna Process increasingly prioritizes its dialogues and negotiations with regions over individual countries, thus expanding its outreach to a larger scale. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations—ASEAN and ASEAN+3—which are developing collective mechanisms for regional harmonization, have become one of the strategic regions for the EU partnerships in higher education. This paper draws on policy diffusion approach in regional studies literature and a constructivist approach to policy movement and mutation in geography to examine how Bologna policies have travelled to ASEAN and transformed their features and effects in the new context. Bringing the theoretical frameworks from political science and geography into higher education studies, this paper attempts to make a novel methodological contribution. Tracing the evolution of the ASEAN regional cooperation in higher education over the last four decades and using first-hand empirical data, this paper argues that although the Bologna Process provides a point of reference for ASEAN, the active construction of an ASEAN regional higher education space in its flexible institutional design can become a model in its own right and potentially provide a useful source for reflecting on European Bologna practices.",,,763,783,Higher education; Regional science; International trade; Political science; Negotiation; Bologna Process; Harmonization; Context (language use); Outreach; Southeast asian; Regionalism (international relations),,,,,https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/the-bologna-process-goes-east-from-third-countries-to-prioritizin https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20877-0_47/fulltext.html https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20877-0_47 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-20877-0_47.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20877-0_47 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/the-bologna-process-goes-east-from-third-countries-to-prioritizin https://core.ac.uk/display/81850385 http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/the-bologna-process-goes-east-from-third-countries-to-prioritizing-interregional-cooperation-between-the-asean-and-eu(fde43916-5ace-455d-8049-112e8dfe8186)/export.html https://core.ac.uk/download/228154529.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20877-0_47,,10.1007/978-3-319-20877-0_47,1959480380,,0,003-544-056-320-324; 008-271-422-452-193; 008-451-054-330-616; 011-156-863-872-040; 011-304-548-657-289; 011-717-091-918-455; 013-860-156-228-610; 016-428-466-146-596; 019-325-109-553-035; 022-512-643-506-628; 026-100-150-542-238; 027-827-119-143-849; 033-439-913-031-740; 035-691-599-900-318; 041-937-732-867-751; 049-692-065-216-979; 052-455-537-292-670; 057-146-013-648-771; 060-715-195-382-825; 063-843-370-565-043; 074-576-186-961-367; 074-656-824-423-353; 084-926-016-480-122; 086-163-694-850-604; 096-765-292-366-642; 115-482-499-323-938; 126-083-543-964-750; 127-970-915-933-865; 130-258-178-703-953; 132-165-403-833-894; 136-674-852-981-228; 139-090-015-880-868; 148-477-444-628-794; 153-615-828-957-208; 155-180-161-631-72X; 166-467-505-400-165,19,true,cc-by-nc,hybrid

O'Brien,"Young Nam Cho, Local People 's Congresses in China: Development and Transition. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. 192pp. US$80.00 (hardcover). Ming Xia, The People 's Congresses and Governance in China: Toward a Network Mode of Governance. London: Routledge, 2007. 300pp. US$130.00 (hardcover). Taken together, these two books depict the role that local People's Congresses (FPCs) play in Chinese politics. The image that emerges is somewhat unexpected. One might have thought that the crucial question about FPCs centers on how representative they are. What stands out in these accounts, however, is how little attention is devoted to elections, deputy-constituent ties and speaking out at plenary sessions. For Young Nam Cho and Ming Xia, the big story is occurring inside the state, and concerns institutionalization, multi-step deliberation and enhanced oversight. Administrative reforms have transformed the policy process, and new arenas have been created to manage conflict. FPCs have benefited greatly from this re-division of labor and are not a ""rival show"" or a ""rubber stamp"" (Xia, p. 228) but partners in governance providing a venue for interested parties (mostly within the bureaucracy) to work out disagreements. Energetic FPCs are first and foremost a sign that where Chinese politics takes place has changed. Fegislative development, in this way of thinking, has less to do with responsiveness and changing state-society relations and more to do with statebuilding, restructuring bureaucratic ties and making Party rule predictable and effective. If FPCs have become a ""strong political force in local politics"" (Cho, p. 163) but have been empowered only selectively (with much more attention to lawmaking and oversight than to representation), what does this imply about the shape of the Chinese polity?1 More simply, what do local People's Congresses do, what do they not do, and what does their mixture of activism and quiescence say about how governance is changing? Evidence and Variation Students of LPCs sometimes fall prey to cherry-picking instances of assertiveness, and downplay the fact that most congresses remain pliant and passive. Cho and Xia do not avoid this trap entirely. Many passages, especially in Xia's book, detail the most exciting (but perhaps least representative) episodes of contestation, muscularity in lawmaking and vigorous oversight. The significance of events such as vetoing a court work report (the ""Shenyang Incident"") or interpellating and then refusing to ratify several bureau directors (the ""Guangdong Phenomena"") (Cho, pp. 1-2) can at times be difficult to evaluate, and a feeling lingers that atypical occurrences (and unusually hardworking congresses) have been blown up beyond their import.2 That said, both authors have assembled convincing evidence that LPCs are more active than previously thought and that many are closer to the local center of power than the National People's Congress (NPC) is in Beijing (Cho, p. 163; Xia, p. 25O).3 At a time when the NPC often appears sleepy and handcuffed, the most enterprising local congresses introduce innovations that begin in the provinces and spread outwards. Formerly quiet LPCs emulate dynamic neighbors, and policy diffusion occurs on issues including nationalities' autonomy, consumer rights and the protection of children (Xia, pp. 163-64; Cho, pp. 15, 165). 4 Provincial congresses, especially, have filled a void created by too few national laws promoting economic liberalization (Xia, p. 5), such that, by the late 1990s, legislators in Shanghai and Shenzhen were heard bragging about how advanced their congresses were compared to the NPC, in terms both of top-notch staff and an ability to enact controversial laws.5 Still, legislative activism remains uneven, among and within provinces (Cho, p. 5).6 In the absence of a nationwide sample (or armies of scholars studying People's Congresses), Cho offers a number of useful hypotheses about variation and how to understand it. …",61,61,131,141,Political science; China; Power (social and political); State (polity); Lawmaking; Polity; Public administration; Bureaucracy; Autonomy; Politics,,,,,http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/tcj.61.20648048 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5kk8z6zx.pdf https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/tcj.61.20648048 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5kk8z6zx https://escholarship.org/content/qt5kk8z6zx/qt5kk8z6zx.pdf?t=ny6ah1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/tcj.61.20648048,,10.1086/tcj.61.20648048,2507498901,,0,,26,true,,green

Franzese; Jude C. Hays; Lena Maria Schaffer,"Spatial/Spatiotemporal interdependence - i.e., that the outcomes, actions, or choices of some unit-times depend on those of others - is substantively and theoretically ubiquitous and central in binary outcomes of interest across the social sciences. However, most empirical applications omit spatial interdependence and, at best, treat temporal dependence as nuisance to be “kludged”; indeed, even theoretical and substantive discussion usually ignores (inter)dependence. Moreover, in the few contexts where spatial interdependence has been acknowledged or emphasized, such as in the social-network and policy-diffusion literatures, empirical models either do not fully reflect the simultaneity of the outcomes across units, or they do not recognize the endogeneity of the spatial lags which are used (appropriately) to model the interdependence. This paper notes and explains some of the severe challenges posed by spatiotemporal interdependence in binary-outcome models and then follows recent spatial-econometric advances to suggest two simulation-based approaches for surmounting the computational intensiveness of these models: classical recursive-importance-sampling (RIS) or Bayesian Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Serial autocorrelation in binary outcomes raises essentially the same challenges, so these strategies offer effective approach to temporal dependence as well. We provide Monte-Carlo comparisons of the performance of these alternative estimators for spatial probit, including comparisons to estimation-strategies blind to or naive about (inter)dependence - i.e., omitting spatial lags or including them but treating them as exogenous regressors in standard probit estimation - and then we show how to apply related simulation methods to calculate estimated spatial effects of hypothetical shocks in terms of outcomes or probabilities of outcomes (with associated confidence/credibility regions) rather than only in parameter-estimate or latent-variable terms as in all prior spatial-probit applications. We illustrate with applications to U.S. states’ adoptions of legislative term-limits and to great-power decisions to enter World War I.",,,,,Statistics; Bayesian probability; Spatial dependence; Econometrics; Autoregressive model; Economics; Probit; Autocorrelation; Endogeneity; Probit model; Simultaneity,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1643867 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1668835_code382967.pdf?abstractid=1643867&mirid=3 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Franzese_Jr/publication/228237952_Spatial_Temporal_and_Spatiotemporal_Autoregressive_Probit_Models_of_Binary_Outcomes_Estimation_Interpretation_and_Presentation/links/02bfe511d8dc164519000000.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1643867,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1643867,,,50990484,,0,000-342-081-879-82X; 000-853-567-504-707; 002-090-110-364-521; 003-193-896-799-954; 004-598-305-294-690; 006-642-523-591-720; 009-292-558-538-50X; 009-994-163-085-776; 010-278-292-671-040; 011-084-490-504-594; 011-524-577-511-566; 012-420-020-580-599; 012-890-181-789-568; 019-831-470-017-470; 024-764-912-784-102; 025-032-090-855-719; 026-646-507-045-635; 026-932-734-844-813; 027-482-972-782-022; 032-718-453-083-675; 033-085-475-899-252; 033-095-549-902-282; 034-949-264-405-429; 036-276-500-889-242; 039-267-066-031-511; 040-395-625-023-262; 040-532-896-815-85X; 047-541-831-866-620; 048-402-689-004-611; 053-037-278-312-466; 061-373-791-267-531; 062-280-241-152-821; 067-950-549-357-577; 069-687-707-841-469; 070-067-783-279-779; 073-799-351-414-175; 077-926-704-396-107; 087-272-768-824-329; 095-148-108-214-877; 096-459-671-838-210; 097-442-979-263-033; 097-759-643-529-50X; 098-034-149-404-46X; 107-271-119-139-232; 114-279-543-656-810; 117-933-492-590-892; 122-585-005-907-358; 124-749-916-040-223; 125-386-795-922-612; 131-900-393-723-959; 145-053-024-293-096; 148-435-936-365-374; 148-926-758-581-758; 155-580-858-393-517; 171-140-774-763-032; 172-516-984-577-966; 184-531-448-489-154; 185-228-031-155-946; 189-161-123-628-108; 195-068-563-903-397; 196-100-633-795-509,27,false,,

Methodologically, the intention is to clarify aspects of this dissemination process, based on the identification of the actors involved, their claims and the course of their actions, offering, in this sense, alternative and complementary explanations to the most established studies on the processes of public policy diffusion. The main findings are two set of actors, who have influenced two courses of action: the first one linked with the cooperation with Latin American countries about, mainly, family farmer and social public policies (cash transfer, school feed); and the second linked with the Brazilian cooperation with some African countries on topics related to agribusiness and scientific research and improvement of agricultural techniques.",,45,77,88,Public policy; Government; Latin Americans; Agribusiness; Political science; Foreign policy analysis; Food policy; Course of action; Welfare economics; Foreign policy,,,,,https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/handle/10396/21614 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=8131089,https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/handle/10396/21614,,,3202966519,,0,,0,false,,

The theoretical background of policy diffusion is applied to explain the objectives of higher education attainment and internationalization. The panel regression analysis explains relationships among macroeconomic variables, where the dependent variable is higher education attainment. Assessing opportunities of and challenges to policy reform, the quantitative analysis of data for EU countries, between the years 2000 and 2014, highlights Portugal and Spain. This research method is useful to identify variables in the political economy that may have a relationship with the objectives of the Bologna Process and Europe 2020.

Li,"Performance funding has become an increasingly prevalent state policy to incentivize student retention and degree completion at public colleges. Using a Cox proportional hazards model on state-level data from years 2000 to 2013, this study analyzes the latest wave of policies that embed base appropriations into the state budget to fund student outcomes. Results indicate that having a greater proportion of bordering performance funding states diminishes the likelihood of policy adoption, capturing a “reverse policy diffusion” effect. States with Republican-controlled legislatures, more professionalized legislatures, and rapid growth in unemployment rates are more likely to adopt the policy, while those with higher educational attainment levels and more bachelor’s degrees awarded per student are less likely. Implications include the surprising finding of reverse policy diffusion, which suggests that states are delaying adoption until after they can observe the political consequences and impacts of the policy in neighboring states. Findings point to a policy learning effect—by observing other state’s experiences, policymakers can make more informed decisions about whether to pursue performance funding as an accountability tool.",58,7,746,771,Public economics; Public policy; Higher education; Policy analysis; Economics; Accountability; State (polity); Unemployment; Educational attainment; Public administration; Legislature,,,,American Educational Research Association; Institute of Education Sciences; TIAA-CREF Institute,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1157244 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/reihed/v58y2017i7d10.1007_s11162-016-9444-9.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-016-9444-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11162-016-9444-9,,10.1007/s11162-016-9444-9,2568680739,,0,001-481-906-279-295; 013-126-282-071-945; 013-836-584-467-183; 014-448-931-765-428; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-911-413-598-284; 019-401-004-582-069; 023-236-082-357-690; 023-831-104-510-956; 024-681-098-935-143; 025-316-114-842-053; 026-715-706-088-861; 027-835-981-532-333; 032-617-153-708-271; 036-961-749-635-681; 042-682-881-364-140; 043-413-024-408-20X; 055-267-246-442-334; 057-365-325-883-99X; 057-510-885-060-973; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-673-264-634-582; 060-028-692-713-707; 062-222-159-195-376; 064-814-171-153-461; 065-829-054-116-66X; 066-022-083-500-512; 067-490-686-317-462; 071-255-501-927-489; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-244-530-255-25X; 081-129-433-287-031; 081-840-373-163-25X; 085-758-883-058-321; 086-616-517-831-399; 090-041-286-739-367; 096-362-816-439-456; 096-548-920-809-272; 102-490-342-063-275; 114-591-146-270-371; 117-565-033-944-544; 130-143-251-672-218; 135-495-661-651-146; 140-794-852-826-608; 146-921-126-094-067; 148-832-222-160-771; 154-314-204-508-516; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-076-040-775-567; 171-176-487-306-124; 174-136-060-342-997; 176-808-817-473-940; 184-567-864-553-172; 195-117-022-355-883,32,false,,
024-287-628-948-73X,Next Stop Stockholm? The Role of Ideas in Shaping French Prostitution Policy Since 2002,,2012,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Emily St. Denny,"In April 2011 the French information mission on prostitution called for the implementation of a policy of client criminalization inspired by the 1998 Swedish law. However, despite presenting a “Swedish model” of prostitution policy as a new and desirable alternative, the same policy actors had in fact made a previous unsuccessful attempt to bring about client criminalization almost a decade earlier in which they had criticized the Swedish version of this law. In light of this, traditional approaches to policy diffusion predicated on the inherent worthiness of ideas and norms cannot adequately account for such a strategic repackaging of a previously rejected idea. Therefore, drawing from the diverse literature on policy change, policy learning and diffusion, this paper deploys an ideational approach to account for the reemergence of a debate over client criminalization in France. This paper argues that domestic actors seeking to remove the constraints on reform posed by path dependency and uncertainty can strategically use knowledge and ideas gleaned from abroad, and the reference to successful foreign models, in a bid to generate credibility and legitimacy for their preferred ideas. In particular, evidence from the comparison of the two policy proposals suggests that during windows of opportunity offered by the collapse of a current policy, such ideas can serve as the basis for a new ideational consensus around which to consolidate a policy coalition.",,,,,Policy analysis; Political science; Law and economics; Law; Policy learning; Credibility; Criminalization; Path dependency; Legitimacy,,,,,https://ssrn.com/abstract=2108937,https://ssrn.com/abstract=2108937,,,1877819660,,0,081-069-471-541-887; 117-677-347-760-402; 125-268-617-755-543,0,false,,

Difusao de Politicas Publicas. Sao Bernardo do Campo: Publisher UFABC, 2016)It is a welcoming introduction to the Brazilian academic community the arrival of the book 'Public Policy Diffusion', edited by Professors Faria, Coelho and Jard da Silva. As it is stated in the opening pages of the book, the use of diffusion models is very incipient in Brazil in comparison to the level of knowledge accumulation in the international literature, especially in the USA. In this sense, it is an admirable effort to gather together ten chapters not only discussing the dissemination and adoption of public policies but also presenting a diverse collection in terms of perspectives and models possible to be used as an analytical reference.But, in my view, this book could also be read as attempted explanations for the adoption of policies, practices and ideas in the Brazilian case. With the exception of the first chapter (by COELHO), which discusses analytical tools of this literature, nine out of the ten chapters include Brazil in their analysis, either as a single case or in comparison to other Latin American countries and worldwide. Although it is not the purpose of the editors, I could not avoid making connections among chapters thinking about possible general findings for the Brazilian case, which I will discuss further on.For the unfamiliar reader, the phenomenon of policy diffusion could be summarized in the following puzzle: why and how some policies get to be considered as 'good practices' and adopted by other governments?Let us first say that diffusion or transference of policies is not something neww in policy systems. What is new is an academic interest to study the phenomenon and to extract regular patterns for explanation. One thing, then, is to show policies, practices or social technologies being spread or disseminated among governments, but something quite different is to attempt to explain why and how this happens in the attempt of constructing theories of policy diffusion, transfer or, more generally, learning.Some models of explanations, concepts and types of mechanisms that could produce diffusion are presented and discussed. Although there is no unity in the use and applications of the analytical tools and concepts among authors, it is possible to extract some basic features of policy diffusion models.We learn that countries or subnational governments may 01. innovate, that is, adopt a new policy, program or practice; 02. emulate (adapting the original policy to local contexts and objectives) or 03. copy the original policy (associated with coercion). Innovation does not equate to invention as it is understood as ""a program that is new to the government adopting it"" (BERRY and BERRY, 2007). These are pioneering experiences that may lead to the spreading or adoption by other governments. Emulation does not equate to copying. It means that local conditions and actors will play a role by adapting the original policy to their own needs and beliefs. The case of copying the original policy without adaptation, argue some of the authors, would be more common in countries that do not have enough bureaucratic/state capacity and it is normally associated with the adoption of certain practices as a condition for loans from international agencies. Hence the label 'coercion' for this type of mechanism in which governments do not have, really, much of a choice.Countries may also be analyzed as 'importers' or 'exporters' of policy innovation as some of the authors argue.Based on the readings of the Brazilian case presented throughout the book, one learns that Brazil (also valid for other Latin American countries) has 'imported' and/or diffused domestically the ideas of economic liberalization, regulatory agencies after privatization (chapter by JORDANA), new models of reforming Public Pension (by JARDIM and JARD DA SILVA) and also models of administrative/management reforms (by ABRUCIO, SANO and SEGATTO; and also by PALOTTI, PEREIRA and CAMOES). …",11,2,1,,Public policy; Sociology; Government; Latin Americans; Coercion; Copying; Public administration; Social science; Phenomenon; Bureaucracy; Economic liberalization,,,,,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bpsr/v11n2/1981-3821-bpsr-1981-3821201700020010.pdf http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1981-38212017000200602 https://core.ac.uk/display/87776889 http://www.scielo.br/j/bpsr/a/63zrnxbJh4frCxdv8GBPSwt/ https://brazilianpoliticalsciencereview.org/wp-content/uploads/articles_xml/1981-3821-bpsr-1981-3821201700020010/1981-3821-bpsr-1981-3821201700020010.pdf https://brazilianpoliticalsciencereview.org/article/diffusion-of-policies-practices-and-social-technologies-in-brazil/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1981-3821201700020010,,10.1590/1981-3821201700020010,2738190364,,0,,3,true,cc-by,gold
024-589-667-047-399,Who follows the leaders? Foreign economic policy diffusion 1978-2004,,2007,,,,,,Christian Martin; Gerald Schneider,"Foreign economic policy liberalization is marked by remarkable variation across countries. While there has been a general trend towards less restrictive trade and capital account regulations, important differences remain. We present a model of foreign economic policy making in which a country’s specific liberalization costs interact with levels of foreign economic policy regulation in other countries. Specifically, by changing opportunity costs of restrictive policies, liberalization steps in other countries change the optimal level of foreign economic policy restrictiveness in a given country. However, changes to current account regulations do not occur automatically. Rather, they are conditioned by domestic costs of liberalization. Diffusion processes, therefore, do not necessarily result in policy convergence. We test the predictions of the model by drawing on a data set that covers policy measures in the area of trade and capital account regulation. The data cover 140 countries in the time from 1978 to 2004. Using an empirical model of conditional policy diffusion, we show that the data match the predictions of uneven patterns of liberalization.",,,,,Economic policy; Economics; Foreign policy analysis; Convergence (economics); Capital account; Current account; Economic liberalization; Liberalization; Opportunity cost; Foreign policy,,,,,,,,,2739831821,,0,019-454-920-846-524; 025-193-488-999-63X; 033-004-670-084-406; 045-312-470-986-632; 077-926-704-396-107; 121-581-061-262-350; 177-926-282-294-594; 179-393-417-066-358,0,false,,

The visa policy explored here covers the Schengen Area (including EU Member States and other countries, as well as EU countries that are still outside the Schengen). The Schengen Area does not include two EU Member States—the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland—that have opted out from the EU’s visa policies and operate a common travel area between them. Furthermore, the common visa policy in the EU is related to the issuance of short-term visas, while visas of longer duration and residence permits remain in the national domain. Against this background, the visa policy of the EU has four relevant aspects. First, the gradual evolution of the Schengen Area has been driven not only by political developments within the EU and its Member States, but also by broader global developments (e.g., the fall of communism). Second, the consolidation of the internal and external aspects of the visa policy in the EU took place through the growth of the Schengen acquis. Third, visa liberalization has become one of the most powerful tools for policy diffusion beyond the EU’s borders. Finally, securitization of migration has had a strong impact on the EU’s visa policy, particularly in the domains of information exchange and police cooperation.</p>",,,,,International trade; Political science; Securitization; European union,,,,,https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1092,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1092,,10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1092,3003065624,,0,,0,false,,

Parinandi,"In this article, I evaluate whether a state’s level of bureaucratic discretionary authority with respect to welfare policy makes that state more or less likely to participate in policy diffusion with other states that share similar levels of bureaucratic discretionary authority. Using data on levels of access to welfare services in the late Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) era (1976–90), I find that bureaucrats across states who are granted high-discretionary authority engage in policy diffusion with one another. Diffusion based on similarity in discretionary authority is more pronounced when bureaucrats possess high compared with no discretion and does not occur when bureaucrats possess low discretion. Moreover, diffusion between high-discretion bureaucrats operates concurrently with geographic- and economic-driven forms of diffusion that have been well documented in the policy diffusion literature. Results demonstrate that a state’s choice of how much discretion to give bureaucrats can ope...",13,2,244,261,Public economics; Welfare; Public policy; Diffusion (business); Economics; State (polity); Discretion; Aid to Families with Dependent Children; Bureaucracy; Federalism,,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1532440013484477 http://spa.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1177/1532440013484477 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/conditional-bureaucratic-discretion-and-state-welfare-diffusion-under-afdc/BB90AF66DF20EE5D29C5F586A8A09B4C,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532440013484477,,10.1177/1532440013484477,3125104706,,0,002-090-110-364-521; 002-557-636-257-591; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-300-556-601-999; 008-653-694-174-709; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-371-821-839-122; 019-434-952-009-589; 033-085-475-899-252; 033-969-989-312-301; 036-961-749-635-681; 057-621-004-140-001; 064-753-387-756-134; 065-296-005-360-202; 067-490-686-317-462; 076-240-693-922-091; 082-017-566-839-450; 086-295-173-349-915; 087-744-847-701-151; 091-736-584-918-934; 101-127-387-013-017; 122-081-414-748-045; 127-006-867-188-345; 129-053-243-507-250; 137-674-676-505-121; 150-961-458-885-966; 155-580-858-393-517,3,false,,

Parinandi,"Cross-border commercial activity raises issues in federations where multiple jurisdictions can claim the right to tax the same income. In the United States, this coordination problem is resolved by splitting the tax base according to the geographic distribution of firms’ sales, capital and labour. The weight of each factor is determined on a state-by-state basis, which opens room for competitive legislative behaviour. In this complex issue area, however, policymakers must invest lot of resources to monitor competitors, evaluate policy alternatives and shepherd tax reform through the legislative process. This implies that highly professional legislatures should be more responsive to the policies of nearby states. We consider data on most American states over the period from 1986 to 2013 and find strong evidence of conditional spatial dependence.

China did show interest in improving governance by adopting policies that they believed made the tiny Southeast Asian city-state “perfectly managed.” But given the very different political “DNA” of the two countries, policy diffusion was unsurprisingly limited.

For all that is known about the diffusion of policies in a political context, less is understood about why some states ultimately end up with policies that are similar in structure, but vastly different in content. Do the forces that drive states to policy action also shape the content of the enacted policies? Examining the case of renewable energy policy among US states over a fourteen-year period, this paper addresses this question using event history analysis and an original longitudinal data set of state political and economic characteristics. State’s energy economy, the presence of Democratic politicians, and environmental movement organizations are found to be important for determining the kind of policy a state ultimately enacts, while regional policy adoption explains why some states choose to enact largely symbolic renewable energy policies. Policy adoption should be conceptualized as a multifaceted process, with different factors acting as the impetus for action and others shaping the content of the policy. Understanding the nuanced roles of state characteristics and policy diffusion in the policy adoption process requires avoiding binary outcomes of passage or inaction in favor of simultaneously examining both policy action and policy content.",92,4,1637,1657,Public economics; Public policy; Policy analysis; Political economy; Economics; Foreign policy analysis; Policy studies; Environmental movement; State (polity); Regional policy; Context (language use),,,,,http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/4/1637.short https://muse.jhu.edu/article/546229/figure/tab03 https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/92/4/1637/2235849/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sou011,,10.1093/sf/sou011,1971877635,,0,005-261-328-376-894; 006-196-380-889-302; 008-414-059-072-131; 010-312-505-376-499; 012-287-435-280-010; 014-109-709-677-148; 014-414-761-633-960; 015-596-452-187-457; 017-270-096-109-606; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-456-406-334-322; 019-731-055-680-787; 022-440-254-906-310; 025-896-910-956-266; 028-333-623-476-913; 029-725-641-263-961; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-181-914-602-652; 039-898-061-324-949; 041-286-103-459-425; 041-886-975-591-908; 044-045-984-053-178; 045-305-507-819-665; 045-872-754-001-087; 047-385-352-717-976; 049-219-615-824-319; 050-355-044-431-360; 050-950-951-032-538; 051-147-203-352-978; 052-723-818-069-06X; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-928-399-224-937; 064-463-299-403-755; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-714-892-765-613; 072-371-781-500-707; 072-887-207-186-482; 073-264-842-289-988; 074-513-069-037-193; 075-046-752-556-824; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-413-548-207-63X; 079-079-587-391-558; 083-099-894-950-017; 086-334-435-730-396; 089-716-366-806-766; 092-894-604-833-533; 101-123-023-161-977; 105-872-293-874-778; 109-204-214-997-350; 113-613-485-914-619; 115-631-793-638-558; 117-005-511-150-947; 118-821-841-615-251; 125-904-861-101-343; 134-300-624-191-268; 134-946-281-336-412; 142-927-872-720-578; 144-565-224-985-428; 145-260-087-070-588; 152-131-909-938-976; 154-228-278-302-026; 155-580-858-393-517; 158-588-055-323-588; 158-971-435-462-119; 173-567-809-531-297; 177-458-303-240-989; 180-187-712-085-074; 199-079-145-414-442,21,false,,

The results suggest that states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal factors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and simultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political costs, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range of governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments' decisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably more likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic impact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that many states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.",,,,,Declaration; Business; Preparedness; Pandemic preparedness; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Development economics; Dictatorship; Democracy; Pandemic; Politics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00933 https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00933 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200700933L/abstract,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00933,,,3039386076,,0,,0,true,,
026-291-473-693-502,Influencing the roll out of good policies: an evaluation of governance tools,,2011,,,,,,Greg Marsden,"Research on sustainable transport planning has concluded that, for the most part, the policies that will lead to more sustainable outcomes are known and what is required is a more widespread and intense application of such measures. In response, upper tiers of government with responsibility for achieving policy goals and for steering the lower tiers of government are often faced with a dilemma of how to encourage these lower tiers to ‘do the right thing’. This paper examines the presumptions surrounding the spread of ‘good policies’, considers the motivations of actors at a lower tier when faced with pressure to adopt policies and, drawing on a series of case studies from Europe, discusses the potential for a range of different approaches to stimulate the more rapid uptake of ‘good policies’. The research concludes that greater attention needs to be given to the notions of policy diffusion and the different stages of adoption (or rejection) of policies. Much better use should be made of pilot studies to understand the likely adoption pathway for policies and the extent to which the policies will spread without active intervention. Where intervention is needed, better communication of the benefits and the use of incentives to encourage compliance are likely to be more effective than sanctions and regulations. Sanctions and regulations can be difficult to design, expensive to enforce or oversee and will, faced with an underlying reluctance to comply, lead to compliance on paper but limited action. Good policies are only good policies in particular circumstances and plans to support their roll out should recognise this.",,,,,Public economics; Government; Sustainable transport; Political science; Action (philosophy); Sanctions; Dilemma; Incentive; Corporate governance; Intervention (law),,,,,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/79000/,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/79000/,,,179431506,,0,001-053-570-248-178; 003-867-414-829-048; 007-448-559-677-996; 007-531-801-470-860; 016-961-368-271-647; 019-664-267-521-174; 026-081-804-976-529; 028-450-645-387-164; 040-556-239-222-794; 045-822-642-617-973; 058-275-475-629-425; 064-983-924-974-609; 117-677-347-760-402; 121-201-640-277-429; 137-451-427-281-958; 138-118-444-097-818; 195-387-145-761-267; 199-735-302-274-088,0,false,,

In this chapter, we explore a number of important elements of state regulation. First, we explain the basic rationale for why states are involved in the regulation of business activity. Second, we explore the historical power relationships between the states and the federal government. Transaction cost economics can help explain why the federal government must frequently play a role of coordinator among the states, yet this power can also be used to pre-empt state authority and impose federal viewpoints on the states. Third, we examine the delegation of regulatory policy to state bureaucracies, a process that depends to a large extent on the salience and complexity of the policy issue, but also on the interplay of organized interests, legislators, and state attorneys general. Fourth, we discuss the policy diffusion and regulatory competition literatures and find that economic competition can affect the scope and intensity of state regulation, but some ambiguity remains as to how this effect is manifested. Finally, we make comparisons of the states to the European Union and its member states and finish with concluding thoughts.</p>",,,,,Political science; International economics; State (polity); Competition (economics); Regulatory policy; Public administration; Bureaucracy; Federalism; Delegation; Transaction cost,,,,,http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199579679.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199579679-e-033 https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199579679.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199579679-e-033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199579679.013.033,,10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199579679.013.033,304229718,,0,,0,false,,

Large loans from the IMF shield policy makers from the costs of financial reform, while welfare expenditures provide credibility to the government’s ex ante promises of compensation to individuals who are harmed by the reforms. We test this hypothesis on data for 87 countries from 1975 to 2002. We employ a spatial autoregressive error sample selection model which accounts for the nonrandom participation of countries in IMF programs as well as the processes of international policy diffusion.

Greer; Jekyung Lee,"To resolve the limited access to capital by local governments due to the Great Recession, the United States Federal Government responded with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) which included the Build America Bond (BAB) program. The result of this program was considerable interest cost savings to state and local governments, but many local governments chose to issue traditional tax-exempt bonds instead of BABs. Using a policy diffusion framework and hazard model approach, we identify factors that affected the speed of BAB adoption by local governments. Results show that underwriter and financial adviser experience along with the internal characteristics of the local governments played a significant role in adoption.

Over the past 8 years, the zero-markup drug reform policy has been carried out in 4 pilot rounds (a policy diffusion model with Chinese characteristics) and has been promoted throughout the mainland China. At this critical point, it is necessary to review this policy systematically. Therefore, based on the literature, government documents, and interview records, this study analyzed the characteristics, progress, achievements, challenges, and recommendations of zero-markup drug reform by using the policy diffusion theory. The study found that zero-markup drug reform has completed its initial diffusion by use of the ""policy experiment"" method and has reduced drug prices and patients' burden to a certain extent. However, in the next phase of policy diffusion, the reform still requires adjustment and innovative measures to respond to future challenges. Generally speaking, as China's unique health care reform practice, the experience of zero-markup drug reform could be used as a reference for other countries to control drug prices, separate medical and pharmaceutical services, and establish a modern system of hospital operation.",33,4,918,929,Public economics; Mainland China; Business; Government; Phase (combat); China; Perspective (graphical); Control (management); Health care reform; Markup language,policy diffusion; policy experiment; policy progress; quality of healthcare; zero-markup drug reform,China; Comprehensive Health Care/organization & administration; Diffusion of Innovation; Drug Costs; Health Care Reform; Health Policy; Humans; Program Evaluation; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies,,Beijing Office of Philosophy and Social Science Planning (17GLC043); Beijing Office of Philosophy and Social Science Planning (17JDGLB008); Ministry of Education in China (16YJC630017); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation Committee (9174042); National Natural Science Foundation Committee of China (91746116); National Natural Science Foundation Committee of China (71603018); National Natural Science Foundation Committee of China (71432002); The Organization Department of the CPC Beijing municipal Party committee (2015000020124G047); Beijing Institute of Technology Research (3210012261598),https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201902282158626444 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hpm.2562 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29989204 https://researchportal.vub.be/en/publications/a-retrospective-and-prospective-assessment-of-the-zero-markup-dru https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29989204/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ijhplm/v33y2018i4pe918-e929.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2562,29989204,10.1002/hpm.2562,2871679493,,0,026-475-125-521-356; 050-208-093-302-75X; 051-077-434-011-512; 058-071-798-060-611; 091-537-291-932-132; 112-753-851-231-016; 148-080-266-155-481,19,false,,

Based on the analysis of labour market reforms in China between 2000 and 2012 and interview data obtained from EU-level and Chinese officials, this paper sets out to investigate the extent to which the European solution of flexicurity is diffused to China, a country with a massive pool of labour force and high reform intensity in the last decade. Guided by theoretical insights on policy diffusion literature, our findings propose that a partial diffusion (emulation between EU and China) exists, in which China has been keen to learn from European virtues to combine equality with economic growth. With regard to instruments provided by the flexicurity strategy, more learning than mimicking has occurred, that is, the Chinese have learned about the aspects of active labour market policies, public employment services and training services to embrace flexible labour market arrangements to rapidly adjust to changing labour market conditions as well as those aspects strengthening the basic social (insurance) safety nets to promote inclusive growth in a harmonious society.",,,245,261,Political science; China; Active labour market policies; Harmonious Society; Inclusive growth; Flexicurity; European union; Public employment; Interview data; Market economy; Development economics,,,,,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/teaching-the-dragon-the-diffusion-of-european-unions-social-and-e https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-1736-0_14/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-10-1736-0_14 https://purl.utwente.nl/publications/102802 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-1736-0_14 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2Ff7e6ec68-43d8-4b44-bb3b-5d3357500adf https://utwente-staging.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/teaching-the-dragon-the-diffusion-of-european-unions-social-and-e https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-1736-0_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-1736-0_14,,10.1007/978-981-10-1736-0_14,2483807785,,0,007-159-331-825-824; 010-747-159-767-448; 016-222-920-765-327; 026-971-579-705-54X; 027-271-815-135-26X; 046-871-834-972-803; 052-723-818-069-06X; 076-941-943-857-176; 077-945-151-328-246; 092-860-953-967-964; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-117-689-097-251; 108-073-287-153-964; 109-878-480-663-127; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 187-380-225-352-04X,2,false,,

International organizations’ mandates influence government behavior. Dependency on external resources, namely foreign aid, also affects governments’ formulation of national policy. And finally, mounting adoption in a region alters the risk, benefits, and information associated with a given policy. Methods I use post-war, discrete time data spanning 1950 to 2011 and describing 193 nations’ mental health systems to test these diffusion mechanisms. Results I find that the adoption of mental health policy is highly clustered temporally and spatially. Results provide support that membership in the World Health Organization (WHO), interdependence with neighbors and peers in regional blocs, national income status, and migrant sub-population are responsible for isomorphism. Aid, however, is an insufficient determinant of mental health policy adoption. Conclusion This study examines the extent to which mental, neurological, and substance use disorder are addressed in national and international contexts through the lens of policy diffusion theory.

Berry; David A. Siegel,"Scholars have hypothesized that policy choices by national, state, and local governments often have implications for “location choices” made by residents (e.g., tax policies affect where firms set up business, welfare benefits influence where the poor live, government restaurant smoking restrictions influence where people eat). We develop a spatially explicit strategic theory of policy diffusion driven by intergovernmental competition over residents’ location choices. The theory assumes that governments’ decisions constitute a strategic game in which governments are influenced by their neighbors. We suggest a variety of policy contexts in which the theory is applicable. For one such context—the adoption of lotteries by American states—we use the theory to generate several hypotheses and then test them using event history analysis. The results provide substantial support for the theory and indicate that states compete for lottery business in a much more sophisticated fashion than has been previously recogn...",73,1,232,247,Public economics; Welfare; Variety (cybernetics); Government; Economics; Set (psychology); State (polity); Lottery; Competition (economics); Affect (psychology),,,,,http://myweb.fsu.edu/dsiegel/Research/BBS_JoP_appendix.pdf https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1017/S0022381610000988 https://people.duke.edu/~das76/Research/BBS_JoP_appendix.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022381610000988,,10.1017/s0022381610000988,2064491303,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 004-706-510-680-633; 005-692-270-875-15X; 007-432-265-031-106; 008-956-376-717-77X; 020-849-689-064-23X; 033-969-989-312-301; 034-256-851-138-191; 036-961-749-635-681; 043-532-435-832-250; 044-109-528-071-110; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-420-422-527-87X; 067-490-686-317-462; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 084-367-432-559-544; 084-787-681-556-687; 087-059-939-982-645; 090-394-845-362-302; 091-736-584-918-934; 101-127-387-013-017; 103-533-255-754-581; 137-674-676-505-121; 155-580-858-393-517; 164-856-179-795-144,103,false,,
028-115-158-389-041,Regression-based case selection for pathway analysis of non-linear relationships,2014-07-03,2014,book chapter,Finding Pathways,,Cambridge University Press,,Nicholas Weller; Jeb Barnes,"Introduction In the last chapter, we applied our method to several simple textbook examples, including a hypothetical that posited a linear X1/Y relationship with equifinality (that is, multiple pathways between X1 and Y). In this chapter, we turn to a discussion of case selection in a more complex empirical setting: one that features a non-linear relationship between X1 and Y and the relationship is embedded in a longer causal chain that involves dynamic processes. Under these conditions, researchers must decide where in the causal process to investigate and how to deal with temporal dynamics in their large- and small- N studies. This chapter grapples with these issues by using an example drawn from the policy diffusion literature. As we make clear, in the context of pathway analysis, conceptualizing what is the key explanatory variable and what is the mechanism is not determined by the labels used in prior research or deep philosophical concerns, but rather by practical concerns regarding the relevant research question, how variables are used within the existing empirical research, and data availability. Once the relevant literature is properly understood, our method can be applied in a relatively straightforward manner. International policy diffusion The literature on international policy diffusion is both immense and contested. For purposes of this chapter, therefore, we distinguish between two very different types of studies. One type focuses on the threshold question of whether policy choices spread across political boundaries; that is, whether policy adoption is purely a function of domestic pressures (Berry and Berry 1990; Gray 1973, 1994; Simmons et al. 2008; cf. Volden et al. 2008). The second type of study essentially assumes that policies diffuse across borders, so its focus is on how and under what conditions policy decisions of one country spill over into others. In general, the literature that assumes the existence of diffusion and focuses on how policy diffusion works is more interesting for our purposes, as the search for mechanisms lies at its center (Simmons et al. 2008).",,,69,87,Positive economics; Empirical research; Economics; Variable (computer science); Equifinality; Research question; Context (language use); Simple (philosophy); Function (engineering); Causal chain,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/finding-pathways/regressionbased-case-selection-for-pathway-analysis-of-nonlinear-relationships/8FCE2503DB00F779AAA66E61B704645B,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9781139644501.005,,10.1017/cbo9781139644501.005,2483811746,,0,,0,false,,
028-145-655-531-333,Copy and Paste Lawmaking: The Diusion of Policy Language across American State Legislatures,,2015,,,,,,Joshua M. Jansa,"Why do state lawmakers copy text from other states’ policies? We argue that legislators facing increased time and resource constraints in writing legislation copy more policy language from other states. We test the theory using text analysis and multivariate regression. We find that states copy more text when model legislation is available, particularly on economic issues. However, we find no evidence that institutional features of legislatures, particularly professionalization and term limits, shape legislators’ bill text copying habits. In March 2015, Indiana passed its own version of the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), sparking public outcry. Lawmakers claimed they were attempting in good faith to define the scope of religious protections in the state, while opponents cited the bill as state authorization for business to discriminate against LGBT citizens. A lack of clarity surrounding the bill’s legal language contributed to the controversy. In an op-ed written to the Wall Street Journal, Indiana Governor Mike Pence claimed, “the law is not a ‘license to discriminate,’ either in Indiana or elsewhere. In fact the Religious Freedom Restoration Act reflects federal law, as well as law in 30 states nationwide.” However, critics pointed out that the Indiana bill language was different than other versions of RFRA because it had been “carefully written to make clear that 1) businesses can use it against 2) civil-rights suits brought by individuals” (Epps 2015). Past studies of policy diffusion in the American states have similarly and frequently suffered from an assumption that, in the words of Atlantic contributor and University of Baltimore law professor Garrett Epps, “if a law has a similar title as another law, they must be identical.” As the Indiana case illustrates, it is important for scholars not only to examine which policies diffuse, but what contents of policies diffuse across states (Karch 2007). Policy content diffusion is a timely and important topic for the academic study of state politics, as many journalists covering states have observed a rise in the emulation of bill texts diffusing across states, particularly among policies sponsored by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (e.g. Pilkington and Goldenberg 2013; Suhay 2015). However, little scholarly work has attempted to explain the policy content diffusion process. What factors lead state lawmakers to copy language from other states’ policies? We argue that state legislators face time and resource constraints in writing legislation. We assume that legislators are primarily motivated to win reelection to the legislature or election to higher office, and that their election chances can be improved by spending relatively more time on politics and relatively less time on writing legislation. To save time and resources, legislators copy and paste pre-written texts available to them from other sources, such as other states, interest groups, policy entrepreneurs, and intergovernmental agencies, rather than adapting or writing policies anew.

Kerr,"This article examines Internet policies across the former Soviet region, showing that many of the region’s nondemocratic regimes have adopted similar approaches to control Internet content and use within their territories. The implication that specific control practices are diffusing or being coordinated on within the region is substantiated by close examination of particular approaches and their origins. While these states have made relatively limited use of static content censorship, alternative, less overt controls have spread across the region. Tracing the roles of diffusion and coordination mechanisms, the article demonstrates how, even as overall Internet repression levels have increased, the particular legal frameworks, technical systems, and other control practices used have been deeply influenced by complex regional interdependencies.",12,,21,,The Internet; Stability (learning theory); Political economy; Political science; Interdependence; Control (management); Internet policy; Information security; Censorship; Authoritarianism,,,,,https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/8542/2460,https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/8542/2460,,,2891835463,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

Duffee,"Although there is high concern among politicians, professionals, and the general public with the outcomes of correctional policies, there has been little systematic study of the factors that affect policy adoption. As the federal government steps up its initiatives to influence state and local policy directions, knowledge of policy uptake is increasingly important. Policy diffusion research provides some guidelines for the study of correctional policy adoption, although there are competing theories about the variation in policy adoption. This study explores the adoption of pre-release centers by the states in the 1970s, under a previous federal impetus to promote state policy change. The findings suggest greater support for institutional factors than for economic development factors in the implementation of pre-release centers, but they also suggest that caution is necessary in distinguishing symbolic from programmatic policy initiatives.",20,1,1,20,Public economics; Public policy; Policy analysis; Business; Government; Policy studies; State (polity); Policy initiatives; State policy; Affect (psychology),,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/073401689502000103,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/073401689502000103,,10.1177/073401689502000103,1994060513,,0,009-338-625-881-465; 015-271-876-692-523; 018-089-650-278-096; 029-143-073-048-840; 035-934-731-268-801; 048-220-727-957-599; 049-219-615-824-319; 049-949-645-759-874; 053-325-185-455-093; 061-022-067-711-852; 062-632-095-927-604; 065-846-966-342-891; 066-665-076-365-69X; 067-490-686-317-462; 071-397-493-373-642; 084-022-449-136-835; 084-880-229-369-70X; 085-414-236-021-267; 094-169-045-125-151; 097-416-968-699-086; 100-580-372-997-18X; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-033-243-740-003; 106-168-209-676-048; 108-400-580-357-128; 109-683-532-739-972; 110-805-087-383-901; 113-377-188-742-45X; 129-349-979-139-342; 130-306-524-717-746; 135-628-074-419-154; 151-121-996-817-279; 176-970-616-555-89X; 199-794-643-715-46X,4,false,,

For example, Sweden and Botswana, two nations vastly different across multiple dimensions, both liberalized their telecom sectors. Why did so many countries adopt liberal reforms in such a short period of time? Conventional wisdom highlights the role of global markets and technology, powerful states, global diffusion, and domestic politics. I argue that contrary to these claims, diffusion through key international organizations is the critical and overlooked factor in explaining rapid global convergence of pro-market telecom reforms. Using an original dataset for 189 countries between 1970 and 2003 and event history analysis, I demonstrate that membership in key liberal trading organizations, especially the WTO and the OECD, increases the likelihood that countries will adopt liberal pro-market reforms in telecommunications. These results speak directly to current public policy debates about the reregulation of global markets and bridges the literatures of policy diffusion, institutional design, and regulatory regimes.",32,5,517,537,Public policy; Economics; Globalization; Convergence (economics); Pace; Conventional wisdom; International political economy; Corporate governance; Telecommunications; Politics,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/blarevpol/v_3a32_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a517-537.htm https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ropr.12137/pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ropr.12137/abstract https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/revpol/v32y2015i5p517-537.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ropr.12137,,10.1111/ropr.12137,2117580197,,0,000-243-899-745-656; 000-259-585-621-956; 003-353-649-086-180; 003-958-537-182-970; 005-603-755-641-725; 006-040-995-257-407; 006-410-508-275-76X; 007-276-404-273-390; 008-154-378-710-243; 010-932-514-368-658; 012-276-625-437-513; 012-501-126-712-259; 012-518-993-868-746; 016-487-678-661-127; 017-024-626-490-501; 019-454-920-846-524; 020-181-550-263-923; 022-058-909-319-436; 022-217-436-015-912; 022-512-643-506-628; 023-186-293-184-678; 026-547-457-187-868; 030-889-405-040-535; 031-048-174-556-138; 031-209-326-357-301; 033-013-392-412-442; 033-990-032-399-929; 034-277-783-905-290; 036-315-761-425-306; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-652-068-303-278; 039-835-476-700-784; 041-066-595-218-438; 042-407-516-301-962; 045-185-612-135-034; 045-187-329-541-642; 045-838-248-238-824; 047-653-727-554-316; 047-938-043-298-533; 047-974-215-660-307; 048-146-132-370-77X; 049-618-507-065-544; 049-640-335-145-361; 051-595-487-906-627; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-514-650-599-393; 060-702-041-193-754; 061-611-577-819-324; 063-726-898-437-389; 064-819-427-648-314; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-909-494-409-568; 070-015-922-619-952; 071-846-033-952-37X; 076-059-834-724-990; 076-513-901-044-336; 079-817-596-065-297; 081-118-035-104-953; 084-830-776-635-792; 087-535-931-939-575; 088-993-237-313-315; 091-635-391-361-68X; 094-045-309-313-777; 094-537-715-180-069; 094-873-799-252-527; 095-690-319-837-396; 097-419-955-788-796; 097-644-833-344-936; 100-260-700-143-114; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-305-593-959-400; 107-241-308-443-068; 109-260-244-328-648; 114-134-343-987-319; 115-482-499-323-938; 116-385-391-764-610; 116-396-165-642-803; 117-398-902-985-677; 117-955-392-607-797; 120-240-184-834-644; 121-636-255-103-96X; 121-961-275-008-248; 123-841-240-202-354; 131-076-765-815-326; 133-156-301-938-830; 135-915-786-487-667; 142-998-368-482-353; 145-047-319-889-865; 149-336-012-724-51X; 156-282-630-713-36X; 159-688-835-528-183; 168-608-751-205-241; 169-166-611-619-769; 171-193-158-135-007; 175-387-925-389-501; 176-784-443-724-78X; 180-586-699-727-535; 182-087-251-579-112; 182-899-834-414-84X; 184-936-124-766-712; 186-443-422-205-240; 191-240-549-960-228,5,false,,

Li; Robert Kelchen,"<jats:p>While previous research on higher education policy diffusion often conceptualizes diffusion as occuring across neighboring governments, we conceptualize policy diffusion as also occuring across pairs of governments (dyads) regardless of geographic proximity. We apply both conceptualizations and use survival analysis techniques to examine factors associated with state adoption of performance funding equity metrics. Results show that the proportion of neighbors with equity metrics is unrelated to the likelihood of adopting a metric for either the 2- or 4-year sector, suggesting no evidence of policy diffusion across borders. The directed dyad analysis reveals that states are less likely to adopt a 4-year metric when the other state in the pair already operates a 4-year metric, indicating that states look beyond neighbors in policy avoidance behaviors. Internal state factors such as higher levels of legislative professionalism and greater enrollment of underrepresented minority and low-income students increase the likelihood of policy adoption. A state is less likely to imitate the adoption of 2-year equity metrics in another state when the pair show greater differences in legislative professionalism, minority and low-income student enrollment, income per capita, and income inequality. Our research highlights the utility of quantitatively modeling policy diffusion across governmental units that are distantly located, especially for higher education policy components that are nationally visible.</jats:p>",,,89590482110584,089590482110584,Equity (law); Legislature; Demographic economics; Dyad; Metric (unit); Public economics; Inequality; Economics; Political science; Psychology; Social psychology; Mathematical analysis; Operations management; Mathematics; Law,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08959048211058439,,10.1177/08959048211058439,,,0,001-481-906-279-295; 005-043-834-763-541; 005-183-254-265-858; 005-805-134-751-409; 005-821-384-590-53X; 006-137-636-046-262; 012-422-009-135-645; 013-126-282-071-945; 013-769-809-093-307; 014-448-931-765-428; 014-694-012-786-985; 015-321-339-659-51X; 023-831-104-510-956; 024-106-632-704-329; 024-277-242-294-068; 027-835-981-532-333; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-692-427-359-198; 038-619-779-714-232; 043-413-024-408-20X; 048-828-721-399-034; 055-136-364-928-386; 057-365-325-883-99X; 057-510-885-060-973; 058-133-339-465-995; 061-793-046-506-062; 062-222-159-195-376; 063-040-467-994-945; 065-829-054-116-66X; 073-917-290-485-125; 074-497-866-180-358; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-301-095-145-268; 076-524-400-508-298; 082-932-346-118-749; 083-594-152-084-322; 087-263-391-282-640; 096-362-816-439-456; 096-805-797-627-901; 101-488-954-100-242; 105-814-003-497-463; 112-326-713-911-615; 115-089-873-174-661; 146-286-307-679-38X; 149-297-972-436-92X; 154-314-204-508-516; 158-702-707-738-129; 179-391-844-370-515; 184-567-864-553-172,2,false,,

Exploring the difference in timing of adoption by each state, I examine the determinants of cultural district laws. Following the policy diffusion literature, I test whether there is government, imitation, and learning mechanisms driving the adoption of cultural district laws in the USA.

Structural political science explanations leave gaps in clarifying this diffusion pattern. This paper proposes a theoretical model focusing on the influence of domestic epistemic communities mitigating policy diffusion. Based on a review of HTA institutions in the EU, it proposes a chronological taxonomy of HTA agencies in Europe (the forerunners, the mainstreamers and the non-adopters) and asks why there is such an important East-West divide. The paper discusses theoretical explanations from different literatures, finding unsatisfactory many traditional political science answers such as the degree of centralization of a country’s health system, its financial organization (Bismarckian or Beveridgian), the attitude toward independent regulatory bodies in general, the influence of international actors, or lack of resources. Finally, it suggests cases for empirical testing of the domestic epistemic communities model.",11,3,253,273,Public economics; Empirical research; Health care; Political science; Health technology; Reimbursement; Western europe; Economic growth; Taxonomy (general),,"Decision Making; Diffusion of Innovation; Europe; Health Policy; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Technology Assessment, Biomedical/economics",,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:cup:hecopl:v:11:y:2016:i:03:p:253-273_00 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26670267 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/health-economics-policy-and-law/article/three-worlds-of-health-technology-assessment-explaining-patterns-of-diffusion-of-hta-agencies-in-europe/2611D4749D0D843CF2766E682E5CD169 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26670267 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/hecopl/v11y2016i03p253-273_00.html https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S1744133115000444,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1744133115000444,26670267,10.1017/s1744133115000444,2220962089,,0,000-092-755-349-640; 000-811-425-089-872; 002-319-964-789-980; 003-319-264-431-829; 004-180-176-377-538; 006-722-686-316-360; 008-178-848-433-057; 011-852-238-048-477; 011-895-688-094-665; 014-213-733-649-331; 019-181-973-688-127; 021-216-291-636-927; 022-615-159-330-589; 028-355-372-379-859; 028-384-316-849-089; 034-038-074-144-240; 035-663-607-093-600; 038-010-957-927-290; 039-318-000-420-191; 040-525-760-009-087; 040-565-257-699-822; 041-458-809-653-287; 041-752-210-071-704; 041-932-908-087-888; 050-274-654-059-514; 051-275-519-215-060; 051-337-902-379-667; 054-420-035-999-855; 054-702-575-374-798; 055-835-851-453-894; 061-211-327-311-971; 066-021-651-028-494; 067-121-006-432-261; 073-674-938-319-071; 077-490-343-615-137; 083-982-886-904-769; 087-534-434-850-399; 089-781-590-016-700; 092-798-917-703-895; 093-190-746-631-057; 105-402-236-379-344; 115-667-337-333-237; 115-720-910-742-536; 125-081-371-834-611; 132-357-015-993-171; 132-767-425-976-595; 137-566-792-771-074; 147-038-563-856-625; 148-909-643-733-489; 149-915-536-660-103; 151-957-596-917-668; 170-278-088-611-683; 173-969-860-278-954; 174-760-309-657-062; 185-022-874-564-293,24,false,,

First, early policy adoptions must occur through direct democracy so that horizontal diffusion results when those past adoptions by the I&R process lead to future adoptions.

The findings refute some previously held assumptions about state judicial reform and in doing so provide insight for policy scholars interested in the role organized interests play in institutional reform.",29,,135,151,Professional association; Political science; State (polity); Workload; Judicial reform; Public administration,,,,,https://journals.shareok.org/arp/article/view/274 https://journals.shareok.org/arp/article/download/274/251,http://dx.doi.org/10.15763/issn.2374-7781.2008.29.0.135-151,,10.15763/issn.2374-7781.2008.29.0.135-151,2516427523,,0,002-956-932-479-445; 003-592-471-884-916; 005-241-714-667-587; 005-503-339-286-965; 006-282-272-395-98X; 006-980-105-387-34X; 008-205-318-579-56X; 015-591-021-271-179; 017-220-985-817-674; 032-164-929-841-901; 034-939-001-565-085; 058-903-156-385-886; 062-777-472-918-605; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 079-596-135-517-354; 079-775-104-899-373; 081-060-384-134-465; 083-615-940-574-365; 084-787-681-556-687; 088-137-997-391-20X; 092-715-063-536-045; 100-193-327-930-816; 121-699-289-709-271; 132-993-707-031-798; 148-460-439-813-652; 149-407-118-840-717; 154-228-278-302-026; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-076-040-775-567; 170-407-103-992-065; 181-645-821-290-677,1,true,cc-by-nc-sa,hybrid

DeMora; Loren Collingwood; Adriana Ninci,"<jats:p>In recent years scholarship has drawn attention to the role of large multi-issue interest groups in policy networks and in public policy diffusion. This paper develops this field of study by demonstrating empirically the leverage of the ‘sustained organisational influence’ theory of policy diffusion. Specifically, it focuses on the role of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in diffusing the Stand Your Ground policy across US state legislatures. By comparing ALEC’s template policy to bills introduced and legislation subsequently enacted within state legislatures, we demonstrate that ALEC has positioned itself as a ‘super interest group’, exerting sustained organisational influence across an expanding number of states. In doing so, this paper moves theory beyond the typical advocacy coalition framework that implicitly assumes policymaking occurs discretely among specialists on an issue-by-issue basis. It also highlights the democratic implications of the role of super interest groups in shaping policy behind the scenes.</jats:p>",47,4,513,541,Public policy; Diffusion (business); Political science; International economics,,,,,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/pap/2019/00000047/00000004/art00001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1332/030557319x15659214258414,,10.1332/030557319x15659214258414,2973657099,,0,000-247-159-677-06X; 015-765-163-150-580; 016-781-352-160-530; 016-904-650-812-696; 021-686-198-002-985; 034-885-191-890-792; 042-655-523-581-416; 048-221-626-453-871; 050-082-471-457-812; 058-071-798-060-611; 060-419-301-931-423; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-219-906-651-855; 070-837-126-426-407; 076-240-693-922-091; 079-405-753-659-46X; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-787-681-556-687; 086-987-338-587-75X; 091-530-685-409-932; 097-827-159-698-055; 101-127-387-013-017; 133-615-869-460-390; 136-488-899-892-40X; 157-253-057-911-454; 165-842-494-594-827; 175-305-779-508-67X; 186-816-093-779-065; 187-109-680-672-207; 196-328-395-779-570,2,false,,

Shipan; Bruno Wüest,"Policy diffusion means that policy choices in one unit (such as states, cantons, and cities) are influenced by the policy choices of other units. This idea has been studied extensively in several social sciences and, within political science, in subfields such as international relations, American federalism, and public policy. While scholars have demonstrated convincingly that policy diffusion is a real and important phenomenon, much less is known about why and exactly how policies diffuse. We argue that this condition is due to the inherent limitations of existing research designs. This paper puts forward a new approach based on automated frame analysis. Theoretically, the paper focuses on how the perception of policy problems and solutions changes as a result of the adoption of policies elsewhere. We apply this approach to the spread of smoking bans among US states and Swiss cantons. Preliminary results from an analysis of thirteen American newspapers shows that media coverage intensifies when major legislation and illustrates how it prioritizes different consequences of smoking bans, such health, economic fallout for businesses, and enforcement issues.",,,,,Public economics; Public policy; Frame analysis; Content analysis; Political science; Legislation; Enforcement; International relations; Unit (housing); Federalism,,,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/143883/1/BW_Conf.13-APSA-Conference-Paper-2014.pdf https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/143883/ http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/143883/1/BW_Conf.13-APSA-Conference-Paper-2014.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5167/uzh-143883,,10.5167/uzh-143883,2779937497,,0,,2,true,,

Marshall,"Since the 1970s, expressions of state concern over low fertility have greatly increased among wealthier countries. This study asks to what extent this increase is explained by demographic factors, national-level economic and political factors, and processes of international diffusion and changing international norms. Analyses integrate the world polity literature on global policy diffusion with a social problems approach to examine international diffusion of state concern among more powerful members of the world polity, a process that can produce changes in international policy consensus. Comparisons of the characteristics of states that do and do not express concern over low fertility find that among wealthier ""first-world"" countries, state concern has become more responsive to fertility rates: fertility rates are not significantly associated with concern early in the study period, but are strongly associated with concern later in the study period. There is no evidence that integration into the world polity is associated with concern in these countries, and some evidence that less integrated countries are more likely to express concern, suggesting that processes shaping the diffusion of state concern may differ from those identified as shaping policy diffusion in the existing literature. Among ""second-world"" former Eastern bloc countries, different patterns of associations reflect different political histories: concern is associated only with demographic factors, with no significant change in this association over time.",93,4,1541,1566,Economics; State (polity); Eastern Bloc; Polity; Global policy; Low fertility; Total fertility rate; Development economics; Economic growth; Social issues; Politics,,,,NICHD NIH HHS (R24 HD041028) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (T32 HD007339) United States,https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/93/4/1541/2332238/ http://muse.jhu.edu/article/581911/pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26213421/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26213421 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4512176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sf/sov060,26213421,10.1093/sf/sov060,2098982256,PMC4512176,0,000-038-230-810-935; 000-375-941-338-996; 002-351-792-759-995; 009-804-320-904-609; 014-145-446-402-502; 021-435-730-479-995; 027-206-956-903-807; 027-952-834-053-159; 029-015-677-085-89X; 037-161-292-403-573; 042-653-076-059-159; 046-036-565-011-588; 046-950-955-615-162; 050-705-566-565-013; 053-577-944-625-104; 054-039-379-740-887; 055-541-702-594-681; 064-980-246-016-490; 070-718-829-904-733; 071-846-033-952-37X; 076-140-186-030-226; 080-287-029-959-956; 081-103-336-361-417; 085-808-624-851-272; 087-518-082-631-458; 087-727-714-728-639; 095-551-424-707-526; 110-413-102-497-008; 113-113-699-423-769; 115-716-554-714-093; 116-724-091-745-024; 120-960-163-160-201; 125-408-655-263-293; 131-683-343-850-599; 135-891-357-852-810; 143-057-741-673-804; 155-670-819-340-868; 160-440-379-910-413; 194-483-965-142-078,3,true,,green
030-893-628-557-445,Unpacking Policy Diffusion: A Textual Analysis of Refugee and Population Policies Across African Countries,,2013,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Rachel Sullivan Robinson; Kate Tennis,"Policy diffusion refers to the sequential adoption of similar policies, programs, or bureaucratic structures by countries around the world. Sociologists and political scientists have generally found such adoptions to be more strongly patterned by countries connections to the world polity through international governmental and nongovernmental organizations than by characteristics of countries themselves. Despite the predictive power of such connections, this research can be criticized on two fronts. First, there is a great deal of slippage regarding the meaning of diffusion and the object that diffuses. Second, policies do not always diffuse from the core to the periphery because countries of the core have not always themselves adopted the policy or program in question. To address these criticisms, we conduct a textual analysis of the spread of two types of demographically oriented policiesthose to slow population growth and those to manage refugeesamong African countries. Our main findings include: (1) there is an increase in textual similarity over time, particularly after key international events; (2) policies written close to one another in time are more textually similar; (3) there is evidence for periphery-to-core diffusion for population policies; and (4) there is not much diffusion within regions.",,,,,Refugee; Political science; Predictive power; Polity; Population; Development economics; Bureaucracy; Meaning (linguistics); Population growth; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2237125,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2237125,,,2473778792,,0,,0,false,,

High growth rates and technological advances have typically coincided with both strong VC market activity and state support of equity financing. This, however, has not been the case in Vietnam. In this article a policy diffusion framework is used to investigate the international and domestic origins of Vietnam’s nascent VC policies, and how they became part of the agenda of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) as credit-based, rather than equity-based, solutions. The article argues that Vietnam’s heterodox approach to VC policy results from both external forces from donors and from domestic factors.

By using the unique variations in the provision of vaccination subsidies in Japan, we assess how vaccination policies in a local government are affected by the decisions of neighboring governments. We find that the provision of vaccination subsidies is positively correlated with the decisions of neighboring localities. Moreover, a correlation is found with neighboring municipalities within the same prefecture but not with those in surrounding prefectures, indicating that the correlations are likely to arise because of mimicking behavior among localities within a prefecture. Our results show that vaccination policies tend to be formed following neighboring municipalities and do not necessarily aim to optimize community health, thus questioning the autonomy of local government authorities regarding vaccination policies.",28,2,299,310,Business; Externality; Interdependence; Vaccination; Community health; Local government; Development economics; Autonomy; Subsidy,externalities; policy diffusion; spatial Durbin model; vaccination subsidies; yardstick competition,"Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Financing, Government/statistics & numerical data; Health Policy/economics; Humans; Japan; Local Government; Models, Econometric; Papillomavirus Vaccines/economics; Vaccination/economics; Vaccines/economics",Papillomavirus Vaccines; Vaccines,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science International; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (16H03564) International,https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/hlthec/v28y2019i2p299-310.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hec.3845 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30511394 https://keio.pure.elsevier.com/ja/publications/interdependency-in-vaccination-policies-among-japanese-municipali,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.3845,30511394,10.1002/hec.3845,2902748250,,0,000-472-418-844-602; 000-810-335-991-171; 003-095-176-503-01X; 005-093-813-072-333; 005-717-743-013-292; 008-414-193-659-208; 011-557-799-147-844; 017-190-036-449-043; 021-993-332-704-356; 026-034-907-362-624; 027-288-774-275-290; 032-089-422-623-115; 036-270-568-284-808; 036-728-135-533-815; 037-273-915-637-226; 037-985-197-918-343; 038-398-464-151-811; 040-117-832-363-809; 041-814-414-343-67X; 042-182-115-659-969; 042-925-687-881-340; 043-712-543-800-422; 046-913-961-991-946; 046-948-159-972-799; 048-046-018-342-654; 053-791-499-445-515; 054-789-439-578-31X; 057-942-706-927-05X; 060-482-316-072-686; 069-990-322-932-29X; 071-074-859-133-314; 071-122-260-989-769; 074-947-042-439-852; 087-903-893-862-568; 092-549-100-400-323; 095-115-886-347-042; 098-783-212-829-339; 102-949-081-922-794; 106-985-260-310-500; 110-010-539-106-595; 117-530-616-284-840; 118-931-001-531-095; 129-325-875-246-69X; 140-736-526-491-974; 170-031-736-759-615; 189-316-025-994-618,0,false,,

Using an original, large-N panel dataset for the period from 1998 to 2014, we show that the configuration of the local political economy is an important driver of financialization processes: a Labour Party majority as well as fiscal and economic stress make it more likely that councils adopt risky financial instruments. As the use of financial innovations has also diffused geographically, policy diffusion impacts local governments as well. Highlighting the conditional effect of finance sector power, which only increases the use of financial innovations in very large councils, as well as the temporal dimension of fiscal and economic stress, we create ample avenues for further research",15,2,370,387,Diffusion (business); Political economy; Economics; Local government; Financialization; Partisan politics,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rego.12285 https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/rego.12285,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rego.12285,,10.1111/rego.12285,2979578818,,0,000-491-884-657-568; 000-911-723-166-184; 001-367-136-082-787; 001-481-906-279-295; 002-046-375-112-655; 003-084-974-852-384; 005-033-533-704-194; 006-168-480-595-717; 007-035-690-649-24X; 012-476-153-805-475; 013-840-065-651-677; 015-081-868-584-998; 015-822-100-915-409; 017-397-981-692-898; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-421-133-986-973; 020-886-737-283-537; 023-672-511-213-267; 024-213-878-587-058; 025-072-028-983-88X; 025-715-481-473-77X; 025-989-417-461-30X; 031-462-024-978-793; 032-781-724-169-65X; 034-911-187-942-349; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-233-027-170-118; 040-669-665-528-199; 042-145-181-183-708; 042-170-493-291-809; 043-547-850-265-638; 046-368-311-446-670; 046-819-081-484-945; 048-075-739-051-42X; 050-981-488-224-141; 051-563-283-713-00X; 054-174-435-749-31X; 054-765-543-704-543; 057-774-586-847-134; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-859-459-740-253; 059-576-981-134-500; 061-373-791-267-531; 061-962-268-521-043; 065-311-318-531-124; 065-829-054-116-66X; 066-141-735-734-026; 066-498-744-009-995; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-803-621-029-82X; 071-192-280-880-975; 072-131-155-619-222; 075-688-160-192-953; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-783-738-119-061; 079-431-541-601-150; 080-285-338-290-10X; 080-923-150-377-557; 084-439-721-812-26X; 085-130-558-063-65X; 085-972-498-982-216; 088-660-124-412-645; 088-993-237-313-315; 097-952-319-462-125; 106-093-290-086-673; 112-238-569-307-615; 112-899-994-763-150; 115-618-530-770-745; 121-705-908-904-649; 122-079-143-933-181; 129-038-185-433-517; 130-143-037-606-105; 130-755-790-967-178; 131-900-393-723-959; 135-754-717-063-364; 140-980-900-069-963; 154-314-204-508-516; 155-144-465-861-390; 155-145-802-522-598; 155-580-858-393-517; 160-875-639-496-451; 174-550-438-327-304; 180-301-273-084-067,8,true,cc-by,hybrid

In response, nations turned to different forms of social distancing policies to reduce the spread of the virus. These policies were implemented globally, proving as contagious as the virus they are meant to prevent. Yet, variation in their implementation invites questions as to how and why countries adopt social distancing policies, and whether the causal mechanisms driving these policy adoptions are based on internal resources and problem conditions or other external factors such as conditions in other countries. We leverage daily changes in international social distancing policies to understand the impacts of problem characteristics, institutional and economic context, and peer effects on social distancing policy adoption. Using fixed-effects models on an international panel of daily data from 2020, we find that peer effects, particularly mimicry of geographic neighbors, political peers, and language agnates drive policy diffusion and shape countries' policy choices.",40,1,36,62,Social distance; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Political science; Leverage (statistics); Politics; Context (archaeology); Welfare economics; Development economics; Economics; Geography; Law; Medicine; Disease; Archaeology; Pathology; Machine learning; Computer science; Infectious disease (medical specialty),COVID‐19; emulation; peer effects; policy diffusion; policy mimicry,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ropr.12487,35942305,10.1111/ropr.12487,,PMC9347821,0,000-314-829-596-064; 001-475-289-518-359; 003-592-471-884-916; 005-765-886-973-414; 006-173-925-263-309; 006-282-272-395-98X; 006-722-686-316-360; 009-071-670-816-937; 010-838-733-162-480; 013-731-270-122-755; 014-694-012-786-985; 015-292-461-129-838; 016-379-525-554-840; 017-083-468-555-639; 018-454-798-334-448; 022-303-939-580-092; 023-074-963-514-802; 027-475-395-959-514; 027-835-981-532-333; 030-990-398-926-851; 031-437-440-063-897; 032-049-133-589-428; 035-261-961-935-32X; 037-093-910-834-572; 037-125-003-184-418; 037-649-150-952-373; 038-818-459-512-182; 039-429-622-352-340; 040-082-648-792-366; 043-071-765-404-719; 044-588-921-445-167; 046-228-929-552-921; 047-100-096-242-649; 047-385-352-717-976; 047-963-511-113-718; 049-792-702-140-62X; 050-671-315-820-339; 051-563-283-713-00X; 052-723-818-069-06X; 057-381-415-483-033; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-668-244-624-560; 060-881-928-065-821; 061-793-046-506-062; 062-849-708-836-500; 064-825-631-396-530; 064-916-060-149-336; 066-302-642-761-441; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-104-397-893-621; 070-194-236-908-398; 073-187-357-658-640; 074-128-358-343-524; 075-485-918-396-82X; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-959-398-708-786; 077-579-405-197-462; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-705-757-170-703; 084-787-681-556-687; 084-879-622-725-768; 085-606-476-855-902; 087-142-487-479-527; 088-919-425-365-248; 089-224-504-410-76X; 093-190-746-631-057; 096-517-829-236-651; 096-544-697-212-968; 098-241-276-361-679; 098-353-841-797-309; 101-488-954-100-242; 104-851-290-618-569; 106-138-750-209-934; 115-482-499-323-938; 117-005-511-150-947; 118-736-550-659-004; 123-117-445-164-323; 124-530-191-148-790; 125-268-617-755-543; 128-412-145-076-659; 129-473-399-920-245; 133-615-869-460-390; 135-581-724-835-200; 136-248-142-014-936; 142-847-113-114-091; 147-081-027-472-293; 148-092-457-460-073; 155-580-858-393-517; 156-120-996-742-091; 158-687-843-782-885; 158-752-833-317-654; 173-662-038-627-64X; 178-929-602-469-825,2,true,,green

Guenther,"Gender mainstreaming emerged on the European policy scene in the mid-1990s as an innovative and controversial policy tool for reducing gender inequalities. The European Union seeks to propagate the practice of gender mainstreaming both within EU institutions and among member states. Feminist scholars and policy elites have discussed and debated gender mainstreaming widely but have yet to consider how local feminist activists, who could play a central role in diffusing gender mainstreaming, understand, interpret, and respond to this agenda. This article examines whether and why local feminist movements in two cities in eastern Germany adopt gender mainstreaming into their advocacy agendas.

Though these regulations were first largely inspired by the European Union policy models, each country gradually developed more autonomy, individually tailoring their regulatory frameworks overtime. The case of Universal Service Obligation (USO) policies show that while Jordan remained aligned with the European Union, Moroccan policy-makers diverged from the European Union by adopting alternative policies, inspired by the Latin American reverse-auction models. Research focusing on Euro-Mediterranean regulatory contexts commonly expect neighbouring countries to converge with EU regulatory models. Yet, borrowing on policy diffusion literature and specifically the mechanisms of learning and imitation, this article shows that policy-takers intentionally decided on the (non)adoption of USO policies.

The article examines three exploratory hypotheses. The first hypothesis considers that the different ERMIs (Alps, Pyrenees, Jura, Carpathian, Balkan Mountains, Dinaric Arc, Caucasus) can be compared, distinguished, and classified using the FRS approach. The second hypothesis addresses the relationship between the degree to which ERMIs correspond to an ideal-type FRS and their role and position within policy diffusion processes. We suggest that the more an ERMI corresponds to an ideal-type FRS, the more important is its role in diffusion processes. The third hypothesis focuses on the relationship between the degree of formalization and institutionalization of ERMIs and their role in policy diffusion processes. We argue that the more and the earlier an ERMI is “formalized” and “institutionalized” in a clear and robust way as a “mature” FRS, the more important its role, and the more central its position, in diffusion processes. This article is a very first attempt to link FRS and policy diffusion concepts. As such it seeks to assess the link's feasibility and relevance, rather than a definitive empirical (in)validation of the three hypotheses.",49,,8,20,Diffusion (business); Regional science; Political science; Position (finance),,,,"Swiss National Science Foundation; GLO-RETE: Globalization and re-territorialization of environmental initiatives in Central Europe: stakeholders, narratives, images; Swiss Network for International Studies",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901115000064 https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:55548 https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_696ECC122B36 https://core.ac.uk/display/84059618,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2015.01.004,,10.1016/j.envsci.2015.01.004,2007851610,,0,003-412-189-797-295; 005-249-461-623-469; 007-116-826-562-683; 008-219-448-967-904; 008-414-059-072-131; 016-088-163-159-287; 019-813-945-281-728; 021-968-002-240-259; 042-178-112-531-343; 045-090-127-016-160; 050-404-154-950-792; 051-662-367-342-457; 067-341-125-020-782; 072-050-889-156-71X; 075-428-805-584-444; 077-783-919-314-847; 077-945-151-328-246; 093-048-053-894-033; 098-833-841-467-10X; 102-360-042-936-227; 103-121-505-342-344; 108-166-013-954-847; 108-747-030-444-457; 110-309-926-544-567; 144-875-835-229-211; 151-339-055-426-534; 165-966-298-815-906; 172-070-974-127-247; 179-160-885-558-700; 197-253-114-478-935,9,true,,green
033-155-110-529-313,Beyond special circumstances: climate change policy in Turkey 1992–2015,2016-03-07,2016,journal article,WIREs Climate Change,17577780; 17577799,Wiley,United States,Ethemcan Turhan; Semra Cerit Mazlum; Ümit Şahin; Alevgul H. Sorman; A. Cem Gündoğan,"The contours of Turkey's climate policy have remained almost intact over the past two decades. Being an Annex I party without any mitigation commitments, Turkey maintains a peculiar position under UNFCCC. Subsequent to 12 years of delay in signing both the Framework Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, Turkey had the highest rate of increase in greenhouse gas emissions among the Annex I countries with 110.4% upsurge in the period 1990 and 2013. Yet with the new climate regime now in place, the country's mitigation pledges fall short of expectations both in terms of realistic projections and its ambition to step up in the post-2020 period. Climate policies in Turkey, an EU candidate and OECD founding member with a growing economy, remain under-investigated. Although the country has a wide range of policies and institutions in place, it shows limited progress in addressing climate change. Based on evidence from the literature, we observe that climate policies operationalize in Turkey insofar as they do not directly confront developmental ambitions, leaving policy diffusion with limited success. To provide a historic overview, we focus on climate policy development, actors, processes, and contemporary trends. Evidence shows that these are highly ridden with the politics of special circumstances: a notion that Turkey employs to refrain from bindings commitments. In order to go beyond special circumstances discourse, we argue the need for a bold policy shift in Turkey, a country subject to adverse impacts of climate change and high-carbon lock-in risk due to development policy preferences.

The Torch Programme's procedural practices challenge widely shared assumptions about the dirigiste character of Chinese innovation policy. It combines centralized definition of programme objectives with extensive local implementation experiments. As three case studies demonstrate, bottom-up policy innovations are effectively fed back into national programme adjustments and into horizontal policy diffusion. The array of organizational patterns and promotional instruments that emerges from competitive “experimentation under the shadow of hierarchy” (ESH) goes way beyond what could have been initiated from top down.

Starting with France in 2010, nationwide bans on full-face Muslim veils were also adopted in Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands. Despite some controversy, bans on Muslim veils were supported overwhelmingly by political parties and the public, were rooted on several accounts, and advocated by contrasting political ideologies. From the left, veil bans were justified by the concept of secularism or the exclusion of religion from the public sphere, and by the fact that these bans served to safeguard women's rights. From the right, Muslim veils were regarded as a symbol of Islamic fundamentalism and were thus a threat to national/regional security. In addition, legal bans were justified on the basis of cultural integration or assimilation of minorities to Western values and traditions, which in its extreme form may be interpreted as Islamophobia. (3) This paper will examine the diffusion of full-face Muslim veil-ban laws in France, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands and will employ both external and internal determinants to explain this process. In the first case, it will examine factors that have influenced Western Europe systemically including immigration of people of Muslim origin; issues of regional/national security, particularly since 9/11; and a greater sense of a common European identity or Europeanism. Internally, this paper will analyze the political and social forces (political parties, institutions, and civil society) that have contributed to the adoption of policies in these four Western European countries. Overall, this integrative approach will shed light on how the external environment helped shape the internal policy-making processes in some countries but not in others. Innovation-Diffusion Frameworks: Internal and External Determinants Among political scientists generally, policy diffusion is a well-known contemporary approach for studying public policy, as demonstrated in Paul Sabatier's Theories of Policy Process. Over time, the framework has been refined both conceptually and methodologically. In the fifth edition of Diffusion of Innovations, Everett Rogers defines diffusion as a process in which members of a social system communicate innovations (2003:11). Policy diffusion typically refers to the process by which policymakers learn from the experiences of others and attempt to imitate their innovations or avoid them (Guenther 2008:58). This process ""involves a set of assumptions about the nature of systems, how they interact, and how the environmental context will affect the units studied"" (Starr 1991:367). The framework also examines how policy spreads from one country to another, and involves geographic and other structural factors to help explain it (Freeman & Tester 1996:13). Emanuel Adler (1991:51) observes that ""there is a dynamic relationship between historical and structural forces that helps explain the nature of the diffusion of values."" Adler identifies this dynamic process as ""cognitive evolution."" The author suggests that because ""our ideas, beliefs, and behaviors are learned from other people,"" collective learning will be closely related to the ability of groups to convey their experiences to other groups. As to the level of analysis, earlier works on diffusion showed a divide between scholars that identified internal factors as critical in policy diffusion and those who placed greater weight on external influences or the contagion effect of diffusion (Gray 1994, McClendon and Hearn 2006). Yet, recent literature suggests that a comprehensive approach to studying the diffusion of norms, values and policy should include a combination of external and internal determinants, bridging the artificial gap between what occurs within a state and outside of it (True and Mintrom 2001, Mintrom and Vegari 1991). …",16,2,15,29,Public policy; Political economy; Sociology; Ideology; Law; Europeanism; Level of analysis; Public sphere; Diffusion of innovations; Civil society; Politics,,,,,https://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol16/iss2/2/ https://paperity.org/p/84385519/veil-bans-in-western-europe-interpreting-policy-diffusion https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-413779429/veil-bans-in-western-europe-interpreting-policy-diffusion https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1781&context=jiws,https://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol16/iss2/2/,,,2122902127,,0,017-559-575-177-873; 024-059-255-948-491; 029-794-495-749-291; 032-113-160-489-426; 032-164-929-841-901; 047-126-929-405-154; 047-812-993-541-791; 062-222-159-195-376; 068-905-690-168-04X; 082-108-431-047-839; 098-249-554-376-341; 104-169-480-070-66X; 136-730-340-297-506; 138-198-729-336-459; 148-460-439-813-652; 163-637-734-144-951; 176-101-704-319-761; 187-186-537-245-164,2,false,,

Summary and conclusion.%%%%Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) have increasingly been recognised as a key strategic policy for delivering public infrastructure services in developing countries. PPPs as an important part of the effort of the governments in developing countries are also expected to reduce the burdens on their budgets and excessive debt. With proper management controls, a PPP could further generate efficiency, effectiveness, innovations, and achieve value for money objective in the delivery of public services. However, the progress of PPPs in developing countries has been slow, often failing to achieve value for money objective. In many occasions, PPPs in these countries were either held up or terminated before proceeding to the physical development stage. The aim of this thesis is to examine the use of management control systems by public partners to minimise risk associated with PPPs with special reference to Sri Lanka. The thesis adopts ?thesis by publication? format and includes three research papers with specific objectives. The study finds that public partners use control archetypes, namely market, bureaucratic and clan, with control strategies, namely performance evaluation and trust, to minimise relational risk and performance risk in different combinations in different phases of PPPs. The study also reveals that while five contingent factors suggested by transaction cost economic theory are highly relevant in the context of PPPs in Sri Lanka, the institutional environment and the power differential also influence public partners? choice between various control archetypes. Further, the thesis provides evidence suggesting that the PPP policy innovated in industrialised countries was diffused into Sri Lanka with coercion from international aid organisations (IAOs) through the conditionality attached to financial assistance. The findings of the study contribute to literatures on PPPs, public policy, and new public management in general and management control in particular. The findings also have implications for governments in developing countries, IAOs, managers in both public sector and private sector organisations.%%%%%%%%xiv, 254 p. ill",,,,,Public economics; Public policy; Private sector; Business; Public sector; Public infrastructure; Conditionality; Management control system; New public management; Developing country,,,,,http://www.researchonline.mq.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/mq:31322/SOURCE1,http://www.researchonline.mq.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/mq:31322/SOURCE1,,,2789208172,,0,,0,false,,

Taylor; Daniel C. Lewis; Matthew L. Jacobsmeier; Brian S. DiSarro,"This article sheds new light on policy diffusion by exploring policy complexity in state-level lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) antidiscrimination policies. The multiple component event history approach taken in this research allows for the concurrent study of both policy content and the factors that affect policy adoption. Results reveal that the factors influencing policy adoption vary depending on both the content and scope of the policy in question. In addition to addressing laws that protect gay people from discrimination, this article is one of the first studies in the political science and policy literature to empirically investigate the spread of transgender-inclusive laws. Despite combined advocacy and public conflation of identities, gay and transgender-inclusive laws appear to be influenced by different internal and external factors.",12,1,75,98,Public policy; Conflation; Political science; Law; Policy studies; Content (Freudian dream analysis); Transgender; Lesbian; Scope (project management); Affect (psychology),,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532440011433589 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/abs/content-and-complexity-in-policy-reinvention-and-diffusion-gay-and-transgenderinclusive-laws-against-discrimination/04021D758A55FEC1026441F8D2964A8D http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532440011433589,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532440011433589,,10.1177/1532440011433589,2025612522,,0,003-592-471-884-916; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-615-859-352-82X; 005-692-270-875-15X; 010-221-323-940-921; 010-374-580-211-698; 014-421-422-536-192; 016-592-130-610-070; 018-119-069-297-706; 018-385-878-591-376; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-419-031-338-034; 025-173-231-763-228; 025-984-821-082-018; 027-111-025-869-530; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-969-989-312-301; 034-925-616-576-381; 035-297-063-857-635; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-680-049-182-281; 043-418-719-602-52X; 044-045-984-053-178; 048-032-418-389-462; 048-616-037-883-642; 048-749-265-167-655; 050-082-471-457-812; 053-983-312-519-622; 057-066-948-879-540; 059-274-660-526-403; 066-196-175-938-562; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-886-965-483-619; 072-826-532-600-502; 073-539-048-831-696; 075-668-766-785-78X; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-544-962-568-939; 084-154-879-306-982; 085-835-075-480-379; 098-317-151-036-205; 100-028-270-462-10X; 101-261-130-767-072; 106-352-974-752-749; 108-815-298-846-192; 115-631-793-638-558; 117-662-522-106-87X; 119-739-246-375-306; 122-359-483-385-800; 134-300-624-191-268; 146-245-242-077-685; 155-580-858-393-517; 173-256-407-940-663; 179-549-164-047-279; 180-187-712-085-074; 183-079-321-581-821; 192-598-780-208-832; 193-246-779-706-655,63,false,,

We draw on research in agenda setting and policy diffusion to explore the determinants of public health attention in the fifty American states. We find that intergovernmental influence has a strong and consistent influence over state attention to tobacco and vaccines from 1990 to 2010. While national attention to tobacco or vaccines also sparks attention in the states, this effect is smaller than the internal impact of gubernatorial attention and the horizontal influence of neighboring state attention. We find some support that problem severity matters; however, these results are highly dependent on the measures used. Finally, we find no evidence that interest groups influence the attention that states pay to tobacco or vaccines.

Second, it addresses the concept of ‘negative lesson-drawing’ as well as the role of interlocutors who complicate policy transfer processes between A and B. Third, the idea of ‘transfer’ as a neat linear transmission of an intact policy approach or tool is criticised by drawing attention to the extensiveness of hybridity, synthesis, adaptation and ‘localisation’. Finally, the article concludes that policy ‘translation’ is a better conceptual framework for comprehending and valorising the learning and policy innovations that come with the trial and error inherent in policy-making. This entails an abandonment of perceptions of one-way linear processes of country ‘A’ sending policy to ‘B’ that characterises many policy transfer approaches to a stronger analytical focus on importing countries that translate policies.",45,1,55,70,Positive economics; Policy analysis; Conceptual framework; Economics; Policy transfer; Bricolage; Hybridity; Abandonment (legal); Experimentalism; Imperfect; Public administration,,,,,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/pap/2017/00000045/00000001/art00004 https://researchprofiles.canberra.edu.au/en/publications/understanding-the-transfer-of-policy-failure-bricolage-experiment http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/80575/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1332/030557316x14748914098041,,10.1332/030557316x14748914098041,2587066638,,0,,112,true,cc-by,green

Leaning on the policy diffusion literature, this article argues that the more voters support deeper European integration, the more likely cantonal governments are to restrict tobacco advertising. Policymakers use voters’ support for more European integration as a signal that they support regulatory policies that are strongly associated with the European Union (EU) in the political and media debate, such as tobacco advertisement bans. This effect ought to be especially strong in the absence of adverse economic interests, such as the presence of the tobacco industry. To buttress these claims, the present article uses statistical analysis, specifically event-history analysis. Apart from the insights about Swiss tobacco control policy, this article contributes to our understanding of indirect EU influence on cantonal policymaking and policy diffusion.",37,2,113,142,Advertising; Political science; European integration; restrict; Europeanisation; Tobacco control; Tobacco industry; European union; Statistical analysis; Politics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/jnlpup/v37y2017i02p113-142_00.html https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_B681B34AB69D https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-public-policy/article/europeanisation-beyond-the-european-union-tobacco-advertisement-restrictions-in-swiss-cantons/7B624258052399A558DA767DE3817AD9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0143814x16000167,,10.1017/s0143814x16000167,2515732604,,0,001-367-136-082-787; 002-456-713-898-737; 002-557-636-257-591; 003-054-058-203-779; 004-555-284-713-496; 005-477-799-963-940; 005-690-882-396-409; 006-186-114-454-614; 006-318-776-911-804; 008-064-984-084-378; 008-503-333-464-248; 011-307-700-432-249; 011-659-464-522-304; 012-368-918-822-333; 014-407-092-366-643; 014-998-066-812-811; 015-771-332-035-761; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-454-394-997-17X; 020-316-722-178-246; 023-672-511-213-267; 023-843-404-656-218; 024-783-614-394-601; 025-112-618-417-304; 026-591-558-832-633; 027-761-420-521-926; 028-602-054-693-741; 029-515-235-558-072; 029-677-219-633-089; 029-925-924-033-687; 030-530-785-536-071; 030-588-966-762-280; 032-555-386-505-36X; 034-069-922-768-163; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-905-990-288-894; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-064-861-695-293; 041-576-896-343-160; 043-547-850-265-638; 044-014-360-377-076; 044-984-260-075-860; 047-137-876-262-56X; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-274-654-059-514; 057-304-126-803-126; 058-071-798-060-611; 060-730-567-807-800; 061-941-790-284-228; 062-385-928-184-53X; 062-440-681-834-746; 064-946-843-863-779; 065-715-250-691-180; 067-163-960-502-364; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-521-008-015-559; 068-727-135-920-58X; 069-203-712-676-708; 069-910-992-767-489; 070-439-295-045-214; 071-338-903-998-064; 072-776-278-295-086; 074-164-791-184-956; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 079-202-768-341-18X; 079-538-187-066-713; 080-285-338-290-10X; 082-022-397-578-38X; 083-128-427-871-272; 085-587-780-076-136; 088-952-616-373-78X; 094-569-126-108-938; 094-740-990-253-828; 100-887-382-061-509; 103-391-262-261-223; 103-936-727-905-832; 105-890-003-836-896; 106-489-558-395-647; 107-612-251-247-292; 118-513-543-976-791; 121-656-974-147-713; 121-953-435-666-371; 122-863-521-665-807; 125-065-731-462-111; 127-651-616-015-126; 127-756-216-463-270; 131-900-393-723-959; 132-819-828-269-838; 133-237-242-730-590; 135-629-216-501-132; 138-970-336-907-821; 143-401-886-825-354; 151-957-596-917-668; 164-975-315-048-752; 169-516-998-328-516; 175-731-387-559-111; 189-872-767-291-767; 196-948-184-120-415,12,true,,green
035-366-355-061-782,Asylum Policy and European Union Politics,2020-03-31,2020,reference entry,Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics,,Oxford University Press,,Ariadna Ripoll Servent; Natascha Zaun,"<p>Since the crisis of 2015/2016, asylum has become the focus of attention in the European Union (EU). The right to seek refuge raises issues of sovereignty and control of the territory; hence, with the gradual integration of European member states into a single area free of internal borders, there has been a functional pressure to harmonize domestic asylum policies. However, this process of integration continues to be highly contested on two main axes: the extent of harmonization (how much should the EU do in the area of asylum) and the content of the policies (should the emphasis lie on territorial security or individual rights). The tension between this “core state power” status and the EU’s international obligations has shaped both policy developments and academic debates since the emergence of asylum as an EU policy field in the mid-1990s.</p>;                <p>The integration of asylum policies is intimately linked to the emergence of Schengen as a borderless zone. Indeed, the idea that, in a Europe without borders, member states cannot control the flow of migrants led national governments to find common rules on ascribing responsibility for international protection claims. The rules agreed in the Dublin Convention of 1990 have become the core pillar that structures the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). This system aims to harmonize the definition of a refugee and the procedures and rights that need to be followed when considering asylum requests, as well as the conditions for receiving asylum seekers (e.g., housing, access to healthcare, and the job market). This process of harmonization has not been uncontested: while the first legislative phase (2001–2005) remained highly intergovernmental and was characterized by little progress being made in the approximation of domestic asylum systems, the second phase (2008–2013) showed an increased reluctance of member states to strengthen the powers of the EU in this field. As a result, the CEAS has been epitomized by faulty implementation and weak approximation—especially among those member states that did not have strong asylum systems in place before integration began. These gaps have left the CEAS in a dangerous position, since they have created incentives for those who benefit the least from EU cooperation to bypass their obligations. There, the principles underpinning the Dublin regime have been at the core of the functional crises that have recurrently emerged in the EU. The so-called “asylum crisis” has shown the weaknesses of the CEAS as well as the incapacity of member states to reform the system and find a solution that addresses the current imbalances. The main solutions have come via externalization, whereby the EU has sought to strengthen the responsibility of third countries like Turkey and Libya.</p>;                <p>These trends have also been the focus of attention in this highly interdisciplinary field. Debates have generally concentrated on either the internal or the external dimension of EU policy-making. When it comes to the internal dimension, early scholarship centered on the process of integration and the development of asylum into a new policy field. They showed how the major drivers of integration followed functional logics of spillover from the single market and Schengen—but that the nature of this policy area called for different political dynamics. This process remained highly intergovernmental until the early 2000s, which gave interior ministers the power to escape domestic constraints (e.g., civil society, national parliaments, and courts) and shape EU policies in relative isolation. This does not mean, however, that this intergovernmental process was uncontentious. Indeed, it has been shown how the core principles of EU asylum respond to a public goods logic, whereby member states try to shift their responsibility for asylum seekers away from their territory and onto that of their neighbors. Although the idea of “burden-sharing” (and hence a generalized negative perception of asylum) is shared by most member states, the processes of uploading and downloading policies between the domestic and the EU level have been more complicated than just building a “Fortress Europe.” Among those who were traditional recipients of asylum seekers and had strong asylum systems, there has been a clear game of regulatory competition that has sometimes led to a race to the bottom. In comparison, those that had no experience with international protection and lacked a strong asylum system have generally struggled to adapt to EU standards, which has reinforced the imbalances and weaknesses of the Dublin regime. Given these dynamics, most scholars expected the shift to a fully supranational decision-making process to produce far-reaching policy changes and have a rights-enhancing effect. The outcomes have not always fulfilled expectations, which underlines the importance of opening up the black box of preference formation in the EU institutions and member states. What scholars do agree on is that policy outputs on the EU level have often failed to materialize into policy outcomes on the domestic level, which has led to processes of informal adaptation and the strengthening of EU operational agencies like Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). In addition, these internal failures have pushed the EU to externalize border controls as well as push the responsibility for international protection toward third countries. There has been a clear case of policy diffusion toward neighboring countries, but also an increased dynamic of policy convergence among hosting countries like Australia and the USA. These policies tend to emphasize exclusionary practices, notably extraterritorial processing and border control—leading to major questions about the survival of asylum as an international human right in the years to come.</p>;                <p>These trends show that asylum continues to be a highly contested EU policy both in its internal and external dimensions. We need, therefore, to look more closely at the impact of polarization and politicization on EU policy-making as well as on how they might affect the role played by the EU and its member states in global debates about migration and the right to seek asylum.</p>",,,,,Political economy; Political science; Neofunctionalism; Regulatory competition; Harmonization; Liberal intergovernmentalism; European union; Politics,,,,,https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1057,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1057,,10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1057,3041772342,,0,,2,false,,

This study aims to redress this, by analysing the shifting ideational drivers of AML policy in Singapore over the past 31 years through a thematic analysis of Singapore’s parliamentary debates (Hansard). Design/methodology/approach Through a thematic analysis of Singapore's Hansard over the past 31 years, this study seeks to present a social constructivist perspective of AML policy adoption in Singapore. Findings The thematic analysis reveals how the internal driving forces of AML policy in Singapore have shifted, from the idea of “crime prevention” in the early 1990s, to the symbolic value of “international norm compliance” by the 2010s. Research limitations/implications This constructivist perspective of AML policy adoption is particularly useful in complementing the existing materialist theories of AML policy diffusion and allows us to better appreciate the historical nuances of AML policy transfer across the globe. Practical implications This research will provide a useful comparative case study for other policy mobility scholars interested in presenting a constructivist account of AML policy adoption in different jurisdictions.

Pelz,"The policy diffusion framework is critical to understanding the spread of policy innovations such as charter schools in the United States. This framework, however, is less instructive in explaining the state-by-state configuration of these policies. What explains the wide variation in charter school policy among states? This study addresses this question by introducing the concept of policy regimes. Policy regimes capture dominant and distinct approaches to policy innovations that are informed by common institutional environments among states. This article applies this concept to charter schools by studying state charter school policies and their effects on academic performance. Factor analysis of different charter school policies identifies four unique policy regimes: independence, support, accountability, and mandate. These four regimes are linked to a series of state characteristics.

It defined policy as action taken toward problem solving by government or an organization. It also defined policy change as the replacement of one or more existing policies with another. The paper adopted advocacy coalition framework as theoretical frame work and explained policy change. The theory explained that policy change occurs through interactions between wide external changes or shocks to the political system and the success of the ideas in the coalitions, which may cause actors in the advocacy coalition to shift coalitions. More so, the paper discussed six reasons to why policies change in Nigeria, these reasons are: failure of the existing policy to accomplish it set objective, political instability, ineffective and corrupt political leadership, policy diffusion, change in structure and socio-economic factors. And finally the paper recommended that for a policy to fully achieve its set goal and objective, there should be continuity of policy implementation irrespective of the person or political party in office, proper assessment and implementation of policy will also reduce the risk of policy failure and also policy makers should have the people at heart and not use the predicament of the people for personal gain.",4,2,24,,Public economics; Government; Set (psychology); Political science; Structure (mathematical logic); Action (philosophy); Political system; Political instability; Frame work; Politics,,,,,http://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/journal/paperinfo?journalid=545&paperId=10045788 https://article.sciencepublishinggroup.com/pdf/10.11648.j.jppa.20200402.12.pdf http://article.journalofppa.org/pdf/10.11648.j.jppa.20200402.12.pdf https://membership.sciencepublishinggroup.com/journal/paperinfo?journalid=545&doi=10.11648/j.jppa.20200402.12 http://www.journalofppa.org/article/545/10.11648.j.jppa.20200402.12,http://dx.doi.org/10.11648/j.jppa.20200402.12,,10.11648/j.jppa.20200402.12,3029254849,,0,030-474-124-464-230; 034-654-993-831-673; 053-403-667-530-915; 111-282-582-555-201; 112-294-182-022-937; 164-910-672-684-098,1,true,cc-by,gold
035-754-408-816-46X,From Amsterdam to Bamako: a qualitative case study on diffusion entrepreneurs' contribution to performance-based financing propagation in Mali.,2019-09-16,2019,journal article,Health policy and planning,14602237; 02681080,Oxford University Press,United Kingdom,Lara Gautier; Abdourahmane Coulibaly; Manuela De Allegri; Valéry Ridde,"For the past 15 years, several donors have promoted performance-based financing (PBF) in Africa for improving health services provision. European and African experts known as 'diffusion entrepreneurs' (DEs) assist with PBF pilot testing. In Mali, after participating in a first pilot PBF in 2012-13, the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene included PBF in its national strategic plan. It piloted this strategy again in 2016-17. We investigated the interactions between foreign experts and domestic actors towards PBF diffusion in Mali from 2009 to 2018. Drawing on the framework on DEs (Gautier et al., 2018), we examine the characteristics of DEs acting at the global, continental and (sub)national levels; and their contribution to policy framing, emulation, experimentation and learning, across locations of PBF implementation. Using an interpretive approach, this longitudinal qualitative case study analyses data from observations (N = 5), interviews (N = 33) and policy documentation (N = 19). DEs framed PBF as the logical continuation of decentralization, contracting policies and existing policies. Policy emulation started with foreign DEs inspiring domestic actors' interest, and succeeded thanks to longstanding relationships and work together. Learning was initiated by European DEs through training sessions and study tours outside Mali, and by African DEs transferring their passion and tacit knowledge to PBF implementers. However, the short-time frame and numerous implementation gaps of the PBF pilot project led to incomplete policy learning. Despite the many pitfalls of the region-wide pilot project, policy actors in Mali decided to pursue this policy in Mali.

Evidence from Preferential Trade Agreements,2019-07-12,2019,journal article,International Studies Quarterly,00208833; 14682478,Oxford University Press (OUP),United Kingdom,Todd Allee; Manfred Elsig,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Most accounts of international negotiations suggest that global agreements are individually crafted and distinct, while some emerging scholarship suggests a heavy reliance on models and templates. In this research, we present a comprehensive test of whether new international treaties are heavily copied and pasted from past ones. We specify several reasons to expect widespread copying and pasting, and argue that both the most and least powerful countries should be most likely to do so. Using text analysis to examine several hundred preferential trade agreements (PTAs), we reveal that most PTAs copy a sizable majority of their content word for word from an earlier agreement. At least one hundred PTAs take 80 percent or more of their contents directly from a single, existing treaty—with many copying and pasting 95 percent or more. These numbers climb even higher when we compare important substantive chapters of trade agreements, many of which are copied and pasted verbatim. Such copying and pasting is most prevalent among low-capacity governments that lean heavily on existing templates, and powerful states that desire to spread their preferred rules globally. This widespread replication of existing treaty language reshapes how we think about international cooperation, and it has important implications for literatures on institutional design, policy diffusion, state power, and legal fragmentation.</jats:p>",63,3,603,613,International trade; Political science; International economics,,,,,"https://www.wti.org/research/publications/998/are-the-contents-of-international-treaties-copied-and-pasted-unique-evidence-from-preferential-trade-agreements/ http://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/63/3/603/5531760 https://boris.unibe.ch/89220/ http://wp.peio.me/wp-content/uploads/PEIO8/Allee,%20Elsig%2013.2.2015.pdf https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/63/3/603/5531760",http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqz029,,10.1093/isq/sqz029,2418162952,,0,001-411-450-476-00X; 002-329-854-148-284; 003-412-189-797-295; 005-519-025-600-698; 005-931-037-520-438; 006-966-933-676-154; 007-325-528-345-171; 008-451-054-330-616; 010-315-266-005-781; 011-156-863-872-040; 013-642-099-558-035; 014-758-884-212-233; 017-024-678-733-27X; 017-928-849-887-225; 019-992-018-276-57X; 020-460-869-484-367; 022-746-059-869-309; 022-783-745-163-464; 022-984-183-846-546; 023-640-124-293-23X; 023-672-511-213-267; 024-260-245-368-949; 026-259-057-516-46X; 026-814-794-590-459; 027-121-059-541-540; 028-819-293-131-508; 029-382-790-597-242; 030-320-916-664-730; 032-146-769-646-162; 032-595-483-120-767; 034-080-442-433-775; 034-277-783-905-290; 036-707-766-001-812; 037-891-875-984-482; 038-242-482-476-045; 041-252-676-705-595; 044-499-813-856-060; 044-725-815-546-069; 046-091-405-783-716; 047-376-617-153-236; 047-653-727-554-316; 047-831-578-448-825; 050-912-419-729-26X; 051-833-583-501-751; 052-201-386-466-679; 052-664-251-354-144; 055-185-018-771-276; 056-820-777-625-655; 057-742-394-881-948; 057-780-940-027-317; 058-879-209-539-547; 060-231-479-988-713; 060-520-199-901-960; 061-582-453-992-985; 065-201-524-145-104; 065-228-999-722-630; 066-232-168-466-435; 066-882-287-972-052; 068-863-749-158-012; 069-622-072-600-823; 070-735-967-240-191; 071-420-769-003-427; 074-367-036-973-759; 075-685-236-336-965; 076-091-907-176-666; 078-508-022-431-854; 084-339-657-672-099; 084-813-008-824-625; 085-196-127-555-013; 086-795-778-840-37X; 086-882-400-728-277; 088-388-347-341-207; 091-211-921-143-171; 095-463-740-133-632; 097-334-183-499-851; 097-338-298-977-671; 097-518-892-427-021; 097-733-016-817-777; 097-816-641-380-703; 097-890-801-822-079; 098-170-250-157-412; 098-596-335-805-448; 099-315-755-138-218; 099-641-009-787-957; 101-436-352-533-580; 104-114-600-650-127; 107-076-545-096-630; 109-182-166-398-905; 110-867-129-937-890; 111-526-515-710-986; 111-730-285-859-547; 112-002-272-245-977; 112-193-837-678-273; 114-647-787-264-107; 114-987-724-332-505; 118-021-351-273-564; 119-961-421-946-282; 120-280-572-908-437; 120-428-587-951-698; 121-854-249-348-659; 122-605-738-413-684; 122-692-404-122-121; 123-602-902-091-633; 125-353-911-664-18X; 126-262-517-932-054; 126-434-698-812-083; 127-970-915-933-865; 134-518-191-628-429; 135-031-580-909-744; 139-186-190-548-754; 142-824-223-255-651; 143-909-501-748-253; 146-709-433-935-921; 148-031-976-572-844; 149-705-153-456-230; 153-458-406-530-101; 154-739-737-836-831; 158-024-786-556-461; 159-710-259-479-907; 162-550-492-986-559; 164-891-665-873-551; 174-284-561-253-882; 177-417-023-122-717; 180-045-017-546-453; 181-293-927-200-282; 196-045-346-347-288; 198-863-122-652-985,58,true,,green

While economists have widely recognized latecomer advantage, the policy diffusion literature in political science has failed to emphasize the connection between learning and competition. This article distinguishes competitive learning from learning that is not driven by competitive pressure (that is, ‘pure learning’). It models policy diffusion as a game played on social networks that govern competitive pressure and the possibilities of information transfer. The article develops an empirical test for competitive learning using spatial lags, which are applied to data on the performance of larger English local authorities from 2002 to 2006. Evidence is found for both competitive learning and pure learning. The sharper distinction between causal mechanisms proposed in this article should be widely applicable to diffusion across international boundaries and sub-national units.",1,1,3,25,Competitive learning; Empirical research; Economics; Competition (economics); Competitive pressure; Diffusion (acoustics); Industrial organization; Yardstick; Information transfer,,,,,http://repository.essex.ac.uk/7957/ https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:cup:pscirm:v:1:y:2013:i:01:p:3-25_00 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/pscirm/v1y2013i01p3-25_00.html https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/competitive-learning-in-yardstick-competition-testing-models-of-policy-diffusion-with-performance-data/77988C6A9ABE90FE73D0C62B4766706F https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2049847013000010 http://core.ac.uk/display/16703616,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2013.1,,10.1017/psrm.2013.1,2155246068,,0,000-267-571-130-101; 002-684-452-408-473; 007-748-315-099-75X; 010-278-292-671-040; 015-586-822-938-491; 016-990-943-209-704; 017-794-049-138-268; 018-115-185-934-516; 018-732-477-395-183; 019-613-487-066-521; 022-572-734-505-836; 023-297-486-496-127; 023-672-511-213-267; 027-835-981-532-333; 028-167-799-361-916; 032-220-205-010-399; 033-085-475-899-252; 033-969-989-312-301; 034-277-783-905-290; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-388-056-843-087; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 038-818-459-512-182; 051-693-635-590-388; 054-765-543-704-543; 058-071-798-060-611; 061-373-791-267-531; 063-400-296-712-427; 064-748-247-604-247; 065-666-299-776-558; 067-490-686-317-462; 074-901-672-087-085; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-507-057-908-053; 085-034-227-045-860; 087-248-023-920-180; 090-717-795-859-348; 094-833-126-001-305; 095-229-437-974-492; 104-284-421-104-309; 105-526-785-996-251; 106-849-287-769-112; 106-877-026-397-611; 115-298-402-525-905; 119-697-447-552-986; 127-181-294-020-024; 127-629-011-033-152; 127-826-672-055-220; 132-861-720-144-821; 137-674-676-505-121; 139-186-190-548-754; 157-969-366-462-465; 162-482-560-911-945; 171-281-458-059-413; 190-032-990-340-879,23,false,,

The article by Robert and colleagues highlights that although globalization has increased opportunities to share and spread ideas, there is still great asymmetry of power according to the countries’ economic and political development. It also emphasizes how policy diffusion from High Income Countries (HICs) to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) have had flaws at understanding their political, economic, and cultural backgrounds while they are pursuing knowledge translation. Achieving a fair global health policy diffusion of ideas would imply a call for a renewal on political elites worldwide at coping global health politics.

The central hypothesis is that the variable that activates the mechanisms for CCTs diffusion was the existence of a consensus on a regional scale among a group of experts and influential professionals about its effectiveness. The second hypothesis affirms that in the diffusion of these programs, the epistemic communities influenced the generation of three different mechanisms: learning, emulation and coercion. Finally, I point out that the success of each diffusion mechanism as a key element to explain the adoption of the policy will be determined by the characteristics of the national actors, their motivations and means, and the institutional capacities.",,,61,88,Positive economics; Diffusion (business); Emulation; Political science; Variable (computer science); Element (criminal law); Coercion; State (polity); Mechanism (sociology); Scale (social sciences),,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-51008-4_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51008-4_3,,10.1007/978-3-030-51008-4_3,3081248314,,0,003-544-056-320-324; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-722-686-316-360; 008-271-422-452-193; 011-581-715-697-516; 017-073-603-676-03X; 021-907-061-236-840; 032-543-293-967-145; 032-689-677-143-374; 034-277-783-905-290; 036-303-248-155-570; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-318-000-420-191; 040-148-983-786-763; 048-658-298-134-303; 051-642-317-065-406; 051-856-408-196-595; 052-723-818-069-06X; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-121-006-432-261; 068-383-000-719-006; 075-701-130-461-247; 077-331-000-789-946; 088-993-237-313-315; 093-779-978-973-429; 096-548-920-809-272; 105-526-785-996-251; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-677-347-760-402; 129-038-185-433-517; 131-045-605-566-752; 131-385-826-037-855; 133-087-716-464-773; 140-679-184-307-082; 144-071-978-395-176; 146-422-021-654-674; 156-057-484-478-603; 184-638-759-472-325; 188-000-686-619-72X,0,false,,

The UK as an established power and as a member of the European Union appears keen to play a leadership role in climate cooperation, both within the EU and at the multilateral level. However, as in other areas of international politics, emerging countries are becoming increasingly important players for dealing with climate change. In this sense, leadership on the part of the UK would require some constructive engagement of these countries. The article looks at how the UK engages emerging countries, both on its own and in coordination with its EU partners. It addresses both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy efforts. It argues that although the UK is making an effort to engage emerging countries, these efforts are still at an early stage, and they also suffer from a lack of resources and strategic direction. Some policy diffusion is observed in relation to China, but this has not translated to the convergence of positions in cli...",29,3,447,462,Emerging markets; Political economy; Political science; China; Law; Power (social and political); Convergence (economics); Constructive engagement; European union; International relations; Diplomacy,,,,,https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-uk-and-emerging-countries-in-the-climate-regime-whither-leadership(bf25d131-71f0-4e35-906e-40914f3d9af2).html https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13600826.2015.1017554,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13600826.2015.1017554,,10.1080/13600826.2015.1017554,2062823540,,0,,1,true,,green

By 2015, the value of domestic investment in five central provinces alone was 2.5 times that of foreign investment throughout China. Compared to the original “flying geese” model of tiered production in Asia, China's experience is distinct in three ways: (1) industrial transfer occurred domestically, rather than across nations; (2) sub-national transfer followed cross-national transfer; and (3) industrial migration is accompanied by a delayed replication of government policies and practices. While coastal locales today resolve to expel low-end industries, inland governments cannot afford to be selective and have only recently adopted the aggressive investment promotion tactics that coastal cities abandoned years ago. Policy diffusion is delayed as policy adoption depends on economic conditions, which vary widely across China and change over time.",234,,420,443,Public policy; China; Geography; Investment (macroeconomics); Domestic investment; Investment promotion; Change over time; Foreign direct investment; Market economy; Development economics; Capital (economics),,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/domestic-flying-geese-industrial-transfer-and-delayed-policy-diffusion-in-china/5D0A087D70F82BC1A4D3718E70448D9F,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0305741018000516,,10.1017/s0305741018000516,2749328332,,0,001-636-656-766-405; 001-742-311-594-504; 002-926-003-192-151; 007-559-451-026-51X; 009-216-468-170-364; 017-648-229-181-567; 019-827-847-545-395; 020-877-165-813-947; 025-457-208-815-418; 027-566-356-836-70X; 029-055-492-537-219; 035-663-773-175-310; 036-932-556-988-955; 042-984-557-428-820; 043-121-908-138-714; 047-578-952-204-286; 050-852-177-661-087; 051-391-516-317-211; 051-704-331-344-883; 056-943-556-626-697; 057-686-287-638-308; 061-128-017-962-376; 066-666-182-176-627; 070-093-278-913-352; 071-247-963-759-598; 071-258-784-044-347; 071-371-409-995-807; 071-469-383-842-743; 072-375-731-683-38X; 074-022-274-584-915; 077-160-184-698-761; 078-434-160-503-570; 080-144-122-481-987; 081-187-408-746-385; 081-704-083-021-177; 082-794-637-741-722; 091-286-689-702-712; 095-312-899-933-086; 099-834-885-875-720; 105-045-942-230-667; 106-574-553-240-263; 109-128-203-270-023; 117-664-360-995-027; 123-242-724-663-785; 125-189-362-294-822; 134-453-093-661-87X; 141-678-543-219-132; 145-184-831-922-055; 145-566-235-375-909; 145-793-057-747-158; 149-306-543-309-991; 154-765-514-900-831; 161-335-649-600-522; 162-124-945-392-242; 164-487-012-144-517; 165-673-184-212-075; 170-579-965-370-842; 182-268-076-870-211; 190-727-545-356-283; 191-930-486-299-679; 193-143-616-761-105; 193-713-640-246-658,41,false,,

However, prolific scholarship has highlighted the transnational diffusion of policy innovations, but the insights provided – at least for policies – are limited by a ‘democracy bias’, that is, the focus of most studies is on democracies. This limitation concerns both the empirical scope of most diffusion studies and their theoretical underpinning. Furthermore, the emphasis placed on the diffusion mechanisms has hindered the development of conceptual frameworks that systematically account for political regime characteristics and their role for policy diffusion. To take a first step towards reducing this gap, we propose an alternative conceptual framework. It builds on the existing literature on policy diffusion, but shifts the perspective from the international to the national context. In the subsequent discussion we put forward a theoretical framework that explicitly accounts for the role of political regime types in policy diffusion and shifts the analytical focus from mechanisms to ‘routes’ of diffusion.",7,4,534,540,Public economics; Positive economics; Diffusion (business); Conceptual framework; Economics; Scholarship; Context (language use); Scope (project management); Sociological theory of diffusion; Democracy; Politics,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1758-5899.12363 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/glopol/v7y2016i4p534-540.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12363,,10.1111/1758-5899.12363,2549840486,,0,000-493-869-570-981; 001-201-766-840-730; 003-688-909-440-09X; 005-249-461-623-469; 007-413-555-491-051; 011-069-448-772-469; 011-809-902-368-337; 025-645-920-630-271; 028-933-497-480-442; 031-788-994-166-227; 035-353-864-519-103; 036-917-406-227-119; 049-036-971-753-623; 050-082-471-457-812; 053-001-226-328-904; 055-402-799-153-144; 063-643-701-913-238; 072-457-024-073-91X; 073-796-412-498-509; 077-945-151-328-246; 079-659-395-260-212; 081-774-921-119-717; 086-220-243-754-603; 097-619-405-643-951; 099-162-906-495-841; 101-507-678-437-367; 109-631-267-819-044; 118-513-543-976-791; 123-893-910-829-020; 128-371-572-183-477; 130-207-548-437-526; 139-364-479-001-898; 141-935-429-721-000; 144-173-014-415-483; 162-415-263-848-564; 172-995-832-431-889; 177-844-062-752-494; 184-916-312-841-806; 196-645-462-460-623,10,false,,

This article explores how the main territorial dynamics of the State of Autonomies have affected three key areas of public action on gender equality, namely gender mainstreaming, electoral quotas and policies against gender violence. The results of the empirical analysis align with the so-called “conditional approach” recently adopted by the literature that avoids oversimplifying the multilevel structure as either positive or negative for equality policies and identifies instead the specific characteristics of the institutional configuration that promote or limit them. In the Spanish case, inter-regional competitive dynamics have stimulated policy diffusion through learning processes and women’s agency has often taken advantage of the multilevel opportunity structure. Nonetheless, a high degree of decentralization coupled with weak intergovernmental cooperation mechanisms has led to fragmentation and diversity in policy making in some areas.",,39,239,261,Agency (sociology); Decentralization; Political science; Power (social and political); State (polity); Gender mainstreaming; Diversity (politics); Public administration; Distribution (economics); Federalism; Welfare economics,,,,,http://recyt.fecyt.es/index.php/recp/article/view/38498/pdf_10,http://recyt.fecyt.es/index.php/recp/article/view/38498/pdf_10,,,2196891303,,0,,2,false,,

This study reviews state-level complete streets policies. Our research questions are: (1) In what ways do the states with a complete streets policy differ from the states without one? (2) Have complete streets policies become more comprehensive over time? (3) Does the type of policy—a law passed by a state legislature versus an executive-level policy—change the comprehensiveness of the policy? We find that urbanized states are more likely to have complete streets policies. Diffusion of the policy appears weakly associated with adjacency of adopting states.

S. Butler; John Poe; Whitney Davis,"The American states are engaged in a variety of policy efforts to mitigate climate change and alter energy usage. While a number of studies have considered the reasons for adoption of renewable energy and climate change policies, they typically consider only one policy in isolation. This study examines policy adoption of 14 energy and climate change programs in a pooled event history analysis. Our primary research questions consider average effects of horizontal policy diffusion, while also identifying factors that vary across policy type. We offer a method of testing whether predictors vary across policies and use this test to incorporate interactions by policy in the statistical analysis. Our results indicate that many of the primary drivers of adoption are political in nature, including state ideology, environmental interest group membership, and diffusion via ideologically similar neighbors. In addition, we find that given policy heterogeneity, a number of determinants vary by policy type, though differences are in magnitude rather than direction.",33,5,544,565,Public economics; Climate change; Variety (cybernetics); Ideology; Economics; Political economy of climate change; Primary research; Corporate governance; Economic system; Energy (esotericism); Politics,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ropr.12189 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/revpol/v33y2016i5p544-565.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ropr.12189,,10.1111/ropr.12189,2518150796,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 001-481-906-279-295; 003-592-471-884-916; 005-612-054-999-243; 005-692-270-875-15X; 011-805-791-178-275; 014-462-810-343-342; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-456-406-334-322; 025-606-721-467-617; 032-710-399-881-476; 036-533-341-050-806; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 045-669-420-834-130; 047-385-352-717-976; 064-358-299-773-743; 064-463-299-403-755; 067-380-084-378-236; 067-490-686-317-462; 071-550-480-833-847; 075-865-534-773-264; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-475-330-427-103; 079-705-757-170-703; 089-791-829-076-043; 102-490-342-063-275; 109-723-950-284-919; 117-005-511-150-947; 128-412-145-076-659; 132-273-809-002-183; 137-502-161-626-919; 155-580-858-393-517,46,true,,green

The phenomena to be compared, instead of consisting of independent analytical units, are likely to influence each other. This contribution reviews existing approaches to examine interdependent decision making, with special attention for the differences between subnational and international public policies. The empirical literature on policy diffusion will be investigated through a meta-analysis of the “necessary conditions” for different diffusion mechanisms. To this end, a sample of empirical studies is examined with fuzzy-set analysis, and illustrated with some examples.",19,2,99,120,Public policy; Empirical research; Diffusion (business); Econometrics; Economics; Interdependence; Literature study; Sample (statistics); Comparative method; Meta-analysis,,,,,https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_RIPC_192_0099--the-problem-of-interdependence-in.htm,https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_RIPC_192_0099--the-problem-of-interdependence-in.htm,,,2973051497,,0,,0,false,,

In this chapter, we develop an approach to transnational mobilization built on ideational factors (e.g. cultural contexts, identities, norms, symbols and language) to explain variations of TNA success in policy diffusion. The contribution our ideational approach makes to transnational policy diffusion is threefold. First, using the illustration of disability and gender policies, our framework strives for determining the circumstances under which TNAs succeed and/or fail with diffusing transnational norms in an ideationally charged socio-political environment. Second, the framework abstracts the implications of underlying power factors in policy diffusion. Third, our framework bridges public policy concepts to devise an explanatory framework for social policy diffusion that could be applied to many policy situations.",,,305,332,Public policy; Diffusion (business); Political economy; Political science; Social policy; Power (social and political); State (polity); Politics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-38200-1_12 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-38200-1_12.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38200-1_12,,10.1007/978-3-030-38200-1_12,3039088079,,0,003-898-062-372-559; 005-497-091-871-811; 006-848-696-286-242; 013-942-068-751-873; 018-483-695-260-055; 020-041-971-346-79X; 020-957-992-864-772; 027-524-566-883-859; 030-751-623-978-394; 031-321-650-922-341; 035-762-699-112-154; 036-354-171-090-712; 040-446-940-062-541; 042-166-832-672-947; 043-341-106-242-389; 044-620-020-424-665; 045-083-389-613-437; 048-810-159-113-901; 052-230-698-024-389; 052-723-818-069-06X; 062-284-958-519-406; 068-873-109-492-468; 076-820-815-396-749; 087-551-225-721-384; 098-929-261-686-185; 101-950-902-333-64X; 106-534-415-256-615; 110-437-501-545-544; 117-295-565-102-383; 131-057-877-810-606; 132-995-616-971-951; 135-054-751-914-815; 137-149-220-755-098; 140-326-797-432-202; 143-439-032-444-017; 148-460-439-813-652; 152-469-318-417-464; 158-993-597-296-739; 162-641-557-472-780; 165-596-578-665-003; 168-510-291-284-51X; 171-458-998-894-584; 178-064-823-658-419; 178-762-715-606-441; 179-852-785-824-255; 190-579-299-251-15X; 192-658-209-715-968,1,true,cc-by,gold

The latest wave of regionalism took shape of mega-regionals (mega-FTAs) – deep and expansive trade alliances between countries or regions with a dominant share of world economy, trade and population. Key mega-FTAs include the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the EU-initiated Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The fact that these three unprecedented mega-FTAs, championed by competition trading powers, burst upon the global scene within a rather circumscribed period of time (early 2010 to mid-2013) is intellectually puzzling.; ; This dissertation explains why and how the three mega-FTAs suddenly came into being using a competitive policy diffusion framework. Unlike existing regionalism scholarship which tends to ‘vertically’ analyse FTAs as separate entities arising out of autonomous government decisions to entertain domestic concerns, this study undertakes a ‘horizontal’ diffusion-oriented research agenda to investigate the causally linked calculus of major power participation in the on-going mega-regionalism at the international strategic level. It conceptualises mega-FTA as a geo-economic strategy for the US, China and the EU to compete against each other, economically, politically and legally. It is argued that the TPP allowed the US to reap economic benefits from freer trade, demonstrate regional leadership and disseminate a favourable trade temple at the direct expenses of China. The disadvantaged China was then pressurised to respond in kind by launching a countervailing mega-trade pact of its own, i.e. RCEP, to level the playing field. The US’ TPP and China’s subsequent resorting to RCEP as its defence mechanism generated cumulative negative externalities along economic, political and legal dimensions for the EU, forcing the bloc to abandon its long-standing multilateralism-centred trade policy paradigm to enter into TTIP negotiations. The move by the US, the counter-move by China and the counter-countermove by the EU eventually gave rise to the wave of mega-regionalism as we have observed in recent times.; ; A mixed method research design involving quantitative, qualitative and perceptual perspectives is adopted by this dissertation. Great power competition in the economic realm is captured by two formal approaches to international political economy. The computational general equilibrium simulations using the modified Global Trade Analysis Project model suggest that the logic of economic competition is premised on the international distributional effects of mega-FTA in terms of creating trade among participating economies while diverting trade away from non-members. The modelling results inform a follow-up game theoretical analysis to help visualise the way in which the economic competition unfolded in payoff matrices. Case study and content analysis methods are engaged to put up my arguments about political/legal competition and sketch out the broader historic backgrounds against which the genesises of mega-FTAs must be viewed. In a final step, a perception survey soliciting representative thinking of Asian experts was conducted to strengthen the main findings of the dissertation. The triangulation of data and arguments provide stronger evidence to the present dissertation’s conclusion that the trilateral geo-economic power play on the part of the US, China and the EU is the key cause and driver of the latest wave of mega-regionalism.Doctor of Philosoph",,,,,International trade; Political science; China; Mega-; European union; Economic power; Regionalism (international relations),,,,,https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/82993/3/Thesis_Xianbai%20Ji%20REVISED.pdf https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10220/47576,http://dx.doi.org/10.32657/10220/47576,,10.32657/10220/47576,2912957386,,0,,2,true,,green

Reddick,"Despite previous studies on comparing open data policies and identifying their challenges, little is known about open data policy innovation diffusion in Australia, one of earlier adopters of open government/open data policies and a leading e-government nation worldwide. Drawing on innovation diffusion theory and its application to public policy innovation research in political science, we examine Australia's open data policy diffusion patterns at federal and state government levels. Australian early adopters of open data policies are positively associated with the level of openness of their open data portals. Portal openness is measured by the number of public datasets proactively and systematically published through their data portals. They are also positively associated with the efficacy of policy entrepreneurs, which are lead departments/agencies responsible for pushing open data policies against the existing barriers in the governments. Their efficacy is measured by the relatively high rank in the measure of open data portal openness.",,,155,163,Public economics; Public policy; Early adopter; Economics; State (polity); Open government; Open data; State government; Innovation diffusion; Openness to experience,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/2912160.2912173 https://ro.uow.edu.au/eispapers/5653/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2912160.2912173,,10.1145/2912160.2912173,2479828740,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 009-604-238-587-994; 010-194-557-649-343; 011-635-910-355-096; 032-164-929-841-901; 034-702-428-350-539; 037-213-022-702-823; 043-825-295-221-106; 054-082-666-090-091; 059-583-377-374-87X; 066-605-269-839-199; 066-773-345-376-927; 072-127-065-215-716; 074-075-868-737-973; 076-641-631-123-216; 077-292-312-519-129; 078-455-009-415-706; 079-705-757-170-703; 081-666-206-964-649; 084-787-681-556-687; 098-317-151-036-205; 099-158-767-206-576; 102-169-007-053-650; 143-875-130-007-110; 150-352-717-133-010; 173-821-701-318-460; 190-652-676-687-724,6,false,,

The period of New Labour was closing in the UK, and in Australia the Rudd government came to power after 11 years in opposition, directly influenced by the, at times, trailblazing UK Labour government. In the domain of social policy, New Labour was a source of policy inspiration and transfer. Specifically, the Rudd/Gillard governments borrowed heavily its ‘social exclusion’ agenda, and also the use of ‘compacts’ with the third sector. This article examines the policy diffusion and transfer between the UK and Australia, and in doing so offers critical insights into the policy transfer literature. The article examines the reasons for the Australian Labor Party's adoption of these policies, and links this to wider dilemmas and identity crisis that are afflicting centre-left governments across the globe.",37,5,426,439,Social exclusion; World War II; Economics; Social policy; Globe; Policy transfer; Opposition (politics); Identity crisis; Public administration,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01442872.2016.1161182 https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01442872.2016.1161182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2016.1161182,,10.1080/01442872.2016.1161182,2470183864,,0,002-406-972-629-018; 003-610-597-530-247; 007-758-759-157-059; 012-520-109-074-623; 012-562-267-270-940; 015-772-187-215-946; 017-549-788-859-078; 018-915-784-169-786; 021-439-046-681-095; 024-998-365-486-73X; 026-751-932-073-172; 027-457-715-187-869; 030-131-108-920-035; 030-412-132-629-193; 032-235-898-751-342; 032-418-331-388-206; 032-555-386-505-36X; 035-675-136-624-96X; 041-565-677-981-505; 042-172-797-959-686; 042-930-163-840-755; 054-728-159-307-92X; 055-498-815-134-39X; 056-546-348-973-855; 064-884-435-474-722; 067-903-602-169-291; 072-473-603-379-366; 075-847-216-189-282; 081-777-447-719-822; 086-019-334-763-340; 086-424-571-045-018; 086-841-108-456-306; 089-814-506-698-154; 094-371-302-418-81X; 096-460-094-775-050; 099-520-522-446-415; 100-980-494-925-822; 101-874-720-986-234; 102-918-789-947-725; 106-198-504-599-37X; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-393-269-886-987; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-470-893-309-027; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-663-029-319-098; 127-220-108-018-000; 128-275-247-873-271; 129-124-515-665-419; 137-510-651-593-654; 145-203-151-910-502; 148-460-439-813-652; 151-957-596-917-668; 158-780-131-262-730; 165-882-315-576-735; 166-699-400-581-644; 169-519-672-808-978; 173-321-697-226-369; 175-203-557-968-251; 184-800-348-844-377; 195-269-139-186-377,3,false,,
039-643-265-774-082,European Countries and the EU,,2012,book chapter,Global Tobacco Control,,Palgrave Macmillan UK,,Paul Cairney; Donley T. Studlar; Hadii M. Mamudu,"This chapter outlines the main policy developments within the European Union (EU), individual member states, and other European countries. In the past half century both the EU and several member states (and their substate governments) have taken action on tobacco policy. The EU has had a formal role in tobacco control since 1987 when it assumed shared responsibility for public health policy with its member countries. The EU’s public health authority has expanded since then to cover most of Europe as it has grown from 12 member states in 1987 to 27 in 2011. More generally, European tobacco policy has changed markedly in the post-war era. We identify a broad trend towards more restrictive tobacco control, with the number, range, and strength of tobacco policy instruments increasing markedly in the last 25 years. However, the effect is by no means uniform. There is considerable variation in the timing and substance of tobacco control within the EU and, in some cases, within member states. In particular, until recently, tobacco control has been generally less well developed in the 12 recent ‘accession’ states (mostly from Central and Eastern Europe). As a result, the effect of the EU as a source of policy diffusion has varied. Its role is relatively limited with ‘leader’ states that have demonstrated a willingness to go beyond the EU agenda. In contrast, its role is significant for ‘laggard’ states that are obliged to implement EU regulations beyond their current requirements, as well as accession states mandated to engage in tobacco control as a condition of EU membership.",,,72,98,Public health; International trade; Political science; Member state; Accession; Tobacco control; Tobacco industry; Tobacco policy; European union; Public health policy,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230361249_4 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230361249_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230361249_4,,10.1057/9780230361249_4,2487824779,,0,,1,false,,

Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is the most widely deployed approach to generate demand for, and use of sanitation facilities. CLTS relies on behavioral change and community self-enforcement to end open defecation. Since its genesis in Bangladesh in 1999, CLTS has spread to approximately 60 countries, mostly in Asia and Africa, and is employed by the majority of development organizations operating in rural sanitation. This paper uses a qualitative approach to analyze the reasons and processes that drove the wide diffusion of CLTS. We show that CLTS was embraced because it was perceived as a fast and effective solution to the problem of open defecation, one which was in line with the decentralization and community participation paradigms, at a time when donors and governments were looking for strategies to meet the MDG for sanitation. CLTS spread under the leadership of influential donors, NGOs, persuasive practitioners, and academics. Face-to-face interactions among members of this network and local governments at conferences and workshops played a central role in the diffusion of the approach. The use of experiential learning during study tours and workshop field visits has been crucial to persuade government actors at different levels, NGOs, and donors to use the CLTS approach. Notably, robust scientific evidence played little role in the diffusion of CLTS. We conclude by making suggestions to strengthen the evidence base for rural sanitation policies.",124,,104643,,Rural area; Decentralization; Business; Government; Local government; Sanitation; Community-led total sanitation; Economic growth; Social engagement; Open defecation,,,,United States Agency for International Development,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X19302918 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X19302918 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v124y2019ic6.html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193476267?q=(similar%3a19921801050),http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104643,,10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104643,2969698995,,0,000-170-119-620-306; 001-177-583-768-230; 002-110-679-526-21X; 002-216-069-818-27X; 002-222-649-252-832; 002-571-843-022-446; 002-875-412-448-94X; 004-369-541-128-767; 007-484-797-845-236; 008-914-217-222-934; 012-286-853-432-764; 012-467-150-825-142; 016-741-840-255-938; 018-046-064-811-919; 018-350-346-131-870; 018-408-967-264-552; 019-692-017-319-393; 019-781-936-292-392; 020-930-839-153-798; 022-370-084-877-877; 022-912-717-805-333; 023-077-250-775-643; 023-258-395-663-944; 024-881-432-631-10X; 025-418-788-359-882; 026-520-844-197-580; 029-687-045-558-590; 031-342-100-823-376; 032-501-788-283-794; 036-637-444-989-054; 037-095-006-212-950; 039-318-000-420-191; 039-634-984-624-641; 040-246-597-457-784; 042-584-043-141-301; 043-607-431-009-80X; 044-003-446-653-138; 047-053-350-506-744; 048-048-596-162-988; 049-167-855-009-370; 050-276-978-196-290; 052-916-895-646-490; 054-074-911-688-557; 058-594-735-457-008; 058-889-338-530-222; 061-423-346-126-362; 064-125-983-467-024; 065-710-476-819-244; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-248-198-478-915; 067-927-631-908-889; 070-563-298-463-970; 070-588-196-475-795; 071-008-793-417-73X; 074-302-457-749-424; 074-484-741-016-711; 075-016-842-241-917; 079-157-531-268-658; 084-976-765-791-732; 085-561-205-535-345; 088-079-316-047-954; 090-238-296-069-810; 090-572-152-184-856; 091-499-331-561-256; 091-753-620-827-031; 098-491-319-845-430; 101-991-433-296-92X; 104-053-432-360-262; 105-336-775-615-067; 107-543-316-416-434; 108-341-805-573-239; 108-342-999-481-985; 108-939-047-649-877; 110-548-282-228-750; 111-105-977-673-184; 111-446-472-303-538; 112-650-841-764-714; 125-490-474-878-593; 125-980-041-012-841; 129-245-112-463-290; 145-049-694-760-552; 152-930-469-174-319; 171-489-189-894-359; 175-493-688-794-720; 181-322-149-239-34X; 181-661-002-424-176; 183-246-970-375-644; 191-755-737-717-885,24,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

McGrath,"Initiated by a 1996 Georgia statute, “radical” civil service reform quickly swept the United States. This article explains the wax and eventual wane of state efforts to increase the number of at-will employees at the expense of the population of fully protected merit system employees. Using an event history approach to explain this policy diffusion with state-level variables, the author shows that electoral competition and gubernatorial powers are the most significant determinants of this kind of policy diffusion. Whereas previous literature concluded that these reforms ceased spreading because the new programs were failing to create the promised governmental efficiency, this article argues that the institutional conditions for these human resource management policies have been less propitious in recent years. The article signifies an important contribution in that it brings civil service reform back into the scope of policy diffusion literature and identifies political insights into a perpetually important question.",73,4,638,649,Political economy; Economics; Statute; Human resource management; State (polity); Competition (economics); Scope (project management); Population; Civil service; Public administration; Politics,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12075/abstract http://mcgrath.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rjm_SPPC2013.pdf https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/puar.12075,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/puar.12075,,10.1111/puar.12075,2034307477,,0,001-584-754-568-929; 001-762-503-484-957; 002-702-735-387-98X; 008-260-507-659-667; 008-845-527-252-315; 010-405-856-889-854; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-375-764-879-58X; 019-647-494-077-611; 020-328-674-440-323; 025-248-584-269-464; 031-497-939-322-733; 032-058-085-018-464; 032-668-648-129-992; 035-610-131-534-538; 035-830-082-559-935; 036-533-341-050-806; 043-783-616-716-28X; 044-958-408-877-837; 057-090-537-484-157; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-134-594-876-112; 059-274-660-526-403; 059-305-801-521-868; 061-793-046-506-062; 064-122-783-411-743; 064-685-078-882-848; 065-276-770-776-661; 070-339-434-763-497; 076-240-693-922-091; 080-883-627-988-010; 081-394-527-119-95X; 083-099-894-950-017; 086-467-712-065-072; 086-531-972-318-826; 101-488-954-100-242; 101-808-505-338-263; 102-490-342-063-275; 104-426-737-994-302; 109-038-213-914-049; 111-037-754-354-686; 117-492-933-285-367; 118-602-989-974-146; 124-307-277-038-558; 129-609-543-965-967; 131-900-393-723-959; 143-817-676-829-591; 146-334-014-079-958; 154-314-204-508-516; 160-114-813-904-566; 160-164-642-176-693; 162-310-477-554-771; 163-076-040-775-567; 165-562-323-430-928; 165-893-839-049-219; 166-620-700-637-924; 166-806-529-080-382; 169-567-513-735-640; 169-681-505-035-838; 174-138-943-975-287; 174-768-369-809-642; 179-363-689-895-275; 187-397-656-450-670; 191-557-763-387-659; 192-660-058-140-214; 196-387-513-197-185,16,false,,

Fay; Jeffrey B. Wenger,"Unlike the U.S. Constitution, many state constitutions include provisions for regulating and legislating specific policy issues. Embedding policy proscriptions in state constitutions may impact the rate and likelihood of policy diffusion. To examine how the amendment process influences diffusion resulting from geographic competition, we estimate a well-known policy diffusion model, using state-sponsored lotteries as a case study. Our mixed model of survival analysis separately estimates amendments and lottery adoptions allowing for different covariates and baseline hazards in each model. We find that there are different diffusion effects for constitutional amendments and policy adoptions, that the two-step process requires a more professionalized legislature, and that amending the state constitution influences the timing of the adoption process. Once we take into consideration the two-step process of lottery diffusion, we find a conditional diffusion effect that is over twice as large as previous estimates, and an overall diffusion that is larger than estimates from event-history estimation, suggesting that the constitutional hurdle is an important determinant of policy adoption. These effects occur over the entire policy adoption phase (1961–2009), over multiple specifications of the baseline hazard, for alternate measures of diffusion, and for alternate model specifications, thereby suggesting that the constitutional hurdle is an important element of state policy, and it should be empirically considered in future models of policy diffusion.",44,3,349,365,Public economics; Baseline (configuration management); Diffusion (business); Econometrics; Economics; Constitution; Lottery; Political structure; Competition (economics); Legislature; Estimation,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psj.12122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/psj.12122,,10.1111/psj.12122,2127961404,,0,001-481-906-279-295; 002-557-636-257-591; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-589-211-847-331; 023-236-082-357-690; 023-672-511-213-267; 023-813-661-592-756; 027-835-981-532-333; 029-515-235-558-072; 029-706-511-286-280; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-151-150-952-794; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 038-408-979-223-999; 041-211-048-747-558; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-950-951-032-538; 058-071-798-060-611; 067-490-686-317-462; 073-166-408-788-371; 076-240-693-922-091; 080-449-614-237-232; 083-128-427-871-272; 083-522-906-050-469; 084-787-681-556-687; 088-919-425-365-248; 098-317-151-036-205; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-488-954-100-242; 134-300-624-191-268; 139-880-673-101-99X; 155-580-858-393-517; 174-768-369-809-642,21,false,,

Apart from our concern to critically review this literature, our aim is also to focus in on one of its greatest deficiencies: the absence, hitherto, of a comprehensive, multi-level framework for analysis, capable of specifying the conditions under which OMC practices are likely to produce a convergence of member state policies on common objectives. In doing so we also bring into our account a parallel literature – on policy diffusion and learning – that is frequently referred to by studies of the OMC and other new modes of governance but is rarely integrated systematically into their analysis.",,,,,Public economics; Political science; European integration; Convergence (economics); Member state; Open method of coordination; Deliberative democracy; European union; Corporate governance; Normative,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/erp/eurogo/p0011.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/erp/eurogo/p0011.html,,,3152142219,,0,,3,false,,

Luke Shaefer,"Social scientists and historians have identified the exclusion of agricultural workers and domestic servants from social insurance programs during the New Deal as a cause of the racially divided US welfare state. The most prominent explanation for these exclusions is that they originated in a Southern-dominated congress and were deliberately designed to exclude a majority of African-American workers from the emerging welfare state. This article examines recent historical scholarship, archival evidence, and information on unemployment compensation programs internationally to situate this policy choice in a wider context. The exclusion of these categories of workers is consistent with the experience of other unemployment insurance programs. Given the close linkages between the technical experts who drafted the US legislation and their counterparts abroad, the exclusion of agricultural workers and domestic servants from unemployment insurance is best understood as an example of policy diffusion.",40,3,385,404,Welfare state; Labour economics; Economics; New Deal; Legislation; Scholarship; Unemployment; Social insurance; Compensation (psychology); Context (language use); Economic growth,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/article/left-out-policy-diffusion-and-the-exclusion-of-black-workers-from-unemployment-insurance/BB47A78FB42748203E43CBDF1AABE8F2 https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/BB47A78FB42748203E43CBDF1AABE8F2/S0145553216000110a.pdf/div-class-title-left-out-span-class-italic-policy-diffusion-and-the-exclusion-of-black-workers-from-unemployment-insurance-span-div.pdf https://muse.jhu.edu/article/627828/summary,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ssh.2016.11,,10.1017/ssh.2016.11,2478143567,,0,000-803-694-602-443; 002-755-832-418-206; 010-118-914-495-318; 010-246-020-908-538; 012-139-825-907-849; 022-512-643-506-628; 027-463-820-450-228; 027-827-119-143-849; 030-810-425-267-951; 032-061-515-524-533; 036-929-069-207-261; 036-971-731-053-658; 040-984-026-537-427; 046-240-083-620-274; 049-065-949-330-408; 049-089-760-674-262; 050-274-654-059-514; 053-804-182-743-872; 055-471-322-360-719; 057-711-951-522-12X; 066-597-034-427-432; 066-937-323-363-103; 077-945-151-328-246; 078-089-882-555-239; 083-128-427-871-272; 087-956-932-525-273; 088-400-507-040-665; 093-460-179-515-355; 095-421-061-786-644; 097-760-110-271-962; 111-586-583-904-496; 112-031-416-121-862; 113-442-615-353-634; 114-297-985-479-03X; 115-482-499-323-938; 119-275-698-785-098; 123-096-766-751-094; 128-150-266-973-359; 135-802-229-216-935; 138-623-719-807-469; 150-129-738-213-077; 151-957-596-917-668; 166-000-344-221-094; 167-123-013-729-017; 171-910-532-801-049; 175-224-020-022-549; 178-002-143-360-826; 181-772-957-910-013; 183-182-118-461-061,26,true,,bronze

Radaelli,"The paper examines public policy in the European Union (EU) by drawing upon the conceptual framework of policy transfer, which has been recently refined by comparativists, and the concept of isomorphism developed within organizational theory. Three case studies of EU policy transfer - namely monetary policy, tax policy, and media ownership policy - are discussed for assessing the potential of isomorphism for the analysis of policy diffusion. The author argues that European institutions, which have a serious political limitation in terms of legitimacy, stimulate policy transfer by catalysing isomorphic processes. Typically, isomorphism diffuses throughout the EU policy solutions already in place in one member state. By contrast, policy transfer is severely constrained when there are no national cases to be imitated. In this circumstance, however, European institutions, most notably the European Commission, can overcome the problem by ""inseminating"" solutions into national political systems.",,2,203,230,Public policy; Policy analysis; Political economy; Political science; Foreign policy analysis; European integration; Policy studies; Policy transfer; Tax policy; European union; Economic system,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/mul/jl9ury/doi10.1425-411y1998i2p203-230.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:mul:jl9ury:doi:10.1425/411:y:1998:i:2:p:203-230 https://www.rivisteweb.it/doi/10.1425/411,https://ideas.repec.org/a/mul/jl9ury/doi10.1425-411y1998i2p203-230.html,,,2079082366,,0,,2,false,,

The introduction concludes with a brief overview of the chapters.</jats:p>",,,1,37,Diffusion (business); Economics; Social policy; Economic geography; Geographic proximity; Colonialism,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-83403-6_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83403-6_1,,10.1007/978-3-030-83403-6_1,3217445840,,0,001-367-136-082-787; 002-765-039-198-219; 004-763-822-455-858; 006-907-529-618-649; 008-516-936-380-556; 010-278-292-671-040; 020-500-124-471-899; 021-297-009-680-471; 023-596-016-492-826; 023-886-227-961-413; 024-004-469-792-295; 026-063-146-475-781; 031-143-909-227-42X; 033-575-197-387-75X; 036-558-372-387-154; 040-385-338-024-554; 045-930-492-956-07X; 051-143-693-486-865; 051-563-283-713-00X; 054-830-325-994-667; 058-592-014-185-306; 063-131-979-046-061; 065-091-357-081-777; 067-247-740-116-320; 071-846-033-952-37X; 072-360-768-485-334; 072-676-780-521-626; 072-972-659-708-911; 073-014-201-416-869; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 082-017-566-839-450; 085-382-568-774-341; 086-139-872-882-01X; 086-310-520-682-492; 095-959-237-503-324; 103-709-081-003-003; 103-777-793-768-13X; 114-297-985-479-03X; 132-449-475-306-385; 136-148-574-067-160; 137-200-053-144-767; 138-897-177-411-117; 139-778-465-974-496; 144-068-963-489-172; 145-823-438-739-500; 151-104-141-215-040; 152-048-393-109-159; 155-170-846-503-342; 160-971-569-276-903; 176-939-375-343-064; 180-897-119-706-569; 188-488-925-993-973; 198-262-895-567-834,3,true,cc-by,gold

In addition, it will explore significant channels for the international movement of ideas, policies, and practices through an international policy learning process formed in policy transfer, lesson drawing, policy diffusion, and policy convergence. Further, it is argued that policy transfer literature is increasingly central, leading to the development of related topics in comparative politics and public policy. This article investigates the involvement of non-government organizations, civil society and political issues in driving the learning process about what government should do and can be learned with common problems.

In the wake of recent work on the creative class, culture-led development policies have been applied in cities and regions across the Western world. This article uses quantitative data to examine whether these policies have gained the support of Scandinavian local and regional politicians and, if so, why and how. Drawing on policy diffusion and policy transfer theory, the article examines from where politicians are influenced. Can the sources of influence be characterized as (1) horizontal, (2) top-down or (3) bottom-up? The main finding is that the top-down perspective identifies significant national pressure on local and regional policy-makers, leading to the conclusion that regional and local policy-making in this policy area depends on national policies.",22,5,553,575,Economics; Work (electrical); Policy studies; Economic geography; Regional policy; Policy transfer; Western world; Cultural policy; Creative class; Economic growth; Entertainment,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13597566.2012.733942 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/13597566.2012.733942,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13597566.2012.733942,,10.1080/13597566.2012.733942,1975421089,,0,000-318-988-607-216; 000-531-537-100-160; 005-102-915-358-14X; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-722-686-316-360; 008-529-043-378-945; 008-999-682-083-357; 014-249-096-546-392; 015-555-156-766-47X; 018-885-216-353-986; 021-216-291-636-927; 025-112-618-417-304; 026-309-802-591-48X; 028-946-311-393-344; 030-716-612-544-343; 032-164-929-841-901; 035-261-961-935-32X; 037-242-950-246-181; 049-219-615-824-319; 052-723-818-069-06X; 054-298-142-492-674; 054-807-253-883-419; 065-676-208-589-36X; 069-681-702-263-316; 070-491-706-755-13X; 072-490-508-939-796; 073-484-188-860-557; 075-428-805-584-444; 076-282-850-196-616; 077-235-952-619-805; 077-926-704-396-107; 084-787-681-556-687; 088-993-237-313-315; 091-729-566-642-692; 092-664-133-444-115; 094-833-126-001-305; 095-390-712-005-022; 111-175-388-455-609; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 129-143-350-106-785; 129-349-979-139-342; 134-792-734-366-042; 138-988-668-339-897; 148-460-439-813-652; 152-077-449-437-817; 171-785-423-189-444; 176-265-559-389-368; 176-481-932-611-905,1,false,,

Such work has been limited by: (1) focusing mainly on neighbor-to-neighbor diffusion paths, rather than other similarities across states; (2) neglecting the role of the success or failures of policies in their diffusion; (3) studying singular specific policy adoptions rather than the choice among policy variants; and (4) setting aside questions about how diffusion mechanisms vary across different policies and different political processes. This paper proposes the alternative approach of dyad -year event history analysis, commonly used in international relations, and applies it to the study of policy diffusion in Children’s Health Insurance Program from 19982001. This approach uncovers strong evidence of the emulation of states with similar political, demographic, and budgetary characteristics, and those with successful policies. Moreover, the diffusion mechanisms differ substantially across different policy types and political processes.",,,,,Public economics; Policy analysis; Work (electrical); Political science; Policy studies; Dyad; Children's Health Insurance Program; Event history; International relations; Politics,,,,,http://polmeth.wustl.edu/files/polmeth/volde03.pdf,http://polmeth.wustl.edu/files/polmeth/volde03.pdf,,,70953436,,0,001-099-114-464-823; 002-392-744-703-664; 002-603-673-638-187; 003-825-600-967-940; 006-282-272-395-98X; 008-178-253-128-264; 008-359-079-785-535; 012-309-073-407-444; 014-694-012-786-985; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-769-346-177-716; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-180-195-011-961; 022-175-118-235-167; 024-028-772-598-272; 026-837-791-253-328; 031-140-472-779-18X; 036-961-749-635-681; 073-753-993-648-180; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 084-787-681-556-687; 085-835-075-480-379; 086-786-776-616-409; 095-179-619-530-275; 096-517-829-236-651; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 127-807-528-981-832; 131-900-393-723-959; 136-265-890-879-315; 148-359-400-761-924; 163-637-734-144-951; 176-306-096-567-989,3,false,,

Suárez,"Because of popular and political pressure, governments have been compelled to regulate ‘excessive’ executive compensation and search both a policy and political solution. In this paper, I seek to establish the mechanisms of policy learning, competition, and emulation by examining American and British regulatory policies of executive compensation that show evidence of reciprocal diffusion, i.e. from the US to the UK and vice versa. The evidence suggests that during the past two decades, the extent of reciprocal policy diffusion varied and was primarily driven by policy learning. Using published government reports, press releases, public hearings, newspaper articles, and interviews, I demonstrate that reciprocal learning occurred because one country's policymakers and practitioners explicitly discussed and/or referred to the practices in the other country when deciding to adopt a specific policy solution to the problem of excessive executive pay. I discuss the implications for the literature on diffusion and point out avenues for future research.

041-671-539-690-290,A political study trip to the Netherlands to stimulate diffusion of Dutch bicycle policies in Sweden,2011-06-10,2011,,,,,,Nina Strategier,"Purpose: This thesis investigates if Swedish municipalities are interested to participate in a political study trip to the Netherlands with the goal to educate Swedish municipalities on Dutch bicycle policies. Furthermore it will explore what participants would expect during a political study trip. To educate Swedish municipalities there has to be a spread (diffusion) of Dutch bicycle innovations. Therefore the presence of the conditions for diffusion of innovation will be studied. Additionally, a political study trip to The Netherlands for Swedish municipalities will be developed. This study will be partly conducted for Cykelframjandet, an organisation that promotes; cycling in Sweden.; Methodologies: Next to theoretical research, a qualitative study has been carried out to meet the objectives of the research. Seven semi-structured face-to-face interviews with politicians and civil servants in four Swedish municipalities were conducted.; Findings: In general, respondents are interested in a political study trip to the Netherlands. Moreover, they think it will be useful. Several elements that positively influence the process of diffusion are present. However, according to the respondents, it will be difficult for Swedish municipalities to actually implement new bicycle policies although they (possibly) would want to. The expectation of a study trip differs among the respondents. Further research is needed in order to explore if more Swedish municipalities would be interested in a study trip and if positive conditions for diffusion will lead to policy diffusion and maybe even the implementation of new policies.; Implications: This study connects present literature with bicycle policies on the municipal level. Further it presents a model with elements that can influence the adoption of innovation. Finally it provides an advice for a three-day political study trip for Swedish municipalities to the Netherlands.",,,,,Public economics; Political science; Order (exchange); Qualitative research; Theoretical research; Municipal level; Civil servants; Public relations; Politics,,,,,https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/2795/,https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/2795/,,,113027634,,0,,0,false,,

Recent developments at the state and national levels offer two broad lessons for the study of policy diffusion. First, the most relevant political factors for the adoption decision depend on the specific policy tool under review. The spread of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, a more collaborative policy approach, was affected by institutional capacity and interest group politics. In contrast, the spread of state click through laws, a more individualistic approach, was influenced by fiscal concerns, partisanship, and policies in neighboring states. Second, a close analysis of the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 suggests that policy change at the state level can affect the agenda and terms of the congressional debate even if individual lawmakers do not necessarily learn from what occurs in the “laboratories of democracy.”",,,,,Click-through rate; Political economy; Individualism; Political science; State (polity); Use tax; Policy learning; Institutional capacity; Public administration; Federalism; Politics,,,,,https://myweb.uiowa.edu/fboehmke/shambaugh2014/papers/Karch%20Rosenthal%20Iowa%20Conference.pdf,https://myweb.uiowa.edu/fboehmke/shambaugh2014/papers/Karch%20Rosenthal%20Iowa%20Conference.pdf,,,2189074843,,0,000-860-250-635-640; 001-481-906-279-295; 001-866-484-635-954; 002-557-636-257-591; 002-772-581-900-237; 006-201-605-314-088; 011-081-694-389-715; 011-805-791-178-275; 012-883-251-761-670; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-507-965-164-922; 023-672-511-213-267; 034-431-213-473-281; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 039-664-709-632-96X; 049-561-974-880-973; 049-660-819-007-414; 050-082-471-457-812; 051-908-645-824-972; 055-657-149-763-463; 058-071-798-060-611; 061-386-905-024-830; 062-661-535-469-495; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-009-455-326-587; 072-830-196-099-537; 075-046-752-556-824; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-413-548-207-63X; 078-544-962-568-939; 086-148-759-903-581; 092-203-049-604-110; 096-517-829-236-651; 101-127-387-013-017; 106-352-974-752-749; 109-162-645-584-66X; 109-723-950-284-919; 115-967-910-800-171; 116-353-242-414-709; 119-410-370-897-909; 142-730-058-228-029; 148-460-439-813-652; 149-407-118-840-717; 159-383-479-361-446; 170-317-063-640-700; 174-768-369-809-642; 198-034-430-621-592,0,false,,

However, it is not clear under what conditions these policies get transferred, implemented or subsequently abandoned, especially in developing countries where LGs’ capacity to mainstream adaptation barely exist. Based on retrospective literature analysis, this article adduces theoretical and empirical evidence to analyze the factors likely to influence the mainstreaming of adaptation into local governance in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The outcome of the article is expected to help policy practitioners and academics to comprehend the preconditions that enhance or frustrate the adoption of adaptation policy innovations across LGs in SSA where adaptation remains critical developmental concerns. The preponderance of literature suggests that multiple factors, including those, outside the control of LGs affect their capacity and urgency to adopt adaptation policies. The chapter concludes that it is worthwhile to adopt multiple diffusion perfectives that reflect the complex web of factors conspicuously affecting the transfer of climate policy innovations at the micro level to explain the adoption of adaptation policies. The chapter argues that, by doing so, one is able to portray the nature of climate change policy diffusion in local governance in a more sophisticated, comprehensive and logical manner. The chapter therefore makes useful contributions to the emerging field of climate policy and provides useful lessons for practitioners on the factors that influence the adoption of adaptation policies.",,,65,85,Public economics; Climate change; Mainstreaming; Empirical evidence; Political science; Control (management); Mainstream; Local government; Developing country; Adaptation (computer science),,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-72874-2_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-72874-2_4,,10.1007/978-3-319-72874-2_4,2790801556,,0,000-299-078-954-023; 001-184-865-047-453; 002-068-832-668-622; 004-459-739-444-545; 008-740-849-508-220; 013-731-270-122-755; 015-475-716-108-652; 015-591-021-271-179; 017-698-517-909-300; 019-731-055-680-787; 023-732-423-762-102; 026-353-850-991-072; 030-992-254-739-896; 031-011-035-613-076; 031-762-133-647-285; 032-237-266-139-779; 033-340-354-398-22X; 035-349-229-513-894; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-285-296-358-192; 041-893-934-781-161; 041-990-913-892-713; 043-841-491-357-676; 045-497-245-998-964; 049-219-615-824-319; 053-728-397-381-424; 057-197-516-543-293; 057-671-454-035-749; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-229-452-361-959; 059-316-455-051-712; 060-111-029-519-921; 063-100-043-058-426; 064-086-404-072-222; 065-442-247-015-017; 066-074-336-832-14X; 066-570-148-008-80X; 067-490-686-317-462; 072-292-586-822-350; 073-643-989-439-143; 076-240-693-922-091; 079-072-262-352-436; 083-990-503-936-676; 086-458-122-923-255; 094-833-112-635-235; 096-517-829-236-651; 100-580-372-997-18X; 101-127-387-013-017; 106-912-995-967-397; 107-605-926-265-849; 114-170-229-596-750; 120-759-970-811-037; 128-355-765-988-239; 139-127-228-761-762; 139-444-636-777-770; 139-502-278-782-088; 156-409-360-782-562; 158-837-741-913-283; 163-637-734-144-951; 164-720-618-532-58X; 167-628-652-580-515; 175-664-767-683-619; 195-450-010-787-610,1,false,,

Hall; Donald J. Lacombe; Maria Tackett,"In recent years, a number of papers have looked at the adoption and diffusion of taxes across national, state, and local governments. Spending pressures, reductions in tax collection costs, median voter preferences, and social learning have been found to play an important role in the adoption of the income tax. Spatial econometrics were used to study the diffusions of income taxes across states from 1900 to 2010. Using United States Census Bureau data, negative spatial autocorrelation in income tax adoption was found. This is consistent with Tiebout competition reducing the likelihood of income tax adoption. States whose neighbors adopted income taxes were less likely to do so.

However, adoption of charter schools can also depend on various government conditions, such as the availability of resources. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine whether charter schools are more commonly adopted under favorable government conditions. Using a panel data set from 45 counties in California between 2001 and 2012, our analysis demonstrates that charter schools are more commonly adopted when the government has many financial slacks.

Agrawal; Gregory A. Trandel,"Abstract We study the dynamics of policy diffusion when a first-moving jurisdiction that legalizes an activity reduces the probability of legalization in nearby later-acting jurisdictions. If a jurisdiction's firms can sell to neighboring residents, but if the good is competitively sold at every location, then policies converge: all jurisdictions legalize or all jurisdictions ban. If firms have some market power, and if the location of firms depends on the order of legalization, an early-adopting government may legalize, but an otherwise identical, but later-acting, neighboring government might not. This possible asymmetry is due to state dependence resulting from the initial distribution of firms following the first-mover's legalization. Empirically, counties that legalize the sale of fireworks first have more firework vendors just inside their border than counties that legalize later. Furthermore, counties have a longer duration to legalize fireworks if nearby counties have already adopted. State dependence resulting from a first-mover advantage contributes to the policy divergence of regulatory policies.",79,,103471,,Business; Government; Externality; Order (exchange); International economics; Market power; Jurisdiction; Legalization; Fireworks; Duration (project management),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/regeco/v79y2019ics0166046218301777.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046218301777,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2019.103471,,10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2019.103471,2974779487,,0,002-828-581-987-168; 003-925-062-469-490; 004-687-267-237-736; 004-706-510-680-633; 006-646-565-105-389; 006-723-849-473-251; 007-748-315-099-75X; 008-841-120-312-779; 014-427-221-635-431; 014-481-255-967-028; 014-683-423-584-997; 015-108-469-078-50X; 018-048-040-137-885; 020-645-820-625-481; 020-810-004-181-612; 021-401-660-265-784; 025-174-121-426-671; 028-602-652-569-484; 028-751-377-057-52X; 029-298-395-918-681; 031-763-669-008-11X; 032-141-773-446-785; 034-576-609-343-931; 035-170-701-092-473; 037-539-166-769-816; 040-504-125-990-520; 041-449-113-286-162; 042-605-941-280-071; 044-466-063-641-042; 046-591-974-622-040; 047-271-524-472-667; 049-325-321-564-530; 053-203-734-337-44X; 053-285-069-358-655; 053-338-610-478-492; 054-232-027-010-287; 055-456-009-061-426; 055-513-897-073-457; 058-479-362-375-478; 059-284-478-370-544; 059-673-264-634-582; 064-854-703-068-396; 065-240-336-064-464; 067-288-546-933-213; 067-850-267-600-112; 068-256-422-613-728; 071-190-469-302-627; 071-756-278-100-723; 074-763-994-701-014; 075-189-033-456-892; 080-451-913-470-440; 081-775-933-809-971; 082-330-766-691-690; 083-315-278-785-680; 084-367-432-559-544; 085-227-480-558-310; 086-629-061-440-156; 088-062-843-972-331; 091-951-979-436-261; 092-333-839-560-891; 093-817-186-690-425; 094-416-227-691-213; 095-975-470-058-562; 099-560-635-567-383; 100-434-456-541-280; 101-962-938-428-841; 102-110-016-718-080; 104-374-502-477-798; 106-609-257-963-659; 110-241-067-104-433; 113-852-337-995-101; 116-409-022-533-343; 122-931-467-779-257; 124-319-143-972-626; 124-759-926-433-396; 126-427-768-556-228; 127-807-528-981-832; 133-141-557-324-400; 138-335-719-527-313; 138-574-000-131-228; 141-459-993-574-836; 144-970-246-875-245; 149-808-677-878-292; 153-113-115-763-489; 156-832-063-830-730; 163-156-699-022-475; 164-856-179-795-144; 168-536-856-668-787; 171-451-441-311-036; 171-497-239-229-358; 173-240-390-629-361; 177-089-335-862-917; 187-299-443-538-039; 197-729-564-674-395; 198-287-519-876-263,2,true,,green

Taber; Jamie F. Chriqui; Frank J. Chaloupka,"BACKGROUND: School district wellness policies designed to reduce obesity and promote student health and well-being often lack specific requirements or any mandate that schools comply with the policy. Researchers, educators, and policymakers have called for states to take an active role in shaping district policies. The objective of this study was to determine if states with strong school-based nutrition and physical activity (PA)-related policies have stronger district wellness policies, and explore the direction of policy diffusion between states and districts.; ; ; ; METHODS: State policies and nationally representative samples of district policies for the 2006–2007 and 2008–2009 school years were obtained across 5 domains—competitive foods, school meals, nutrition education, physical education (PE), and PA—and were classified as “strong” or “weak,” based on policy language, in each grade level (elementary, middle, high). Linear models estimated the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between state and district policies.; ; ; ; RESULTS: In 2006–2007 and 2008–2009, district elementary school competitive food policies were stronger in states with strong policies. For policies governing competitive foods in high schools and school meals at all grade levels, mean district policy strength increased from 2006–2007 to 2008–2009 in states with strong 2006–2007 policies. States that strengthened their PE policies from 2006–2007 to 2008–2009 saw an increase in mean district PE policy strength. Across all domains, states that had weak 2006–2007 policies and made no changes saw little increase in district policy strength.; ; ; ; CONCLUSION: District competitive food, school meal, and PE policies are stronger in states that have developed strong policies in these domains.",82,5,201,209,Public economics; Policy analysis; Health promotion; Pedagogy; Mandate; School meal; Well-being; Nutrition Education; Competitive foods; Physical education; Medicine,,Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Health Policy; Humans; Local Government; Nutritional Requirements; Obesity/prevention & control; Policy Making; Schools; State Government; United States,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1746-1561.2012.00688.x https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20123154725 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22494090 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1013519 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22494090,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1746-1561.2012.00688.x,22494090,10.1111/j.1746-1561.2012.00688.x,2030054181,,0,003-917-287-766-226; 005-025-222-761-060; 005-764-321-328-923; 006-752-441-241-572; 007-297-299-682-901; 011-279-743-205-585; 013-035-909-114-870; 016-352-209-254-002; 019-894-253-207-460; 021-272-438-097-97X; 026-203-245-080-277; 036-125-413-420-157; 036-349-334-296-672; 037-618-417-312-606; 039-504-521-005-523; 045-102-247-355-795; 045-137-589-592-889; 048-746-349-072-756; 050-082-471-457-812; 053-701-830-324-413; 074-584-700-482-036; 077-056-746-243-073; 109-606-194-407-334; 155-443-136-211-32X,25,false,,

This study attempts to explain the process by which childbirth support policies have spread among localities over time by addressing two questions: whether interjurisdictional and internal factors of policy diffusion have been at work; and how vertical and horizontal diffusion mechanisms have interactively affected local policy adoptions in the developing country. Empirical findings show that horizontal and vertical mechanisms of diffusion considerably outperform intrajurisdictional factors in spreading childbirth support policies among localities. Furthermore, the vertical influence from the central government has a positive conditional effect that stimulates horizontal interactions among local governments for policy formulation. These findings thus suggest t...",39,4,582,599,Decentralization; Economics; Work (electrical); Decentralised system; Local government; Population; Development economics; Horizontal and vertical; Central government; Economic system; Developing country,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03003930.2012.726200,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03003930.2012.726200,,10.1080/03003930.2012.726200,2041813738,,0,003-592-471-884-916; 012-286-853-432-764; 012-883-251-761-670; 014-694-012-786-985; 018-454-798-334-448; 033-977-823-096-135; 036-961-749-635-681; 050-082-471-457-812; 051-211-219-438-622; 058-071-798-060-611; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-909-874-772-91X; 069-419-171-325-456; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-926-704-396-107; 078-544-962-568-939; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-787-681-556-687; 094-833-126-001-305; 098-317-151-036-205; 101-127-387-013-017; 106-352-974-752-749; 111-759-980-707-405; 131-900-393-723-959; 141-801-844-621-791; 147-925-177-917-478; 148-460-439-813-652; 155-580-858-393-517,11,false,,

043-480-074-921-909,The (Re)Federalization of Fracking Regulation,2013-08-26,2013,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Michael Burger,"Controversies surrounding the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” have engaged the nation in a heated and broad ranging conversation about energy development and environmental protection in America. The debate over who should regulate fracking — the federal government or the States — has been front and center. This Article argues that a theoretical federalism analysis favors shared federal-state regulation of potential impacts on underground drinking water supplies and of hazardous waste management, and federal regulation of information disclosure, under the existing regimes created by our environmental laws. The Article makes at least four contributions to the literature on environmental federalism, in general, and on federalism and fracking, in particular. First, it sets forth a detailed theoretical argument in favor of federal regulation of fracking, and refutes theoretical arguments in favor of State regulation. Second, it provides a unique and extensive examination of the language, structure, and purposes of the Safe Drinking Water Act, along with its legislative history; this act of statutory interpretation provides much needed substance to what is too often an essentially political argument about who should regulate fracking’s potential to contaminate drinking water supplies. Third, it analyzes current state and federal regulation and prospective next steps through a federalism lens. Finally, the Article examines the issue of the appropriate scale of governance in light of the political science literature on policy diffusion. Ultimately, while the idea of the States serving as “laboratories for democracy” is an important one, it is not living up to its potential here, and federal intervention is the only way to achieve appropriate regulation of fracking’s environmental impacts.",,,,,Political science; Law and economics; Law; State (polity); Legislative history; Political argument; Statutory interpretation; Safe Drinking Water Act; Argument; Federalism; Intervention (law),,,,,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2327898 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2327898,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2327898,,,890725616,,0,,1,false,,

Micinski; Gerasimos Tsourapas,"Do states in the Global South learn from each other regarding the management of forced migration? Although research has shown that refugees have recently been recast as an economic benefit for non-Western host states, little scholarly work exists on whether and how such a normative change is adopted across regions. In this article, we identify the diffusion of refugee rent-seeking behaviour, namely the use of host states’ geopolitical position as leverage to extract revenue from other states in exchange for maintaining refugees within their borders. We identify three types of diffusion – learning, cooperation and emulation – occurring at state, regional and international levels across the Global South. Drawing on a range of primary sources, we demonstrate the working of these three types across a range of empirical examples drawn from the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Overall, we identify a rising trend in the commodification of forced migration across refugee rentier states, while highlighting the need for further interregional research on policy diffusion outside the Global North.",42,11,2747,2766,Refugee; Political science; Revenue; Geopolitics; Economic geography; State (polity); Forced migration; Commodification; Foreign policy; Rent-seeking,,,,,http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/246937/ https://faculty.up.edu.pe/en/publications/refugee-commodification-the-diffusion-of-refugee-rent-seeking-in- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2021.1956891,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2021.1956891,,10.1080/01436597.2021.1956891,3193238447,,0,003-146-962-532-464; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-722-686-316-360; 008-517-764-949-068; 011-110-725-200-71X; 013-753-441-575-394; 014-479-763-475-473; 015-462-036-157-247; 017-225-551-710-645; 019-245-418-464-028; 019-451-633-038-176; 020-360-499-989-430; 026-412-549-797-331; 029-770-466-130-549; 030-343-667-641-467; 034-275-341-917-885; 035-261-961-935-32X; 041-772-223-408-378; 048-084-385-775-90X; 050-466-073-472-147; 051-261-109-912-085; 051-396-619-486-803; 058-389-953-470-988; 062-989-130-038-979; 068-806-218-324-957; 071-463-469-373-59X; 075-809-745-100-792; 078-887-114-683-04X; 078-953-983-875-839; 079-569-201-913-336; 082-365-302-151-805; 083-128-427-871-272; 087-864-183-565-463; 093-174-564-099-469; 098-384-677-896-947; 117-677-347-760-402; 119-395-596-496-961; 120-480-852-067-27X; 131-249-950-556-656; 137-895-471-899-138; 155-389-305-451-240; 161-098-199-302-360; 168-540-390-136-720; 172-526-500-841-994; 172-867-793-422-042; 178-146-635-143-556; 185-226-655-551-905; 197-361-564-376-256,8,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid
043-547-850-265-638,Empirical Modeling of Policy Diffusion in Federal States: The Dyadic Approach,,2008,journal article,Swiss Political Science Review,14247755; 16626370,Wiley,United States,Fabrizio Gilardi; Katharina Füglister,"Policy diffusion is a common phenomenon in federal states: indeed, one of the normative justifications of decentralized policy making is that it permits the development and spread of best practices. Following Berry and Berry (1990), event-history analysis has been the method of choice for the quantitative investigation of policy diffusion, but Volden (2006) has recently introduced a dyadic variant of this method in which units of analysis are not states but, instead, pairs of states. This article discusses the dyadic approach with a particular focus on the diffusion of policies in Switzerland. The goal is not to introduce a new method, but rather to provide a practical overview for researchers interested in using it. The article shows how the method has migrated from the international relations literature to the policy-diffusion literature, describes the typical structure of a dyadic dataset in a diffusion context, and discusses several modeling issues. The usefulness of the dyadic approach is illustrated empirically with the example of health-insurance subsidy policies in Swiss cantons.",14,3,413,450,Economics; Microeconomics; Best practice; Structure (mathematical logic); Context (language use); International relations; Public relations; Normative; Federalism; Unit of analysis; Subsidy,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/11251480 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1662-6370.2008.tb00108.x https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/5859/ http://www.fabriziogilardi.org/resources/papers/Gilardi-Fueglister-SPSR-2008.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1662-6370.2008.tb00108.x https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/5859/1/gilardiV.pdf http://www.zora.uzh.ch/5859/1/gilardiV.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1662-6370.2008.tb00108.x,,10.1002/j.1662-6370.2008.tb00108.x,2036866299,,0,003-193-896-799-954; 003-825-600-967-940; 003-866-641-424-249; 005-503-339-286-965; 006-410-508-275-76X; 008-071-005-123-552; 010-895-739-894-552; 011-497-790-292-357; 014-105-600-284-553; 014-807-334-336-096; 015-007-962-146-155; 015-312-925-365-683; 018-446-657-280-351; 020-526-220-354-815; 021-216-291-636-927; 023-843-404-656-218; 025-112-618-417-304; 028-670-079-975-07X; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-857-383-799-592; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-818-459-512-182; 046-833-607-468-159; 048-222-432-062-519; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-671-315-820-339; 062-877-575-225-439; 063-400-296-712-427; 065-803-121-229-432; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-121-006-432-261; 074-440-638-968-971; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 080-919-080-194-701; 081-561-435-579-743; 084-325-208-115-548; 084-439-721-812-26X; 084-787-681-556-687; 088-993-237-313-315; 091-729-566-642-692; 094-833-126-001-305; 099-281-186-420-121; 101-127-387-013-017; 112-238-569-307-615; 112-333-966-495-520; 113-192-852-235-042; 118-513-543-976-791; 131-900-393-723-959; 135-594-606-624-421; 136-385-280-813-120; 137-078-114-056-538; 139-186-190-548-754; 143-817-676-829-591; 155-580-858-393-517; 159-346-836-194-525; 163-076-040-775-567; 174-174-401-959-707,103,true,,green

Rather surprisingly, Europe remains an understudied area in the recent policy diffusion literature. This comes as a surprise because the European governance structure provides an ideal setting for applying the theories and methods of diffusion, given that policy-making in Europe is embedded in a vertically and horizontally integrated network of jurisdictions. This chapter explores the overlaps and distinctions between the scholarships on policy diffusion and European public policy and discusses how the advances of the more recent policy diffusion literature could stimulate further European public policy research. Particularly, the approach of diffusion scholars to study the mechanisms of interdependent policy-making with data on the connectedness between jurisdictions has great potential for improving our understanding of European public policy-making.",,,621,633,Public economics; Public policy; Impact assessment; Political economy; Business; Interdependence; Policy studies; Surprise; Corporate governance; Education policy; Horizontal integration,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-55269-3_32 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-55269-3_32 https://boris.unibe.ch/144747/ https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/144530/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/978-1-137-55269-3_32,,10.1057/978-1-137-55269-3_32,2769328941,,0,000-267-571-130-101; 003-412-189-797-295; 003-628-352-044-22X; 004-336-147-101-733; 014-998-066-812-811; 022-439-947-732-749; 025-042-815-652-046; 026-412-549-797-331; 026-723-940-576-417; 026-897-684-454-102; 028-119-083-455-267; 031-248-920-440-257; 031-473-163-738-558; 031-922-115-482-536; 032-089-390-106-358; 034-277-783-905-290; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-316-736-908-394; 038-790-977-968-874; 043-027-207-713-420; 052-513-369-850-209; 063-643-701-913-238; 065-666-299-776-558; 074-128-358-343-524; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 101-127-387-013-017; 117-677-347-760-402; 125-268-617-755-543; 128-501-119-478-325; 139-186-190-548-754; 142-141-191-990-084; 144-505-966-780-435; 155-180-161-631-72X; 156-586-921-097-184; 157-471-694-925-950; 179-343-676-182-50X,3,false,,

How can the many variations and contradictions be explained, as well as the different responses and non-responses to European pressure? The contribution comprises three parts. The first discusses theories and conceptual tools. Both 'Europeanization' and 'health policy' are stretchable concepts. The paper shows how the different conceptions of health and health policy interact with the different conceptualisations of Europe and Europeanization. The second part provides empirical evidence from various areas of health policy. These field studies document European intervention, national implementation and feedback effects in a wide range of subjects, from market regulation of pharmaceuticals and other medical goods to political and public health issues, such as food safety, drug abuse, blood safety, and bio-ethics. The third part focuses on the results and draws conclusions: The Europeanization process is a move away from medical issues and problem framing, towards consumer and trade interests and conflicts. The multiple facets of European health policy integration result from an indirect impact, deriving from other Community provisions and policies, rather than from a direct Treaty-based impact. Three distinct sources of change and pressure for Europeanization are identified: market integration and compliance; public health 'crisis' and urgency; and policy diffusion and discourse. European health policy should be understood as an intersection between health policy and other policy fields; it develops as an issue-specific policy arena and as an incremental process.",,,,,Policy analysis; Public health; Empirical evidence; Political science; Policy studies; Treaty; Market integration; European union; Public administration; Health policy,,,,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00290381,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00290381,,,2746688138,,0,001-592-664-145-869; 002-459-562-088-377; 005-090-222-821-01X; 010-070-285-257-789; 015-620-700-303-937; 018-221-201-183-281; 020-242-915-003-54X; 022-916-996-914-257; 027-258-574-009-337; 039-207-763-803-754; 039-318-000-420-191; 048-360-754-795-518; 052-201-386-466-679; 055-204-557-481-527; 058-685-651-560-706; 062-255-864-022-439; 064-786-571-015-169; 071-273-278-682-43X; 076-666-469-476-89X; 079-130-632-566-902; 086-909-617-839-071; 087-672-113-340-684; 094-764-395-492-126; 097-160-736-704-441; 099-984-374-082-634; 104-759-609-040-569; 112-962-096-683-174; 131-779-320-851-720; 138-790-272-236-767; 145-681-225-660-056; 156-230-593-578-108; 158-836-132-040-304; 161-269-535-520-329; 162-684-061-321-495; 171-293-742-157-457,8,false,,

But what explains variation in the degree of influence that governing parties have on their foreign counterparts? We argue that clarity of responsibility within government, or the concentration of executive responsibility in the hands of a dominant governing party, allows parties to learn from the most obviously electorally successful incumbents. It therefore enhances the cross-national diffusion of party programs. To test this expectation, we analyze parties’ policy positions in twenty-six established democracies since 1977. Our results indicate that parties disproportionately learn from and emulate dominant, high-clarity foreign incumbents. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the political consequences of government clarity and sheds new light on the heuristics that engender party-policy diffusion by demonstrating that the most visible foreign incumbents, whose platforms have yielded concentrated power in office, influence party politics “at home.”",61,4,749,759,Heuristics; Political economy; Government; Political science; Power (social and political); CLARITY; Politics,,,,,https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/61/4/749/4781730 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/20416/ https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/58644/ http://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/61/4/749/4781730 https://core.ac.uk/display/96933718 https://core.ac.uk/download/96933718.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqx067,,10.1093/isq/sqx067,2779699469,,0,000-273-530-033-103; 000-651-285-581-426; 002-090-110-364-521; 002-577-980-557-663; 002-760-549-047-346; 003-238-661-289-980; 004-571-652-977-461; 004-788-411-104-755; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-439-868-038-998; 005-553-153-856-945; 005-679-832-871-024; 005-824-003-083-272; 006-072-850-561-64X; 009-568-078-394-10X; 010-003-191-094-552; 010-686-279-745-909; 010-947-899-562-815; 011-088-825-646-470; 013-025-567-518-242; 013-721-955-273-688; 015-753-547-305-299; 016-194-428-164-946; 018-599-489-876-11X; 018-614-791-953-545; 019-163-168-230-27X; 019-506-826-733-218; 019-568-476-801-56X; 020-991-739-278-672; 021-729-271-116-397; 022-953-565-007-586; 025-006-005-526-322; 026-180-760-698-101; 026-308-629-321-341; 026-775-594-060-761; 027-152-711-597-919; 028-597-737-481-330; 028-649-734-316-585; 028-961-821-306-058; 033-085-475-899-252; 035-061-927-263-746; 035-261-961-935-32X; 037-235-578-908-488; 039-412-520-002-824; 039-524-682-618-310; 040-438-905-073-640; 041-092-948-304-622; 041-483-417-025-323; 041-659-281-349-623; 042-848-125-795-604; 047-257-826-340-458; 048-384-936-724-987; 051-556-110-426-277; 052-957-372-948-888; 055-028-821-073-582; 055-532-729-324-361; 056-179-562-334-016; 056-672-370-150-588; 056-910-712-658-113; 058-418-465-913-030; 059-053-383-988-642; 061-162-133-058-674; 061-373-791-267-531; 061-973-970-085-871; 062-613-015-440-350; 064-671-173-784-907; 066-147-575-518-38X; 066-210-522-130-110; 066-381-099-354-26X; 067-791-588-273-557; 068-737-961-317-546; 070-992-501-063-733; 071-213-792-800-940; 073-030-626-169-04X; 075-089-695-295-014; 077-945-151-328-246; 080-378-424-661-571; 080-821-901-351-853; 082-007-314-468-658; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 083-620-105-108-236; 092-810-759-587-647; 095-211-909-469-422; 095-899-010-686-670; 098-480-504-720-169; 099-632-707-150-545; 100-254-044-576-841; 102-833-790-412-40X; 103-002-948-787-666; 105-521-696-637-174; 105-582-649-082-101; 111-649-892-201-407; 111-727-111-304-042; 112-260-575-033-076; 112-528-955-514-968; 115-292-903-924-077; 115-716-554-714-093; 117-677-347-760-402; 119-920-962-885-899; 120-125-912-662-50X; 122-321-798-500-697; 123-214-076-646-486; 124-543-671-647-444; 125-139-828-437-413; 125-146-296-341-319; 127-159-063-344-207; 127-990-084-200-828; 129-827-239-773-157; 132-681-646-135-346; 135-321-067-197-657; 137-051-141-347-832; 138-524-873-922-154; 142-237-274-537-919; 144-284-926-428-828; 145-975-486-752-358; 147-973-561-789-892; 148-223-435-969-407; 148-395-064-193-793; 148-624-417-685-66X; 149-072-106-176-247; 151-069-248-817-278; 155-840-578-843-016; 156-586-921-097-184; 157-471-694-925-950; 159-181-978-216-723; 160-246-248-886-215; 162-196-644-044-968; 163-362-622-998-450; 165-365-808-288-090; 170-851-664-310-256; 173-043-949-737-572; 176-381-994-269-676; 178-688-412-473-415; 179-348-929-516-428; 199-091-089-481-262,14,true,,green

Notwithstanding the differences in capacities and motivations based on the domestic political and economic contexts, there is a convergence of practices and policies of diaspora engagement among Latin American countries driven by the common challenges faced by their migrant populations in the United States and by the Latino population more generally. These policies, framed as an issue of rights protection and the promotion of migrants’ well-being, are presented as a form of regional solidarity and unity, and are also mobilized by the Mexican government as a political instrument serving its foreign policy goals.</p>",,,,,Political economy; Political science; Solidarity,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190688578.003.0004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190688578.003.0004,,10.1093/oso/9780190688578.003.0004,2801942495,,0,,0,false,,

A microprocessual two-level analysis (outside-in as well as inside-access) is employed to analyse transnational and domestic exchanges. The study provides evidence that low-carbon agenda-setting – introduced by transnational actors, backed by foreign funding, promoted by policy entrepreneurs from domestic research institutes, propelled by top-level attention, but only gradually and cautiously adopted by the government bureaucracy – can be considered a case of effective transnational diffusion based on converging perceptions of novel policy challenges and options. Opinion leaders and policy-brokers from the government-linked scientific community functioned as effective access points to the Chinese government’s policy agenda.",42,1,199,215,Political economy; Opinion leadership; Government; Economics; China; Climate policy; Environmental policy; Economic growth; Bureaucracy,,,,,https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jcca/article/view/596/ https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/186810261304200108,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/186810261304200108,,10.1177/186810261304200108,2138795171,,0,008-180-005-498-322; 008-881-886-538-014; 009-664-542-210-74X; 018-071-143-767-172; 024-244-831-621-580; 027-504-291-769-054; 043-152-923-486-225; 058-192-298-702-156; 077-719-089-159-967; 148-460-439-813-652; 192-339-567-858-215,5,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Pal,"Policy transfer, diffusion and circulation studies are a fertile ground for innovation in public policy analysis. In a globalized world, where state boundaries are permeable and public policy travels transnationally, the diffusion of policies is what naturally connects domestic to international policy. The recent surge of publications in the field consolidated an important and dense body of knowledge. However, after years of research, there now seems stasis if not stagnation, with relatively little conceptual innovation. In this article we propose to address fresh avenues for future research, considering what needs to be better understood in the policy diffusion phenomenon. The new frontiers to be explored are not only associated to heuristic dimensions of the field, but also to empirical dynamics that emerged in the past years. We highlight six new frontiers for policy transfer and diffusion research: (1) the role of the private sector and consultants; (2) internationalization of domestic coalitions; (3) transnational spaces and transfer agents; (4) policy translation; (5) resistance to transfer; and (6) South-South or South-North transfers.",52,2,199,220,Public policy; Private sector; Policy analysis; Political science; State (polity); Policy transfer; Field (Bourdieu); Phenomenon; Welfare economics; Internationalization,,,,,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rap/v52n2/1982-3134-rap-52-02-199.pdf https://www.scielo.br/j/rap/a/5Zntmj7bVs9ts9SC4yQwCws/ http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0034-76122018000200199&lng=en&tlng=pt http://www.scielo.br/j/rap/a/5Zntmj7bVs9ts9SC4yQwCws/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0034-761220180078,,10.1590/0034-761220180078,2807638812,,0,004-177-572-459-693; 012-467-150-825-142; 021-076-268-497-138; 023-672-511-213-267; 034-277-783-905-290; 043-126-321-736-910; 044-165-414-784-936; 045-175-598-457-061; 049-692-065-216-979; 050-274-654-059-514; 052-201-386-466-679; 069-240-874-291-053; 083-638-751-910-51X; 084-001-465-924-433; 084-787-681-556-687; 086-163-694-850-604; 087-551-225-721-384; 114-190-777-251-823; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-256-025-913-534; 119-549-543-398-232; 120-610-824-268-907; 120-796-629-160-114; 124-111-894-440-206; 125-268-617-755-543; 129-884-488-507-766; 129-973-570-078-256; 132-168-773-764-404; 132-579-595-475-314; 154-447-967-621-372; 163-715-791-108-616; 165-406-149-525-213; 170-140-304-042-672; 177-797-643-230-847; 183-246-970-375-644; 196-277-131-664-350; 196-954-048-210-361,29,true,cc-by,gold

Among public health standards, food safety standards were some of the first to be globalized, through the Codex Alimentarius Commission established in 1963. With the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO), these international food safety standards have taken on even greater importance, serving as a reference point for the WTO in resolving disputes between countries over trade barriers. Have these international food safety standards influenced domestic policies and, if so, in which directions and why?

Karch,"Despite many important advances in the study of policy diffusion, this research has overemphasized episodes of widespread adoption and underemphasized the rejection of innovations. This paper addresses that crucial gap in the existing scholarly literature by examining the politics of embryonic stem cell research in the American states. State officials had multiple policy options at their disposal, none of which gained widespread adoption. A systematic examination of bill introduction patterns between 1999 and 2008, however, suggests that this episode of non-diffusion was not due to a lack of awareness about these diverse options. Bill introduction, especially of proposals meant to facilitate the research, was widespread. The introduction of such enabling proposals was linked to strong state scientific capacity and a competitive political environment, while educational attainment and the state unemployment rate were linked to the introduction of enabling as well as restrictive legislation.",,,,,Political science; State (polity); Legislation; Educational attainment; State politics; Unemployment rate; Public administration; Development economics; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1642960,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1642960,,,2270554772,,0,013-730-587-959-962; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-456-406-334-322; 036-533-341-050-806; 048-222-432-062-519; 075-046-752-556-824; 076-240-693-922-091; 084-787-681-556-687; 091-980-709-376-628; 096-817-111-334-636; 101-127-387-013-017; 184-097-701-119-060,1,false,,

In an era characterized by heightened globalization and increasingly radical state restructuring, this question has become especially acute. Scholars of international relations offer a number of theoretical explanations for the cross-national convergence of ideas, institutions, and interests. We examine the proliferation of state bureaucracies for gender mainstreaming. These organizations seek to integrate a gender-equality perspective across all areas of government policy. Although they so far have received scant attention outside of feminist policy circles, these mainstreaming bureaucracies—now in place in over 100 countries—represent a powerful challenge to business-as-usual politics and policymaking. As a policy innovation, the speed with which these institutional mechanisms have been adopted by the majority of national governments is unprecedented. We argue that transnational networks composed largely of nonstate actors (notably women's international nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations) have been the primary forces driving the diffusion of gender mainstreaming. In an event history analysis of 157 nation-states from 1975 to 1998, we assess how various national and transnational factors have affected the timing and the type of the institutional changes these states have made. Our findings support the claim that the diffusion of gender-mainstreaming mechanisms has been facilitated by the role played by transnational networks, in particular by the transnational feminist movement.

047-920-531-337-321,High seas marine protected areas : concept and discourse analysis,2010-07-01,2010,dissertation,,,,,CF Hislop,"The notion of creating marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas has been hailed as “an idea whose time has come”, and advocates are calling for them to be part of a global representative system to be established by 2012. This thesis argues that embedding the high seas MPA concept within the macro-goal of a global representative system by 2012, and the high seas epistemic community’s persistence that this system be contained within an appropriate legal framework subsumes more pragmatic and politically acceptable “micro-actions”. I suggest an alternative approach, namely a ‘prototype’ high seas MPA established by means of an informal agreement between a small number of countries that share both political will and technological capacity to make a difference. Prototypes enable policy diffusion: a successful programme draws attention and establishes de facto standards that can be diffused laterally and adapted to similar problems elsewhere. Counter-intuitively, if unsuccessful, the experience can be used to clarify what to do differently in the future. ; ; The concept of a legally binding, globally representative system of high seas MPAs, and the fit this ‘macro-concept’ has within the vast and evolving global oceans governance ‘seascape’ is explored and critiqued against the backdrop of complex adaptive systems theory, components of international relations theory, and Rogers’ diffusions of innovation. Complex adaptive systems theory provides a metaphorical framework for analysing and evaluating the arguments and motivation of the oceans conservation epistemic community in relation to the concept of high seas MPAs.; ; This thesis argues that development of politically contentious conservation arrangements such as high seas MPAs may have a better chance of success if they proceed by increments and are negotiated outside the limelight of a full-scale, temporally defined global programme. I argue that international acceptance of the high seas MPA concept stands to benefit from a more politically cautious ‘micro-action’ – a prototype – modelled on the 2004 agreement to protect in situ the wreck and remaining artefacts of the Titanic (the Titanic Accord). A high seas MPA prototype would allow Parties to develop a collaborative and cooperative rules-based regime to manage the actions of their citizens involved in activities that may have a negative impact on a specific area of the marine environment.",,,,,Environmental resource management; International waters; Law and economics; International relations theory; Geography; Epistemic community; Corporate governance; Complex adaptive system; Marine protected area; Discourse analysis; Politics,,,,,https://eprints.utas.edu.au/11783/,https://eprints.utas.edu.au/11783/,,,128767198,,0,003-674-696-376-268; 005-434-063-054-592; 007-032-207-016-546; 007-939-690-189-695; 008-817-402-022-77X; 010-224-854-270-828; 017-432-417-244-067; 017-607-848-348-652; 021-555-865-303-926; 026-524-247-263-808; 032-564-511-569-763; 033-199-859-874-586; 039-318-000-420-191; 039-669-613-973-64X; 040-295-798-639-200; 041-171-907-351-778; 052-645-627-623-047; 053-843-348-301-153; 053-947-240-412-018; 054-706-056-753-727; 056-735-335-317-069; 063-816-178-888-615; 067-389-797-619-31X; 069-630-918-602-161; 071-049-891-626-712; 072-347-084-068-875; 078-044-409-703-823; 080-421-630-093-940; 082-379-524-159-340; 087-530-139-106-454; 091-791-449-601-733; 096-975-400-686-359; 097-772-274-500-846; 116-525-700-014-12X; 118-899-363-722-529; 130-850-079-506-826; 131-369-150-408-264; 132-983-946-257-664; 133-077-461-345-617; 145-221-450-097-362; 152-759-551-537-775; 153-810-508-476-273; 156-433-232-784-934; 157-308-550-392-85X; 158-355-145-035-806; 161-952-502-840-867; 166-292-906-662-72X; 167-019-421-912-435; 171-907-397-059-971,1,false,,

This article contributes to the policy literature by shedding light on the conditions, which incentivize countries to adopt more climate mitigation policies. The theoretical argument builds on the integrated approaches to study policy diffusion, which include both internal and external determinants as explanations for the adoption of policies. While previous applications typically operationalize the latter by regional proximity, this study highlights the added value of network dependencies capturing political and cooperative interactions across countries. The article finds that the adoption of climate policies is a matter of social influence. Countries are more likely to adopt policies if they cooperate with countries that have adopted more climate policies and are in a similar structural position to countries that are active in climate protection. This article not only is an important theoretical contribution to the policy literature but also enriches our methodological and empirical understanding of climate policy diffusion.",51,4,477,513,Public economics; Social network analysis; Climate change; Dynamic network analysis; Position (finance); Argument; Climate change mitigation; Added value; Operationalization,,,,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/159576/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-018-9332-6 https://boris.unibe.ch/127349/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/policy/v51y2018i4d10.1007_s11077-018-9332-6.html https://core.ac.uk/download/212393258.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-018-9332-6,,10.1007/s11077-018-9332-6,2890105520,,0,000-803-694-602-443; 003-592-471-884-916; 003-770-479-905-370; 004-425-339-520-048; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-282-272-395-98X; 007-535-183-204-490; 010-278-292-671-040; 011-232-096-560-186; 014-732-577-672-461; 015-140-269-492-01X; 017-698-517-909-300; 018-358-569-970-029; 019-532-888-914-451; 019-964-525-108-513; 021-504-790-021-683; 022-992-264-105-520; 026-412-549-797-331; 028-036-391-068-564; 030-618-332-643-890; 033-969-989-312-301; 033-982-144-935-167; 036-686-527-348-341; 037-563-113-946-575; 043-521-148-598-533; 043-547-850-265-638; 046-559-893-931-319; 047-812-993-541-791; 048-636-185-791-713; 051-123-350-149-527; 055-191-494-482-943; 061-818-193-542-192; 067-411-940-839-437; 072-862-908-678-93X; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-705-279-782-684; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-089-312-064-709; 079-463-144-448-689; 079-705-757-170-703; 080-562-049-013-811; 080-867-950-122-161; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-458-128-571-227; 087-097-726-965-347; 087-685-216-137-50X; 088-970-978-435-553; 090-738-237-848-225; 091-287-290-060-61X; 092-325-370-075-257; 093-195-829-732-024; 094-833-126-001-305; 095-259-472-977-565; 096-548-920-809-272; 096-934-353-851-882; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-808-810-392-557; 104-160-837-429-807; 105-526-785-996-251; 105-621-114-125-08X; 106-686-726-450-979; 106-931-835-220-458; 110-309-926-544-567; 113-855-460-838-05X; 114-410-567-464-603; 116-110-592-873-749; 118-513-543-976-791; 119-604-771-895-387; 119-609-681-852-300; 122-488-665-403-652; 128-196-316-913-500; 128-412-145-076-659; 129-330-344-786-837; 130-371-000-678-134; 130-506-519-418-836; 135-609-513-857-209; 156-586-921-097-184; 156-637-800-666-886; 165-407-200-296-685; 167-275-555-617-549; 173-238-855-181-673; 188-332-136-393-173; 188-697-996-806-339; 190-318-356-779-810; 199-741-976-278-991,37,true,,green

Garrett; Joshua M. Jansa,"Scholars have suggested that interest groups affect the diffusion of innovations across states by creating a network of information between the states that aids in the spread of policy ideas. Still, the unique role that interest groups play in policy diffusion networks is not fully understood, in large part because the current methodology for studying diffusion cannot parse out interest group influence. We address this problem by analyzing the actual text of legislation, moving away from binary adoption to a more nuanced measure of policy similarity. This allows us to distinguish whether states emulate other states or interest group model legislation. We use text similarity scores in a social network analysis to explore whether early-adopting states or interest groups are more central to the network. We apply this analytical framework to two policies—abortion insurance coverage restrictions and self-defense statutes. Based on this analysis, we find that a fundamentally different picture of policy diffusion networks begins to emerge—one where interest group model legislation plays a central role in the diffusion of innovations.",15,3,387,417,Social network analysis; Economics; Statute; Microeconomics; Parsing; Legislation; Similarity (psychology); Diffusion of innovations; Network analysis; Public relations; Sociological theory of diffusion,,,,,http://kgarrett.web.unc.edu/files/2014/08/Garrett_Writing-Sample_Publication.pdf https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/abs/interest-group-influence-in-policy-diffusion-networks/2E440AE9A7838D1841E229B78D81F785 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532440015592776 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532440015592776 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532440015592776 http://spa.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1177/1532440015592776,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532440015592776,,10.1177/1532440015592776,2135742381,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 002-557-636-257-591; 005-692-270-875-15X; 012-883-251-761-670; 015-224-334-535-169; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-507-965-164-922; 021-820-432-690-769; 023-082-418-955-549; 027-835-981-532-333; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-182-595-543-44X; 033-969-989-312-301; 036-961-749-635-681; 040-574-713-769-455; 041-406-016-442-127; 043-418-719-602-52X; 044-958-408-877-837; 049-084-800-183-79X; 057-621-004-140-001; 061-793-046-506-062; 064-753-387-756-134; 065-296-005-360-202; 067-490-686-317-462; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 079-431-541-601-150; 084-787-681-556-687; 085-535-301-648-519; 095-179-619-530-275; 096-362-816-439-456; 098-317-151-036-205; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 123-288-456-400-05X; 127-807-528-981-832; 143-817-676-829-591; 155-580-858-393-517; 174-768-369-809-642; 176-503-345-697-964; 184-097-701-119-060; 196-404-637-819-988,53,false,,

Both models contend that decision-making occurs laterally as state legislators learn from or react to the policy decisions of other elites; the public is but a minor facet of policy diffusion. I offer a third explanation, the social contagion model, which makes public opinion the driving force behind elite decision making. The social contagion model suggests that state residents learn about neighboring policies and react by changing their aggregate opinions on that policy. If state opinion becomes supportive, state officials respond by enacting similar policies or risk being ousted from office. Using a dataset on anti-smoking legislation from 1990-2008, I find empirical support for the social contagion model.",,,,,Empirical research; Complex contagion; Public opinion; Political economy; Emotional contagion; Political science; Elite; State (polity); Legislation; Mechanism (sociology); Public relations,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1658071_code1321307.pdf?abstractid=1657263&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1657263,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1657263,,,854171811,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 005-261-328-376-894; 006-249-194-363-768; 007-867-762-265-299; 010-374-580-211-698; 011-659-464-522-304; 015-591-021-271-179; 015-865-297-475-960; 016-324-311-599-72X; 017-277-944-387-775; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-456-406-334-322; 029-310-211-233-741; 030-530-785-536-071; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-774-298-508-508; 035-297-063-857-635; 036-961-749-635-681; 041-515-541-640-423; 045-331-169-768-170; 048-616-037-883-642; 048-749-265-167-655; 050-082-471-457-812; 057-621-004-140-001; 065-296-005-360-202; 066-008-891-403-656; 067-399-200-833-428; 068-077-110-211-259; 068-521-008-015-559; 069-886-965-483-619; 072-593-731-120-128; 073-753-993-648-180; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-849-412-257-213; 084-588-709-311-015; 084-594-834-967-153; 089-769-913-312-60X; 091-586-144-045-630; 091-736-584-918-934; 094-569-126-108-938; 096-362-816-439-456; 096-958-954-905-82X; 098-419-626-337-536; 099-632-707-150-545; 101-011-229-347-877; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 103-349-006-601-699; 124-843-619-524-361; 127-539-841-332-937; 128-543-209-099-615; 131-596-606-270-487; 137-674-676-505-121; 138-176-816-462-317; 140-882-984-483-643; 142-090-880-007-148; 145-378-977-649-202; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-704-759-830-058; 163-926-847-617-824; 178-927-906-303-374,0,false,,

A comparative study of digital equity plans of four large US cities,2021-12-01,2021,journal article,The Journal of Community Informatics,17124441,University of Waterloo,,Caroline Stratton,"<jats:p>The term digital equity is at the forefront of municipal government planning to mitigate digital equity. Digital equity signifies a desired future to be achieved, yet its meaning is not well-established. As such, planning for digital equity offers an opportunity for new discursive construction. This study examines how municipal governments have constructed the concept of digital equity through textual evidence, the digital equity plans of Kansas City, MO, Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA, and Seattle, WA. Adopting an approach from critical discourse studies, comparative analysis of the texts demonstrates how digital equity plans conceive of digital equity, characterize current problematic circumstances, and prescribe actions to make change. The plans have strikingly little to say about why digital inequality has emerged, yet they prescribe actions that indicate a more complex understanding of the problem than they articulate. The dynamics of policy diffusion suggest that the work of early adopters will influence other municipalities to create similar plans. Thus, the current moment is ripe for scholars to influence municipal planning for digital equity and participate in its discursive construction in both academic research and policymaking circles.&#x0D;;  </jats:p>",17,,,,Public economics; Business; Equity (finance); Status quo,,,,,https://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/JoCI/article/download/3576/5432,http://dx.doi.org/10.15353/joci.v17i.3576,,10.15353/joci.v17i.3576,3215203669,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc-sa,gold

VanDeveer,"This article analyzes how U.S. climate change politics and policy making are changing in the public, private and civil society sectors, and how such changes are likely to influence U.S. federal policies. It outlines the current status of U.S. climate change action and explores four overlapping pathways of policy change: (1) the strategic demonstration of the feasibility of climate change action; (2) the creation and expansion of markets; (3) policy diffusion and learning; and (4) the creation and promulgation of norms about the need for more aggressive climate change action. These four pathways seek to fruitfully draw from rationalist and constructivist approaches to policy analysis, without collapsing or confusing the different logics. Building on this analysis, it predicts that future federal U.S. climate policy will include six major components: (1) A national cap on GHG emissions; (2) A national market based cap-and-trade GHG emissions trading scheme; (3) Mandatory renewable energy portfolio standards; (4) Increased national product standards for energy efficiency; (5) Increased vehicle fleet energy efficiency standards; and (6) Increased federal incentives for research and development on energy efficiency issues and renewable energy development. In addition, expanding federal climate policy may bring about significant changes in U.S. foreign policy as U.S. international re-engagement on climate change is likely to occur only after the development of more significant federal policy.",24,1,1,27,Economic policy; Policy analysis; Climate change; Economics; Political economy of climate change; Policy studies; Efficient energy use; Incentive; Greenhouse gas; Economic growth; Foreign policy,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00265.x http://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/files/center/Global%20Governance/Documents/Selin%20Climate%20Policy.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bla:revpol:v:24:y:2007:i:1:p:1-27 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00265.x https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/revpol/v24y2007i1p1-27.html http://people.bu.edu/selin/publications/SelinVanDeveerRPR2007.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00265.x,,10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00265.x,2156352223,,0,002-676-305-612-132; 013-926-982-281-738; 015-274-136-875-643; 015-775-546-150-325; 017-392-063-577-425; 019-309-106-061-49X; 020-978-464-650-239; 023-614-842-112-254; 028-456-229-528-076; 029-132-650-373-165; 029-863-840-040-395; 032-227-470-168-48X; 041-258-031-359-59X; 041-851-572-740-884; 042-309-076-257-363; 042-471-303-468-159; 044-087-769-185-544; 044-599-310-331-578; 046-871-834-972-803; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-846-133-812-979; 052-201-386-466-679; 053-153-042-281-366; 054-478-415-747-504; 055-308-931-155-614; 056-933-392-007-005; 057-242-558-360-241; 058-306-828-354-340; 059-544-147-171-119; 064-382-345-912-127; 066-540-538-924-910; 069-083-398-009-769; 069-336-472-421-480; 069-759-508-218-607; 070-350-085-850-927; 074-145-195-732-246; 074-465-905-471-400; 076-437-309-668-973; 080-784-878-332-952; 084-620-742-388-361; 090-027-488-424-266; 094-116-136-916-064; 094-833-112-635-235; 097-231-143-041-801; 098-012-948-620-129; 098-658-224-449-285; 099-939-483-847-760; 099-951-699-982-162; 101-208-298-196-530; 102-936-558-969-379; 109-566-407-583-937; 111-619-327-021-131; 112-492-487-875-540; 117-873-064-277-697; 121-854-027-840-12X; 126-807-626-624-04X; 131-057-877-810-606; 131-508-560-498-271; 133-560-718-103-50X; 137-641-257-350-195; 138-860-491-363-732; 141-940-156-051-553; 145-758-015-342-300; 148-143-157-826-27X; 162-728-007-977-911; 168-893-302-826-793; 171-544-183-196-014; 183-684-664-751-795; 185-653-881-070-807; 197-210-681-408-984,116,true,,bronze

However, the formulation, adoption, and diffusion of the NEV policies have not been fully examined in the extant literature. This article explores the mechanisms driving the diffusion of local financial subsidy policy for NEVs in China. In this context, we aim at analyzing the factors affecting the diffusion of local financial subsidies for NEVs in cities, to explain why some cities have taken the lead in adopting local financial subsidy policies for NEVs, while other cities have lagged behind. Based on a data set of 286 cities in China from 2009 to 2016, and with event history analysis (EHA) to analyze the strategic behaviors of local governments, we found that the number of the city’s neighbors that have adopted the NEV policy, the financial incentive policy of the provincial government, the administrative ranking of the city, the city’s financial situation and innovation capacity have a direct impact on whether the city adopts a local financial subsidy policy for NEVs. This study has practical implications for policymakers in designing and promoting the spread of NEV policies.",17,3,726,,Finance; Energy policy; Business; Government; China; Ranking; Context (language use); Incentive; Poison control; Subsidy,event history analysis; local financial subsidy policy; new energy vehicles; policy diffusion,Automobiles/economics; China; Cities; Financial Support; Local Government; Public Policy,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/3/726 https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/3/726/pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31979153/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31979153,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17030726,31979153,10.3390/ijerph17030726,3001813859,PMC7037132,0,003-201-768-363-395; 004-395-693-795-330; 009-685-607-294-036; 009-968-127-501-702; 011-631-582-713-852; 015-730-979-037-687; 016-394-084-146-774; 024-051-508-215-354; 025-642-257-819-030; 026-527-729-268-410; 032-427-053-575-697; 032-688-455-906-482; 036-332-253-976-202; 036-861-932-910-786; 036-961-749-635-681; 045-523-360-878-577; 050-240-273-947-643; 057-440-181-740-62X; 057-657-809-679-383; 057-996-039-456-162; 058-071-798-060-611; 061-252-380-488-478; 063-855-166-945-821; 072-888-358-096-155; 073-234-766-527-667; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-413-548-207-63X; 078-475-330-427-103; 078-681-282-470-808; 084-154-879-306-982; 087-810-098-305-911; 093-861-925-204-733; 094-328-227-820-695; 097-505-245-032-987; 101-127-387-013-017; 105-699-443-257-139; 106-352-974-752-749; 107-294-051-396-217; 112-398-967-835-491; 113-678-199-401-81X; 113-979-004-712-204; 118-313-676-076-213; 119-352-637-242-459; 131-900-393-723-959; 142-464-204-425-700; 142-922-989-952-10X; 148-778-286-826-697; 153-261-049-530-314; 157-688-142-236-919; 159-642-100-006-452; 163-076-040-775-567,10,true,cc-by,gold

Nonetheless, the results of this paper suggest that states are more likely to adopt policing policies of other states if they are perceived to be successful in reducing the number of violent crimes performed compared to years past.",11,2,136,161,Public economics; Policy analysis; Economics; Policy studies; State (polity); Policy learning; Policy outcomes; Crime reduction; Public relations; Bureaucracy,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ids/ijilea/v11y2012i2p136-161.html https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/full/10.1504/IJIL.2012.045173,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/ijil.2012.045173,,10.1504/ijil.2012.045173,2150834769,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 002-001-931-874-062; 003-592-471-884-916; 004-855-229-320-07X; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-692-270-875-15X; 012-103-256-358-880; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-769-346-177-716; 020-046-597-557-636; 020-578-975-910-263; 021-216-291-636-927; 026-169-050-342-031; 026-412-549-797-331; 033-284-190-236-668; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-676-125-114-205; 036-961-749-635-681; 048-814-625-895-559; 048-878-015-117-277; 050-714-638-638-846; 053-355-760-297-149; 056-886-943-243-17X; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-584-207-510-275; 061-793-046-506-062; 065-485-651-784-029; 070-439-295-045-214; 070-679-517-543-722; 071-526-417-428-347; 072-312-974-217-588; 073-883-113-579-515; 076-109-279-034-853; 076-240-693-922-091; 079-389-460-379-467; 090-570-886-600-231; 095-179-619-530-275; 096-517-829-236-651; 097-362-043-964-465; 098-324-512-613-959; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 119-290-011-738-072; 122-074-498-765-196; 137-674-676-505-121; 149-895-188-637-023; 155-580-858-393-517; 157-788-505-297-488; 163-637-734-144-951; 165-474-891-923-085; 181-198-168-275-068; 190-392-550-785-478,0,false,,

Shipan; Craig Volden,"Studies of policy diffusion often focus on the horizontal spread of enactments from one state to another, paying little or no attention to the effects of local laws on state-level adoptions. For example, scholars have not tested whether local policy adoptions make state action more likely (through a snowball effect) or less likely (through a pressure valve effect). This study conducts the first comprehensive analysis of vertical policy diffusion from city governments to state governments, while simultaneously examining the influence of state-to-state and national-to-state diffusion. Focusing on three different types of antismoking laws, we find evidence that policies do bubble up from city governments to state governments. State politics are crucial to this relationship, however, as local-to-state diffusion is contingent on the level of legislative professionalism and the strength of health advocates in the state.",50,4,825,843,Top-down and bottom-up design; Diffusion (business); Political economy; Political science; State (polity); State politics; Local policy; State action; Public administration; Federalism; Legislature,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/amposc/v50y2006i4p825-843.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00218.x http://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/AJPS-2006-smoking.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00218.x,,10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00218.x,2019834961,,0,000-614-714-805-123; 001-328-701-270-077; 001-565-902-956-007; 005-261-328-376-894; 006-106-338-978-676; 008-359-079-785-535; 011-042-061-370-473; 012-747-361-741-885; 014-694-012-786-985; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-580-012-420-762; 023-418-371-753-320; 025-106-469-790-904; 027-251-121-567-123; 027-399-814-415-414; 031-542-155-211-664; 036-961-749-635-681; 041-060-453-644-434; 053-434-434-475-160; 054-917-172-837-602; 057-090-537-484-157; 061-386-905-024-830; 064-753-387-756-134; 066-008-891-403-656; 067-490-686-317-462; 070-439-295-045-214; 072-593-731-120-128; 072-830-196-099-537; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 081-840-373-163-25X; 081-963-078-042-359; 084-439-721-812-26X; 084-787-681-556-687; 086-155-518-024-549; 086-295-173-349-915; 086-786-776-616-409; 088-919-425-365-248; 093-830-324-609-012; 094-833-126-001-305; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 106-352-974-752-749; 109-581-103-469-815; 115-996-579-461-546; 121-916-230-399-721; 123-012-285-316-883; 124-030-738-371-603; 124-843-619-524-361; 127-807-528-981-832; 129-868-939-005-475; 131-900-393-723-959; 137-674-676-505-121; 141-402-405-160-411; 142-090-880-007-148; 143-627-368-363-26X; 145-463-093-374-983; 148-460-439-813-652; 150-961-458-885-966; 155-580-858-393-517; 175-078-050-560-257; 178-927-906-303-374; 187-397-656-450-670; 198-709-382-077-715,471,false,,

Policy diffusion is assumed to become more and more relevant also for welfare state development. This paper explicitly focuses on the policy diffusion among 21 OECD countries in the period between 1980 and 2007 looking at social spending dynamics. The empirical findings of the spatial regressions clearly indicate that spatial patterns in social spending dynamics are driven by policy diffusion processes. In fact, economic interdependencies define the pathways of diffusion. Trading partners move in the same direction regarding social policy behavior. Surprisingly, cultural and geographical proximity are less relevant for the diffusion processes, at least in terms of social spending dynamics.",19,2,123,138,Public economics; Welfare state; Diffusion (business); Spatial ecology; Economics; Interdependence; Social policy; Economic geography; Exchange of information; Closeness; Politics,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/spsr.12035 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spsr.12035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/spsr.12035,,10.1111/spsr.12035,2070242931,,0,000-568-850-247-424; 002-557-636-257-591; 005-249-461-623-469; 011-497-790-292-357; 014-420-171-880-92X; 017-170-773-275-495; 018-590-967-575-135; 021-216-291-636-927; 021-907-061-236-840; 025-112-618-417-304; 025-193-488-999-63X; 028-342-125-916-204; 037-477-778-556-546; 040-739-114-535-043; 043-506-165-559-979; 063-504-944-027-038; 065-666-299-776-558; 070-134-974-124-486; 070-150-985-024-413; 072-862-908-678-93X; 074-591-312-235-434; 077-926-704-396-107; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-022-394-011-890; 084-370-283-025-895; 085-034-227-045-860; 095-421-061-786-644; 095-484-603-028-775; 117-677-347-760-402; 145-428-474-771-751; 157-969-366-462-465; 162-938-313-131-514,6,false,,

It discusses the development of these ideas through the models of Dolowitz and Marsh, and Evans and Davies.

051-639-048-139-624,Inferring Policy Diffusion Networks in the American States,2022-02-07,2022,other,,,The University of Iowa,,Bruce A. Desmarais; Jeffrey J. Harden; Frederick J. Boehmke,"For decades scholars of state politics have studied the ways in which innovations in public policy diffuse across the states. Several studies indicate that policy diffusion is an explicitly dyadic process whereby states learn and adopt policies from their neighbors in geographic, social, economic, and political space. This dyadic diffusion process implies the existence of a policy diffusion network among the states. Using a dataset consisting of 189 policies, we introduce and apply algorithms designed to directly infer a diffusion network from a sample of policy adoption sequences. In addition to presenting the network inference algorithm, we offer three substantive contributions with regard to research on policy diffusion in the American states. First, we summarize and analyze the structure of the inferred diffusion network and assess the ways in which it has changed over the last several decades. Second, we demonstrate how the inferred diffusion network can be integrated into conventional statistical models of state policy adoption. Third, we estimate models to explain the pattern of diffusion ties and test a variety of theoretical expectations about who states choose to emulate.",,,,,Public policy; Statistical model; Diffusion (business); Variety (cybernetics); Econometrics; Political science; Structure (mathematical logic); Inference; Sample (statistics); Sociological theory of diffusion; Management science,,,,,https://ir.uiowa.edu/polisci_pubs/114/ https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/PolMeth/files/2013/07/DesmaraisHardenBoehmke.pdf https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1112&context=polisci_pubs,http://dx.doi.org/10.17077/ra4p-kxo9,,10.17077/ra4p-kxo9,2186514795,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 002-557-636-257-591; 004-682-225-354-448; 005-692-270-875-15X; 007-984-389-290-121; 010-860-188-762-798; 015-597-573-538-668; 017-043-019-210-938; 017-875-050-473-48X; 018-259-337-688-581; 018-454-798-334-448; 026-692-192-483-397; 027-168-228-674-060; 027-835-981-532-333; 033-969-989-312-301; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 039-664-709-632-96X; 044-076-888-604-154; 046-107-885-762-810; 050-082-471-457-812; 052-182-085-916-217; 057-621-004-140-001; 061-793-046-506-062; 062-989-965-372-326; 063-504-944-027-038; 065-296-005-360-202; 066-497-450-939-295; 070-864-109-684-352; 071-070-782-763-458; 076-240-693-922-091; 087-124-543-724-867; 101-709-103-228-13X; 105-282-956-706-039; 155-580-858-393-517; 155-694-442-652-007; 159-070-917-393-556; 174-768-369-809-642; 198-709-382-077-715,0,false,,

Ingram,"Existing research shows that the ideas of judges matter for judicial behavior both on the bench (decision making) and off the bench (lobbying and mobilization for institutional change). Yet there is little empirical evidence regarding the content and distribution of these ideas and even less evidence and fewer theoretical propositions regarding the manner in which ideas transfer or diffuse among judges. Addressing these empirical and theoretical gaps, I survey judges in the Mexican state of Michoacan and apply techniques of network analysis. The project makes four main contributions: (1) original data on the attitudes of judges regarding prominent institutional and jurisprudential changes shaping the legal landscape in Mexico; (2) egocentric data on network structure for the sampled judges; (3) sociocentric data on network structure at the level of judicial district, state supreme court, and entire state generated by aggregating the egocentric data; and (4) a mixed-methods analysis of the causal relationship between network features and judicial attitudes, drawing on egocentric methods, sociocentric methods, and personal interviews with focal individuals. Complementing literatures on political socialization, policy diffusion, and complex systems, the analysis clarifies our understanding of the role of judicial networks in strengthening democracy and the rule of law. 1 Prior drafts of this paper were presented at the 2012 meetings of the Midwest and Western Political Science Associations, the 2011 Political Networks conference, and the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, University of Notre Dame.

What discussion and analysis there is seems to ignore the insights and models prevalent in other domains. We looked to fields like political science, and economic and social development for concepts to strengthen the analysis of education policy mobility between nations. We found an abundance of metaphors most of which fail to capture key elements of policy diffusion including the notion that ideas change as they cross cultural boundaries. We observe that policy transfer can be purposefully initiated by the host as well as a product of coercion or external incentives. Our principal conclusions are that common framings of traveling education policies are linear, one-directional and marked by an air of beneficence. They overlook the importance of context and the actions of sovereign nations in policy formation.",6,3,83,93,Public policy; Beneficence; Comparative education; Political economy; Political science; Social change; Policy transfer; Context (language use); Incentive; Education policy,,,,,https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1272494.pdf http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1272494.pdf https://research.nu.edu.kz/en/publications/the-mobility-of-education-policy-in-the-21st-century-lessons-from https://journals.tdl.org/fire/index.php/FIRE/article/view/187 https://fire-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/fire/index.php/FIRE/article/download/187/102 https://fire-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/fire/index.php/FIRE/article/view/187 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1272494,http://dx.doi.org/10.32865/fire202063187,,10.32865/fire202063187,3092652827,,0,,4,true,,gold

Anderson; Geronimo Jimenez; Jin Yung Bae; Diana Silver; James Macinko; Maurizio Porfiri,"Detecting and explaining the relationships among interacting components has long been a focal point of dynamical systems research. In this paper, we extend these types of data-driven analyses to the realm of public policy, whereby individual legislative entities interact to produce changes in their legal and political environments. We focus on the U.S. public health policy landscape, whose complexity determines our capacity as a society to effectively tackle pressing health issues. It has long been thought that some U.S. states innovate and enact new policies, while others mimic successful or competing states. However, the extent to which states learn from others, and the state characteristics that lead two states to influence one another, are not fully understood. Here, we propose a model-free, information-theoretical method to measure the existence and direction of influence of one state's policy or legal activity on others. Specifically, we tailor a popular notion of causality to handle the slow time-scale of policy adoption dynamics and unravel relationships among states from their recent law enactment histories. The method is validated using surrogate data generated from a new stochastic model of policy activity. Through the analysis of real data in alcohol, driving safety, and impaired driving policy, we provide evidence for the role of geography, political ideology, risk factors, and demographic and economic indicators on a state's tendency to learn from others when shaping its approach to public health regulation. Our method offers a new model-free approach to uncover interactions and establish cause-and-effect in slowly-evolving complex dynamical systems.",15,3,1384,1409,Public policy; Ideology; Causality; Economic indicator; State (polity); Health policy; Complex system; Management science; Economic system; Politics,causality; complex dynamical systems; health policy; information theory; networks,,,NIAAA NIH HHS (R21 AA021523) United States,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/siamads/siamads15.html#AndersonJBSMP16 http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/15M1041584 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5654517 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29075163/ https://dx.doi.org/10.1137/15M1041584 https://locus.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1041584 https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/understanding-policy-diffusion-in-the-us-an-information-theoretic https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5654517/ https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1041584 https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1041584,http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/15m1041584,29075163,10.1137/15m1041584,2489801656,PMC5654517,0,000-059-077-153-627; 001-813-066-837-888; 001-883-776-490-085; 002-478-565-028-98X; 003-110-383-068-201; 004-152-004-103-09X; 004-361-120-962-108; 005-692-270-875-15X; 008-270-912-843-301; 008-743-924-030-276; 011-254-560-271-044; 017-289-320-253-742; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-973-262-741-998; 019-930-925-911-406; 020-726-584-247-451; 022-199-820-865-122; 033-824-215-528-451; 033-852-662-613-736; 035-277-646-815-316; 037-262-824-656-102; 039-017-647-412-804; 043-181-128-656-347; 046-798-147-655-138; 050-082-471-457-812; 056-760-259-147-401; 058-480-868-959-911; 059-917-475-444-007; 060-675-832-673-331; 061-165-206-384-838; 064-165-028-304-207; 065-947-470-594-588; 066-853-077-909-693; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-276-527-024-019; 069-737-541-852-346; 074-752-466-689-978; 076-240-693-922-091; 081-840-416-929-164; 086-626-197-562-538; 089-160-995-353-148; 091-963-542-755-516; 095-295-937-051-753; 098-936-508-449-890; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-488-954-100-242; 102-490-342-063-275; 102-558-954-580-896; 116-981-154-890-403; 123-834-542-909-202; 124-666-252-104-349; 125-222-260-020-558; 135-057-314-769-836; 136-913-660-590-455; 140-691-351-504-561; 155-580-858-393-517; 159-346-836-194-525; 174-768-369-809-642,14,true,,green

It draws on two policies, Bolsa Escola, an education program, and Programa Saude da Familia, a family health program, in four exemplary cities, to uncover the mechanisms that led to diffusion. Surpris- ingly, political incentives, such as electoral competition, cannot explain diffusion. Rather, ideology and socialized norms, transmitted through social networks, drive policy emulation. Diffusion occurs when politicians are ideologically compelled to replicate these programs and when policy specialists seek to demonstrate that they follow professional norms.",43,3,82,108,Sociology; Ideology; Social policy; Constitution; Diversity (politics); Incentive; Public administration; Social Welfare; Social network; Politics,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/20488151 https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/latin_american_research_review/v043/43.3.sugiyama.pdf https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/3321 https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/2152/3321/2/sugiyamad69603.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/lar.0.0057,,10.1353/lar.0.0057,2021754770,,0,002-835-452-789-988; 004-118-072-500-071; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-692-270-875-15X; 005-903-140-381-255; 006-379-047-886-492; 006-651-101-781-158; 006-887-221-214-562; 008-414-059-072-131; 011-316-396-438-455; 011-576-380-916-644; 012-274-705-340-368; 012-286-853-432-764; 015-591-021-271-179; 015-810-213-354-507; 017-050-707-046-41X; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-076-308-856-384; 019-300-676-397-605; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-020-293-269-648; 020-473-889-836-65X; 020-481-980-392-113; 021-427-320-115-267; 022-512-643-506-628; 022-929-722-558-331; 025-186-004-983-717; 025-264-106-797-983; 025-826-626-668-87X; 026-412-549-797-331; 027-380-118-005-972; 027-827-119-143-849; 028-407-052-046-096; 030-957-837-971-087; 031-318-852-376-118; 031-732-499-285-605; 031-762-133-647-285; 031-950-305-880-840; 032-164-929-841-901; 032-220-205-010-399; 032-799-163-433-232; 033-852-662-613-736; 034-420-438-940-369; 036-076-120-626-655; 036-152-544-454-000; 036-159-702-886-637; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-974-689-250-629; 039-540-123-998-767; 042-969-004-460-008; 043-773-437-159-618; 046-210-261-429-898; 046-276-426-729-138; 046-585-861-402-833; 046-841-674-135-16X; 046-871-834-972-803; 047-561-624-753-779; 047-708-937-749-969; 047-812-993-541-791; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-346-896-830-955; 048-528-031-050-826; 048-846-133-812-979; 049-712-872-571-518; 052-744-460-789-363; 053-360-822-867-386; 055-573-521-391-734; 056-485-044-606-873; 057-148-425-810-893; 057-154-527-340-07X; 058-389-738-641-393; 058-569-703-645-405; 059-481-532-517-109; 059-799-569-432-424; 060-370-485-502-185; 062-498-864-901-659; 063-149-938-949-77X; 066-141-735-734-026; 066-557-112-912-585; 067-736-244-342-967; 067-776-594-661-542; 068-905-690-168-04X; 069-067-510-293-836; 069-427-988-216-588; 069-433-310-098-54X; 069-615-800-693-349; 071-907-688-587-285; 072-684-205-430-090; 073-796-412-498-509; 074-299-248-583-208; 075-046-752-556-824; 075-141-607-030-119; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-273-440-946-053; 076-742-312-832-368; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-926-704-396-107; 080-583-403-269-282; 081-036-171-196-873; 083-557-102-376-244; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-787-681-556-687; 085-179-386-712-496; 086-555-672-603-517; 087-535-931-939-575; 087-913-285-269-25X; 088-533-341-382-428; 088-744-024-197-675; 088-993-237-313-315; 090-199-876-094-650; 091-729-566-642-692; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-094-376-421-939; 095-343-352-543-81X; 098-837-269-009-412; 101-127-387-013-017; 103-544-357-330-601; 107-559-043-559-89X; 108-166-013-954-847; 109-204-214-997-350; 110-877-825-891-389; 111-237-962-979-337; 111-533-042-559-328; 112-577-484-081-465; 112-825-637-103-240; 115-745-628-378-305; 117-244-733-356-527; 119-939-838-309-616; 120-610-824-268-907; 122-692-699-174-921; 124-440-274-080-315; 125-030-590-752-368; 128-150-266-973-359; 129-868-939-005-475; 131-900-393-723-959; 132-249-876-847-565; 133-087-716-464-773; 134-535-900-180-116; 136-815-442-429-728; 137-145-415-251-49X; 138-572-926-097-909; 145-897-753-805-768; 147-298-016-601-202; 147-901-808-093-967; 148-460-439-813-652; 155-113-653-541-114; 156-517-876-988-99X; 163-076-040-775-567; 163-637-734-144-951; 164-055-518-540-665; 168-508-476-856-497; 177-438-235-402-633; 177-612-762-897-122; 178-627-938-556-726; 180-678-645-476-580; 182-486-534-854-813; 183-651-336-613-237; 185-327-956-961-556; 186-685-767-846-176; 192-482-672-229-885; 192-564-672-843-315; 196-043-351-689-021,38,true,"CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-ND, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

For example, Sweden and Botswana, two nations vastly different across multiple dimensions, both liberalized their telecom sectors. Why did so many countries adopt liberal reforms in such a short period of time? Conventional wisdom highlights the role of global markets and technology, powerful states, global diffusion, and domestic politics. I argue that contrary to these claims, diffusion through key international organizations is the critical and overlooked factor in explaining rapid global convergence of pro-market telecom reforms. Using an original dataset for 189 countries between 1970 and 2003 and event history analysis, I demonstrate that membership in key liberal trading organizations, especially the WTO and the OECD, increases the likelihood that countries will adopt liberal pro-market reforms in telecommunications. These results speak directly to current public policy debates about the reregulation of global markets and bridges the literatures of policy diffusion, institutional design, and regulatory regimes.",,,,,Public policy; Business; Globalization; Convergence (economics); Pace; Conventional wisdom; International political economy; Corporate governance; Telecommunications; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3508812,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3508812,,,3122188228,,0,,0,false,,

Taylor; Barry L. Tadlock,"This paper further develops the concept of “bottom up” diffusion through an investigation of local-to-state adoption of sexual orientation inclusive nondiscrimination policies. While previous research utilizes the state as the unit of analysis, we focus on the policy learning of state-level decision makers. Our primary research hypothesis is that if local laws influence state policy adoption, state legislators in districts containing municipalities with such ordinances will be more likely to sponsor bills banning employment discrimination against lesbians and gays. State senators appear to learn from the existence of local ordinances banning discrimination against gays and lesbians, as demonstrated by bill sponsorship rates. This paper argues that state legislators receive vital policy and electoral information from the presence of laws within their jurisdiction, and that gay rights groups serve a key role as they can point to policy success at the local level.",,,,,Top-down and bottom-up design; Political science; Law; State (polity); Jurisdiction; Primary research; Sexual orientation; Policy learning; Employment discrimination; Public administration; Unit of analysis,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1657265 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1666241_code1523311.pdf?abstractid=1657265&mirid=1,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1657265,,,2274126070,,0,001-481-906-279-295; 001-829-174-609-168; 002-154-007-150-162; 018-614-532-733-847; 018-769-346-177-716; 025-217-389-617-10X; 036-961-749-635-681; 048-032-418-389-462; 050-082-471-457-812; 051-094-247-597-858; 072-826-532-600-502; 076-240-693-922-091; 083-128-427-871-272; 096-362-816-439-456; 096-591-558-692-908; 096-806-692-731-969; 096-817-111-334-636; 100-436-172-024-424; 101-127-387-013-017; 106-352-974-752-749; 119-471-120-150-123; 121-267-862-967-195; 123-158-324-482-940; 140-882-984-483-643; 180-187-712-085-074,0,false,,

I address this gap by conceptualizing policy transfer and policy diffusion using the multiple streams framework (MSF) and developing hypotheses to connect them. I apply this theorization to explain the limited spread of the energy conservation building code (ECBC) in India by combining a process trace of policy adoption in the embedded case of Andhra Pradesh with a dyadic event history analysis of state-level diffusion during 2012-18. The data for this study are collated from official statistics, elite interviews, news reports, policy documents, and secondary literature. The qualitative analysis shows that policy transfer to Andhra Pradesh occurred when external influence and prior adoption elsewhere were used by a policy entrepreneur to exploit a window of opportunity and couple problem, policy, and politics in the state; the dyadic analysis demonstrates that policy diffusion was influenced by the interaction among the structural characteristics of the problem, policy, and politics streams. I conclude with the implications for research on policy diffusion and the MSF as well as the relevance of the findings for promoting policy innovation for a sustainable energy transition.",50,3,641,669,Business; Regional science; Exploit; Official statistics; Policy transfer; Building code; Window of opportunity; Climate change mitigation; Energy conservation; Sustainability,,,,,https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/policy-diffusion-through-multiple-streams-the-non-adoption-of-ene https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psj.12415 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/psj.12415 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atudelft.nl%3Auuid%3A6c7e99c6-6688-4fbf-bd58-b73895cd04e2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/psj.12415,,10.1111/psj.12415,3118653902,,0,001-232-305-733-360; 001-367-136-082-787; 001-376-956-458-377; 003-542-105-072-533; 003-592-471-884-916; 003-989-414-156-774; 005-699-074-946-151; 006-086-400-376-508; 009-866-360-234-172; 010-719-194-128-280; 012-883-251-761-670; 013-731-270-122-755; 015-175-559-805-942; 016-157-464-269-97X; 017-928-849-887-225; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-690-424-086-612; 022-524-853-570-511; 023-672-511-213-267; 025-112-618-417-304; 025-193-488-999-63X; 025-629-151-179-884; 026-412-549-797-331; 026-721-023-815-290; 027-716-231-274-783; 028-044-978-502-622; 030-716-612-544-343; 031-365-168-451-646; 032-164-929-841-901; 032-925-886-572-222; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-731-186-189-63X; 036-613-300-347-910; 037-649-150-952-373; 039-020-254-249-919; 039-224-663-334-449; 039-318-000-420-191; 043-547-850-265-638; 044-045-984-053-178; 046-247-270-889-916; 047-929-383-206-450; 047-963-511-113-718; 048-221-626-453-871; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-274-654-059-514; 051-563-283-713-00X; 055-585-109-110-812; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-850-774-734-000; 060-419-301-931-423; 061-793-046-506-062; 063-040-467-994-945; 064-463-299-403-755; 065-296-005-360-202; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-214-151-642-627; 068-873-109-492-468; 072-246-212-809-488; 074-821-794-062-855; 075-840-494-022-130; 077-413-548-207-63X; 077-495-223-631-426; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 080-225-005-806-61X; 081-401-115-687-830; 081-652-697-451-014; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-787-681-556-687; 088-890-720-276-399; 089-969-827-582-239; 097-619-405-643-951; 099-158-678-362-972; 100-498-938-256-573; 102-365-038-832-014; 106-352-974-752-749; 110-433-634-413-23X; 112-333-966-495-520; 114-297-985-479-03X; 115-173-048-846-52X; 115-482-499-323-938; 115-667-337-333-237; 115-945-516-849-463; 117-005-511-150-947; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 122-218-292-368-830; 124-017-866-056-345; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-693-072-221-894; 128-412-145-076-659; 128-702-203-484-761; 129-225-996-423-818; 129-470-958-403-882; 139-186-190-548-754; 148-028-139-083-907; 149-601-821-920-013; 154-072-648-876-425; 154-606-437-811-924; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-651-717-186-19X; 175-035-141-942-197; 175-305-486-005-948; 178-883-041-977-406,7,true,cc-by,hybrid

However, there is a comparative lack of empirical literature exploring why states adopt different types of tax incentives. This article draws on the literatures on tax competition and policy diffusion to develop hypotheses about what factors motivate states to adopt business tax incentives, paying particular attention to the influence of other adopting states. It uses event history analysis methods to test hypotheses regarding the adoption of four state tax incentive policies: investment tax credits, apportionment formula changes, research and development tax credits, and job creation tax credits. Regression results show that factors that influence adoption decisions are largely inconsistent across the four incentive types. However, analyses of duration dependence find evidence consistent with the idea that states are “racing to the bottom.”",45,3,1091142115611741,363,Public economics; Value-added tax; Indirect tax; Economics; Microeconomics; Tax competition; Tax incentive; Tax avoidance; Tax reform; Ad valorem tax; State income tax,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/pubfin/v45y2017i3p334-363.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:sae:pubfin:v:45:y:2017:i:3:p:334-363 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1091142115611741 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1091142115611741,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1091142115611741,,10.1177/1091142115611741,2416047817,,0,001-481-906-279-295; 004-687-267-237-736; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-692-270-875-15X; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-446-657-280-351; 019-555-885-904-049; 021-374-675-491-142; 021-907-061-236-840; 022-960-644-725-717; 023-236-082-357-690; 023-843-404-656-218; 033-085-475-899-252; 037-071-534-198-500; 046-296-885-739-931; 058-071-798-060-611; 063-504-944-027-038; 070-439-295-045-214; 070-908-874-142-691; 075-046-752-556-824; 084-035-180-533-354; 085-357-895-356-708; 094-837-040-050-470; 096-362-816-439-456; 098-797-818-793-198; 101-488-954-100-242; 101-606-324-112-868; 113-852-337-995-101; 117-544-939-508-615; 128-109-601-518-819; 131-900-393-723-959; 154-314-204-508-516; 174-768-369-809-642; 178-161-154-094-357; 183-847-505-313-097,15,false,,
054-093-185-680-932,Flatliners: Ideology and rational learning in the adoption of the flat tax,,2009,journal article,European Journal of Political Research,03044130; 14756765,Wiley,United Kingdom,Alexander Baturo; Julia Gray,"What factors explain the wave of adoption of the flat tax in Eastern Europe? It is argued in this article that, once the first few successes were underway, governments with liberal outlooks toward taxation adopted the reform through a process of rational learning: an often radically new government will tend to adopt the policy based on successful implementation of its neighbours. The issue of policy diffusion is approached by explicitly modeling the different mechanisms that might underlie the process. Little evidence is found for pure ‘bandwagoning’ in the adoption of the flat tax – the presence of other market-minded reforms do not predict adoption of the flat tax, and contagion measures do not capture the dynamics of the adoption of the reform. Instead, rational learning, where economically right-wing governments evaluated the success of the reform (as measured by their ability to attract foreign investment) in the medium term, plays the largest role. Rational emulation in a shorter time period contributes to the probability of adoption as well, as does a change to an economically liberal ideology.",48,1,130,159,Government; Emulation; Ideology; Economics; Bandwagoning; Flat tax; Medium term; Foreign direct investment; Market economy,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3967655 http://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00830.x https://www.tcd.ie/iiis/documents/discussion/pdfs/iiisdp210.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00830.x https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00830.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00830.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00830.x,,10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00830.x,3125348963,,0,001-983-308-719-115; 003-193-896-799-954; 004-297-113-020-696; 005-563-638-423-864; 007-940-658-145-674; 008-435-384-778-034; 010-278-292-671-040; 010-297-483-353-575; 013-535-160-555-332; 014-420-171-880-92X; 016-111-382-000-690; 018-590-967-575-135; 020-699-204-941-214; 025-031-790-564-969; 025-193-488-999-63X; 027-532-435-556-495; 028-436-920-125-775; 029-186-959-850-541; 031-048-174-556-138; 031-467-977-653-894; 031-501-671-180-285; 032-474-277-034-664; 032-922-531-685-371; 033-650-959-692-425; 034-061-891-469-550; 035-178-641-236-522; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-961-749-635-681; 041-575-325-535-754; 045-434-937-328-293; 046-585-409-612-893; 047-126-555-802-453; 048-084-385-775-90X; 049-858-364-864-017; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-671-315-820-339; 051-138-259-192-307; 054-733-684-806-619; 054-757-980-896-379; 058-418-465-913-030; 060-533-228-746-414; 061-291-925-111-876; 061-904-727-066-671; 061-973-970-085-871; 063-400-296-712-427; 063-687-121-348-599; 068-434-296-646-05X; 069-234-677-914-88X; 072-991-177-996-846; 073-258-185-033-884; 075-089-695-295-014; 075-098-926-871-766; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-245-139-784-452; 077-588-784-518-266; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-394-009-036-095; 079-979-633-427-51X; 084-910-340-397-172; 093-190-746-631-057; 093-517-693-559-267; 094-804-396-935-471; 101-127-387-013-017; 111-728-885-213-480; 112-251-884-513-781; 114-000-520-149-137; 117-497-428-542-089; 118-093-574-226-127; 128-150-266-973-359; 128-192-528-839-957; 128-371-952-108-161; 129-178-427-274-411; 131-076-765-815-326; 131-147-222-137-720; 131-900-393-723-959; 132-979-312-793-260; 134-892-344-394-257; 139-186-190-548-754; 144-411-393-634-467; 144-538-682-774-907; 148-926-758-581-758; 152-236-364-100-452; 155-286-151-930-641; 164-975-932-326-519; 167-066-617-081-559; 167-143-017-751-172; 168-170-237-294-911; 172-179-125-922-384; 175-166-660-884-697; 177-608-532-303-470; 180-303-061-577-942; 182-986-164-210-594; 184-679-427-908-250; 188-007-362-092-361; 194-767-367-715-475; 196-124-202-913-506,33,false,,

An Analysis of the Restrictions on Economic and Social Activities in The Fight Against COVID-19 in the Brazilian Federal District,2021-03-31,2021,,,,,,Dermeval da Silva Júnior; Suely Mara Vaz Guimarães de Araújo,"By 2020, the world was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that caused hundreds of deaths, in almost all countries. In times of a global health crisis, it is urgent to study, in the field of political science, the policies for coping with the pandemic formulated and implemented by national and subnational governments. This research aims to analyze and stimulate the debate on the measures to restrict economic and social activities triggered by the Government of the Brazilian Federal District in the fight against COVID-19 between February 28th and August 5th, 2020. The evaluation is that there was a misalignment between the evolution of the indicators of cases and deaths in the Brazilian capital and the dynamics of imposing and easing restriction measures over time. This dissociation is analyzed in the light of literature on policy diffusion. Thus, the first measures to restrict activities in the Brazilian Federal District were  premature due to emulation of policies that were already adopted around the world at the time.",72,01,9,40,Public policy; Government; Political science; restrict; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Global health; Economic growth; Coping (psychology); Pandemic; Capital (economics),,,,,https://repositorio.enap.gov.br/handle/1/6269 https://revista.enap.gov.br/index.php/RSP/article/view/4988,https://repositorio.enap.gov.br/handle/1/6269,,,3145849423,,0,005-249-461-623-469; 053-792-869-236-02X; 069-067-510-293-836; 078-572-338-742-129; 085-301-057-452-781; 085-633-584-867-47X; 155-175-516-604-717; 156-586-921-097-184; 162-793-731-688-476; 163-637-734-144-951,0,false,,

Gómez,"Background This article conducts a comparative national and subnational government analysis of the political, economic, and ideational constructivist contextual factors facilitating the adoption of obesity and diabetes policy. Methods We adopt a nested analytical approach to policy analysis, which combines cross-national statistical analysis with subnational case study comparisons to examine theoretical prepositions and discover alternative contextual factors; this was combined with an ideational constructivist approach to policy-making. Results Contrary to the existing literature, we found that with the exception of cross-national statistical differences in access to healthcare infrastructural resources, the growing burden of obesity and diabetes, rising healthcare costs and increased citizens’ knowledge had no predictive affect on the adoption of obesity and diabetes policy. We then turned to a subnational comparative analysis of the states of Mississippi in the United States and Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil to further assess the importance of infrastructural resources, at two units of analysis: the state governments versus rural municipal governments. Qualitative evidence suggests that differences in subnational healthcare infrastructural resources were insufficient for explaining policy reform processes, highlighting instead other potentially important factors, such as state-civil societal relationships and policy diffusion in Mississippi, federal policy intervention in Rio Grande do Norte, and politicians’ social construction of obesity and the resulting differences in policy roles assigned to the central government. Conclusion We conclude by underscoring the complexity of subnational policy responses to obesity and diabetes, the importance of combining resource and constructivist analysis for better understanding the context of policy reform, while underscoring the potential lessons that the United States can learn from Brazil.",6,11,639,648,Policy analysis; Health care; Political science; Constructivist teaching methods; Context (language use); Economic growth; Unit of analysis; Central government; Intervention (law); Politics,Diabetes; Obesity; Policy-making; Subnational Government,Brazil; Case-Control Studies; Delivery of Health Care/organization & administration; Diabetes Mellitus/prevention & control; Health Policy; Humans; Local Government; Obesity/prevention & control; Policy Making; State Government; United States,,,https://www.ijhpm.com/?_action=articleInfo&article=3331&lang https://www.ijhpm.com/article_3331_237d502be75ad6bf459896c5534b9f1d.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/132760949 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29179290/ https://doaj.org/article/1efd549c83334fd9abc609ca6624a661 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5675582 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29179290 https://core.ac.uk/download/110293202.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.15171/ijhpm.2017.13,29179290,10.15171/ijhpm.2017.13,2736619474,PMC5675582,0,008-607-927-437-956; 021-862-227-557-120; 029-345-664-586-275; 038-904-257-722-051; 043-374-269-230-041; 045-611-978-163-987; 047-554-403-608-476; 065-873-552-975-334; 069-513-026-223-817; 073-996-961-065-091; 076-951-181-101-274; 082-820-154-797-947; 115-153-619-379-059; 123-890-976-711-144,2,true,cc-by,gold

It especially focuses on the EU–African Union (AU) relationship. It evaluates this relationship using a typology based on the policy diffusion literature and challenges the notion that the AU is a model of the EU. It addresses the institutionalisation of Africa’s own regional integration process in the context of the EU’s broader external relations practice, which prioritises support for local processes. Rather than a model, the article argues that the EU is best placed to serve as mentor to the AU as the latter seeks to foster regional integration in Africa. By mentoring, the EU is able to fulfil its overarching external relations commitments to local ownership, and realise deepened further integration in Africa.",35,7,785,800,Political economy; Institutionalisation; Political science; Regional integration; Development economics; Regionalism (international relations); Typology,,,,,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/38130/ https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5432627 https://core.ac.uk/display/18327822 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/58018/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07036337.2012.744754,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07036337.2012.744754,,10.1080/07036337.2012.744754,2033193362,,0,004-764-254-509-33X; 005-478-201-401-99X; 006-115-651-956-478; 012-237-600-939-865; 012-329-182-907-577; 014-074-130-766-865; 016-599-868-024-678; 027-738-023-581-962; 027-827-119-143-849; 033-852-662-613-736; 048-084-385-775-90X; 049-260-515-569-765; 049-793-821-810-002; 071-423-484-424-926; 071-629-685-715-598; 075-319-587-351-091; 077-396-775-587-466; 077-945-151-328-246; 086-638-348-584-549; 089-794-684-732-25X; 092-324-017-176-888; 100-194-580-166-596; 103-970-014-944-136; 110-617-811-402-07X; 113-321-950-336-89X; 113-741-307-551-153; 115-482-499-323-938; 130-709-785-245-608; 141-558-789-570-831; 142-750-906-017-020; 153-958-004-179-938; 164-233-293-407-095; 181-553-308-970-809; 185-467-687-873-80X,44,false,,

Koelble,"Abstract This article illustrates how the international financial markets influence socio-economic policy decisions taken by emerging market economies. These markets determine the value of an emerging market economy's currency and have brought about increasing currency volatility. In order to bring some form of regulation to these markets to reduce volatility, an international coalition is essential as these are global markets operating on a global scale. This article suggests that a coalition of emerging market economies may not be sufficient to bring about such regulation as some of these economies (particularly India and China) are beneficiaries of the new financial regime. If countries such as Brazil and South Africa are seeking an international coalition for regulation, then the social democratic movements of Western Europe may be more appropriate coalition partners than the regimes of India and China.",33,1,17,29,Economic policy; Emerging markets; Currency; Economics; International economics; China; Financial market; Emerging market economies; Social democracy; Policy decision; Market economy; Volatility (finance),,,,,https://www.africabib.org/rec.php?RID=303669594 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02589340600618016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02589340600618016,,10.1080/02589340600618016,2034157605,,0,000-732-674-591-77X; 002-937-021-659-839; 004-658-565-245-731; 013-103-160-129-975; 013-197-173-955-58X; 026-281-759-208-016; 037-855-374-870-323; 041-838-453-396-500; 059-651-917-503-508; 060-959-190-521-014; 077-926-704-396-107; 084-246-572-014-852; 084-542-933-019-162; 088-054-212-079-969; 089-180-745-572-936; 102-363-791-778-397; 116-204-014-215-880; 141-424-611-018-456; 165-830-094-983-34X; 182-916-005-647-445; 187-154-798-224-162,2,false,,

There has been an extensive discussion of causes and effects of policy diffusion for democracies, but the literature on autocracies lacks similar focus and scope. Similarly, research on the patterns and causes of policies’ diffusion across regime types is virtually non-existent. After some theoretical considerations about regime effects on diffusion in the first part of this paper, we analyse data on foreign trade regulations and nuclear power plants and compare results across regime types. Based on cross-time cross-section regression models, we can show that, depending on the specific policy field, regime type is of less importance for diffusion processes than theoretically expected. This highlights a need for further detailed research on the general role of regime type regarding policy diffusion.",7,4,541,547,Diffusion (business); Macroeconomics; Autocracy; Economics; Scope (project management); Nuclear power; Democracy; Authoritarianism; Nuclear energy policy,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12373/abstract http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12373/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1758-5899.12373 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/glopol/v7y2016i4p541-547.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12373,,10.1111/1758-5899.12373,2556302293,,0,001-367-136-082-787; 005-249-461-623-469; 008-192-322-656-046; 016-777-561-999-525; 019-454-920-846-524; 036-902-376-999-991; 049-580-250-301-271; 073-796-412-498-509; 077-945-151-328-246; 083-438-585-726-912; 083-964-793-869-264; 086-220-243-754-603; 108-835-553-268-27X; 118-513-543-976-791; 127-539-841-332-937; 129-788-157-455-383; 145-018-319-708-179; 162-415-263-848-564; 196-645-462-460-623,4,false,,

Despite substantial funding behind the initiative, little research has evaluated the implications for language planning, including contextualised implementation challenges. This study aims to investigate how the policy is being enacted into practice at a university in Japan at two different policy levels: the meso (institutional) and micro (classroom) level. The study contrasts one university’s TGUP meso-level policy documentation with data from semi-structured interviews with students and teachers to illuminate micro-level challenges. Data were coded according to emergent themes via qualitative text analysis, following similar processes to research into TGUP policy. The findings suggest that the meso-level policy goals of the university do not trickle down to micro-level practice as envisioned, revealing underlying challenges arising from policy diffusion. In comparing our results with data from other TGUP university studies, we conclude that micro-level linguistic challenges for teachers and students has relevance for other universities where English-taught programmes are being expanded via national and university-level policies.",77,6,1125,1142,Higher education; Relevance (law); Political science; Globalization; Medium of instruction; Language planning; Micro level; Public relations; Documentation; Internationalization,,,,University of Oxford,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1216553 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10734-018-0323-5 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10734-018-0323-5.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10734-018-0323-5,,10.1007/s10734-018-0323-5,2898773094,,0,004-865-520-851-262; 010-938-793-913-563; 016-274-797-717-50X; 025-373-034-088-186; 027-236-339-438-273; 030-357-314-975-418; 040-736-809-498-388; 041-649-498-132-127; 043-230-916-648-776; 050-666-216-410-573; 052-802-625-595-800; 069-629-265-222-875; 070-126-207-443-427; 070-695-702-256-186; 082-266-161-289-849; 091-525-189-563-256; 091-663-932-756-309; 093-132-666-423-869; 094-414-719-793-030; 097-867-300-201-80X; 101-637-723-765-374; 102-987-586-352-843; 103-471-826-197-184; 104-225-149-357-322; 109-275-215-983-768; 110-411-417-580-536; 129-858-347-182-890; 136-411-640-128-677; 139-221-671-806-727; 139-402-276-012-575; 148-597-647-972-671; 157-624-670-698-129; 165-647-578-107-455; 180-135-377-576-858; 180-189-829-202-931,78,true,cc-by,hybrid

Esses esforcos tem sido pautados no interesse pela liberalizacao do comercio, uma vez que consideram as acoes regulatorias domesticas um entrave ao comercio internacional. Ainda que a OMC tenha tido sucesso na remocao de barreiras comerciais de incidencia fronteirica, ela tem se demonstrado menos efetiva na luta contra barreiras nao tarifarias (BNTs), os maiores obstaculos ao comercio atualmente. Dada a atual inabilidade da OMC para lidar adequadamente com essas questoes, alguns paises parecem dispostos a superar a forma tradicional de elaboracao de tratados e explorar novos modos de cooperacao. O crescente fenomeno da “cooperacao regulatoria horizontal”, isto e, cooperacao para questoes transversais, tais como analise de risco, avaliacao de impacto e analise custo-beneficio, parece oferecer uma arena promissora para a superacao das divergencias regulatorias. Tal fenomeno sustenta-se na premissa de que uma convergencia regulatoria significativa pode ser alcancada por meio da confluencia na forma pela qual os agentes reguladores lidam com a elaboracao de normas. Em um momento de crescente interesse internacional e de difusao da politica de analise de custo-beneficio, este capitulo avalia se tal analise poderia ser utilizada para estimular a racionalidade na tomada de decisoes regulatorias, para alem das fronteiras do Estado-nacao. Ao faze-lo, lanca mao da experiencia recente de alguns paises industrializados em cooperacao regulatoria internacional e examina em que medida as nacoes desenvolvidas podem estar dispostas e preparadas para participar desse exercicio de cooperacao. Is there a role for cost-benefit analysis beyond the nation-state? Lessons from international regulatory co-operation In recent decades, governments across the world actively cooperated to harmonize and coordinate policies “behind the borders” through a variety of harmonization efforts at multilateral, as well as regional and bilateral, levels. These efforts have been dictated by the trade liberalization agenda, which perceives domestic regulatory action as a factor impeding international trade. While the WTO has been successful in removing barriers to trade at the border, it is proving less effective in the fight against non-tariff barriers (NTBs), today’s most prominent obstacles to trade exchanges. Given the current inability of the WTO to effectively address such concerns, some countries seem willing to go beyond traditional international treaty making and to explore new avenues of cooperation. The emerging phenomenon of “horizontal regulatory cooperation,” i.e., cooperation on crosscutting issues such as risk assessment, impact assessment, and cost-benefit analysis, seems to offer a promising venue for overcoming regulatory divergence. It relies on the assumption that substantive regulatory convergence can be facilitated by convergence of the general way in which regulators approach standard setting. At a time of growing international interest and policy diffusion of cost-benefit analysis, this chapter explores whether cost-benefit analysis could be used to promote rationality in regulatory decisionmaking beyond the nation-state. In so doing, it draws on the recent experience of international regulatory cooperation of some industrialized countries and examines the extent to which developing nations may be willing and able to participate in this cooperation exercise.",270,,13,39,Economy; Geography; International treaty; Welfare economics,,,,,http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/ojs/index.php/rda/article/view/58736/57253,http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/rda.v270.2015.58736,,10.12660/rda.v270.2015.58736,2291392825,,0,,0,true,,gold

Additionally, heterogeneity in these effects is examined across regulatory, morality, and governance policy types. The study not only reveals what we know about policy diffusion after 30 years of quantitative analysis, it identifies several correctable gaps in the literature. The results not only support the efforts to expand diffusion research to large-n analyses, but they also reveal additional benefits of small-n event history studies for the progressive advancement of this important research program.",,,,,Regional science; Ideology; Political science; Morality; Quantitative analysis (finance); Event history; Corporate governance; Federalism; Legislature; Meta-analysis,,,,,https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/api-gateway/apsa/assets/orp/resource/item/5f60d10709737c0019ab4976/original/the-spread-of-policy-diffusion-studies-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-1990-2018.pdf https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/apsa/article-details/5f60d10709737c0019ab4976,http://dx.doi.org/10.33774/apsa-2020-csnt6,,10.33774/apsa-2020-csnt6,3093682608,,0,,3,true,,green

Soft direct democracy refers to non-binding referendum motions and advisory referendums, which the literature on direct democracy has largely ignored. Strategic motives have dominated previous explanations of the occurrence of initiatives and referendums, but are less useful in exploring non-binding procedures of direct democracy. The article distinguishes four types of factors – socio-structural, party system, political support and learning – and tests hypotheses on their effects with sub-national data from Finland. The data enable us to compare two different types of instruments – non-binding referendum motions and advisory referendums – while controlling for many unobserved factors. The findings show that erosion of political support, participatory traditions and policy diffusion explain the occurrence of bottom-up referendum motions, while the last two together with small population and party system factors predict the occurrence of advisory government-initiated referendums.",23,1,50,76,Political science; Citizen journalism; Local government; Referendum; Population; Public administration; Direct democracy; Politics,,,,Turku Urban Research Programme; Foundation for Municipal Development in Finland,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/spsr.12238 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spsr.12238/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/spsr.12238 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spsr.12238/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/spsr.12238,,10.1111/spsr.12238,2582021715,,0,002-784-949-466-159; 005-206-165-450-647; 006-866-691-235-779; 007-531-222-038-168; 007-798-333-287-661; 007-848-709-841-804; 010-391-318-441-222; 015-294-334-611-647; 017-517-491-290-822; 019-198-724-448-473; 023-771-256-909-067; 031-882-679-666-214; 034-852-031-972-982; 037-760-539-612-460; 039-736-479-655-372; 040-543-410-179-456; 043-555-750-667-920; 049-819-422-656-83X; 054-353-487-979-049; 056-450-197-002-958; 056-692-818-445-340; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-628-946-435-944; 058-794-868-653-615; 062-585-141-694-620; 067-776-171-423-956; 071-326-707-882-920; 074-181-817-484-928; 075-604-983-989-874; 075-775-545-562-797; 076-240-693-922-091; 079-264-259-121-852; 081-064-114-658-697; 082-049-201-619-38X; 084-544-475-315-616; 090-105-315-408-269; 094-815-600-117-112; 096-006-741-638-088; 100-440-202-764-231; 101-767-697-640-847; 102-383-799-622-379; 102-477-705-345-145; 105-783-342-687-174; 111-176-720-726-138; 117-659-161-827-024; 121-511-102-366-727; 122-646-447-119-558; 125-796-050-204-562; 126-757-491-197-825; 127-462-990-863-982; 131-026-118-408-817; 133-009-272-034-014; 140-021-820-301-28X; 147-421-890-180-994; 148-443-478-697-450; 154-259-045-093-894; 154-919-173-717-033; 158-035-527-026-355; 159-346-836-194-525; 164-206-825-096-133; 183-882-735-659-732,28,true,,bronze

Exploring the selection of performance indicators in six countries (Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and the US), the article analyses the driving forces for the choice of particular indicators in the context of national administrative traditions and more recent reform agendas on the one hand and the trend towards international exchange and `benchmarking' on the other hand. The article explores the relative significance and interaction of different driving forces of choice and how this shapes the development and application of performance indicators. To that end, it combines instutionalist approaches with the literature on the mechanisms and effects of international exchange and policy diffusion.

This, in turn, is an indication that policies travel. But why are certain policies imitated while others are not? The author seeks to further our understanding of policy diffusion and its dynamics by investigating how foreign ideas are integrated and translated into new contexts, and how these imported ideas influence national policymaking and implementation. The National Drug Policies in Laos and Vietnam are studied in order to identify factors facilitating or restraining policy processes—and to discuss the effects of diffusion. In the 1980s reforms were initiated leading to far-reaching economic liberalisation in Laos and Vietnam. These reforms have affected all segments of society, including the health sector. The pharmaceutical sector was privatised, drugs became widely available, and self-medication as well as fake and sub-standard drugs proliferated. This was the setting when the Lao and Vietnamese governments had to consider the development of a National Drug Policy, as part of the development assistance from Swedish Sida to their health sectors. In 1993 the National Drug Policy was endorsed in Laos, and in 1996 the policy was adopted in Vietnam. Hence, the policy processes were initiated within the framework of bilateral cooperation between donors and the two Ministries of Health. In other words, there had been a spread of external ideas, or policy diffusion. Later on these ideas and NDP had to be translated into, and implemented in, the national context. Thus, the study covers the time from the development of the policies until present the time, 2001. Drawing on research in policy studies, constructivism, new institutionalism, and globalisation, the study aims to bridge the international/national divide in policymaking both theoretically and empirically. In an era of escalating globalisation and ever increasing flows of ideas, the author argues for the contextualisation of policymaking and problematisation of the often taken for granted rational actor approach inherent in much of the policy literature. The main findings indicate that although the formulation of the policies may be relatively trouble-free, it does not automatically mean that the translation of the policy into practice will follow as anticipated. In order to understand why new ideas are accepted and integrated into a new context and how this affects the implementation, one must look at the way new policies have been spread and translated into a new context. This, in turn, can provide insights as to why some policies are more successful than others, and why the policy process in Laos appears to have been more straightforward than in Vietnam.",,123,,,Constructivism (philosophy of education); Policy analysis; Political science; Order (exchange); Policy studies; Globalization; New institutionalism; Context (language use); Public administration; Liberalization,,,,,https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/files/4408232/4770180.pdf https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/1930c3e5-1c2a-4565-9ef9-3f861ef24c71 http://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/4408232/4770180.pdf https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/4408232/4770180.pdf https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/translating-foreign-ideas-into-domestic-practices-pharmaceutical-,https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/1930c3e5-1c2a-4565-9ef9-3f861ef24c71,,,2105879384,,0,,29,false,,

In order to understand the development of cash transfers in Indonesia, it is necessary to examine the long-term policy evolution in the context of national politics. This paper analyses the policy evolution of cash transfers in Indonesia, focusing on the policy decision process at the national level since the Asian economic crisis. It tracks three critical conjunctures of social protection for the poor in which Indonesia tried to adapt cash transfer schemes and institutional frameworks, and eventually consolidated the social protection system. Cash transfers have been adapted in Indonesia in keeping with the strong political motivations of top policymakers for popular support in the context of democratisation, but policy transfers of cash transfers provided an important impetus for the development of social protection system in Indonesia.",,,,,Economic policy; Business; Democratization; Order (exchange); Policy transfer; Social protection; Cash; Cash transfers; Context (language use); Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2781815,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2781815,,,3121356856,,0,,0,false,,

Valente; Stephanie R. Dyal; Kar-Hai Chu; Heather Wipfli; Kayo Fujimoto,"This study applies diffusion of innovations theory to understand network influences on country ratification of an international health treaty, the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC). From 2003 to 2014 approximately 90% of United Nations member countries ratified the FCTC. We hypothesized that communication between tobacco control advocates on GLOBALink, a 7000-member online communication forum in existence from 1992 to 2012, would be associated with the timing of treaty ratification. We further hypothesized dynamic network influences such that external influence decreased over time, internal influence increased over time, and the role of opinion leader countries varied over time. In addition we develop two concepts: Susceptibility and influence that uncover the micro-level dynamics of network influence. Statistical analyses lend support to the influence of co-subscriptions on GLOBALink providing a conduit for inter-country influences on treaty ratification and some support for the dynamic hypotheses. Analyses of susceptibility and infection indicated particularly influential countries. These results have implications for the study of policy diffusion as well as dynamic models of behavior change.",145,,89,97,Opinion leadership; Behavior change; Political science; International economics; Ratification; Treaty; Convention; Tobacco control; Diffusion of innovations; Tobacco industry; Economic growth,Behavior change; Diffusion of innovations; Health; Policy; Social network analysis,"Diffusion of Innovation; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; International Cooperation/legislation & jurisprudence; Models, Statistical; Smoking/legislation & jurisprudence; Smoking Prevention; Social Networking; Tobacco; Tobacco Industry/economics; World Health Organization",,NCI NIH HHS (R01 CA157577) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4630093 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027795361530143X https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:socmed:v:145:y:2015:i:c:p:89-97 https://core.ac.uk/display/82120135 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26460508/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4630093 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v145y2015icp89-97.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361530143X https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82120135.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.001,26460508,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.001,2174265204,PMC4630093,0,003-215-531-527-707; 006-335-929-448-983; 006-722-686-316-360; 013-848-026-013-919; 014-074-130-766-865; 014-812-219-323-990; 014-824-177-505-515; 015-701-444-535-687; 015-734-501-464-709; 016-002-314-063-646; 017-962-097-586-372; 018-460-245-425-359; 022-277-485-388-04X; 027-315-416-647-593; 027-853-530-334-273; 028-369-875-517-536; 031-713-486-024-445; 032-220-205-010-399; 035-917-843-464-255; 036-961-749-635-681; 040-058-016-041-863; 042-397-718-657-397; 043-117-570-987-791; 052-998-446-931-087; 062-905-613-336-435; 067-490-686-317-462; 067-556-730-308-483; 069-246-795-278-536; 069-909-494-409-568; 073-014-201-416-869; 073-877-167-702-071; 074-838-083-219-319; 076-197-419-082-041; 076-240-693-922-091; 079-827-679-277-948; 081-231-253-156-502; 089-111-148-157-604; 092-596-138-051-837; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-247-533-496-608; 111-085-619-662-631; 112-811-375-359-942; 119-848-490-060-771; 133-286-538-823-607; 141-833-159-901-88X; 145-079-289-706-71X; 149-479-005-872-184; 150-325-162-873-23X; 160-419-787-080-707; 163-637-734-144-951; 184-531-448-489-154,26,true,cc-by,hybrid

Phillips,"This limited examination of policy diffusion mechanisms provides some support for learning as a mechanism for diffusing patrol rifles across police agencies. Policy diffusion is generally defined as a government making policy choices based on the policies existing in other governments. A contemporary law enforcement concern for police agencies is the “active-shooter” incident. Many police agencies now have policies that allow their street officers to be armed with patrol rifles, a high-powered, military-style weapon that historically was used only by SWAT officers. This study used a snowball sampling technique to distribute an online survey to 168 officers who in the past had attended the FBI National Academy. Three mechanisms common in policy diffusion were measured: learning, coercion, and imitation. While measures of learning were seen in the diffusion process, the measure of imitation was inconsistent with expectations, and coercion was not found in the data.

We compare these strategies to seeding the ten states the RWJF monitored during the states' implementation of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. We attempt to mimic the choices that policy advocates make when deciding which states to target with their resources. Our results indicate that focusing on innovative states, that is, those that tend to adopt new policies faster, offers a valuable boost in the speed of diffusion.

Shipan; Craig Volden,"Local policy adoptions provide an excellent opportunity to test among potential mechanisms of policy diffusion. By examining three types of antismoking policy choices by the 675 largest U.S. cities between 1975 and 2000, we uncover robust patterns of policy diffusion, yielding three key findings. First, we distinguish among and find evidence for four mechanisms of policy diffusion: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate cities, imitation of larger cities, and coercion by state governments. Second, we find a temporal component to these effects, with imitation being a more short-lived diffusion process than the others. Third, we show that these mechanisms are conditional, with larger cities being better able to learn from others, less fearful of economic spillovers, and less likely to rely on imitation.",52,4,840,857,Public economics; Imitation; Diffusion (business); Economics; Coercion; Economic competition; Local policy,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x/abstract https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/amposc/v52y2008i4p840-857.html https://www.jstor.org/stable/25193853 https://core.ac.uk/display/21643144,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x,,10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x,1986486185,,0,000-192-532-498-436; 001-328-701-270-077; 001-871-757-369-265; 003-910-374-826-467; 006-106-338-978-676; 008-180-005-498-322; 008-781-491-143-52X; 012-547-632-605-329; 012-883-251-761-670; 016-978-298-405-048; 018-769-346-177-716; 019-456-406-334-322; 019-664-267-521-174; 033-085-475-899-252; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-356-098-551-334; 036-961-749-635-681; 043-418-719-602-52X; 046-444-041-342-653; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-671-315-820-339; 050-861-949-203-68X; 054-917-172-837-602; 057-621-004-140-001; 059-431-435-680-507; 061-071-739-936-378; 064-753-387-756-134; 065-296-005-360-202; 067-490-686-317-462; 070-439-295-045-214; 074-591-312-235-434; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 081-840-373-163-25X; 081-963-078-042-359; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-439-721-812-26X; 084-787-681-556-687; 086-155-518-024-549; 086-295-173-349-915; 086-786-776-616-409; 088-919-425-365-248; 090-614-726-968-223; 090-636-221-923-414; 093-190-746-631-057; 093-830-324-609-012; 095-179-619-530-275; 098-317-151-036-205; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 106-352-974-752-749; 121-916-230-399-721; 131-900-393-723-959; 137-674-676-505-121; 142-090-880-007-148; 144-664-608-542-427; 145-463-093-374-983; 155-580-858-393-517; 178-927-906-303-374,839,false,,

To what extent does the political ideology of parties in government and parliament matter? Drawing on immigration policy data offering unprecedented historical and geographical coverage, we analyse the drivers of immigration reforms in 21 Western immigration countries between 1970 and 2012. Our results show that there is no robust effect of the political ideology of governments and parliaments on the overall restrictiveness of immigration reforms. Partisan effects are limited to certain migration policy areas, primarily to integration policies, and to certain migrant groups, particularly asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. In contrast, political party ideology does not fundamentally shape decisions on the core of immigration regimes, such as entry policies or policies towards labour and family migrants. Our findings also showcase the importance of international policy diffusion and of trade-offs between reforms in different policy areas. Overall, the analysis highlights that although immigration is subject to heated debates in the public sphere and extensive political bargaining, the actual policies enacted seem primarily driven by factors such as economic growth, social welfare protection and the structure of political systems that are largely independent of the political ideology of parties in power.",2,1,1735255,,Immigration policy; Political economy; Government; Ideology; Political science; Public sphere; Parliament; Social Welfare; Immigration; Politics,,,,H2020 European Research Council; Seventh Framework Programme,https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A2966251/view https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/55655276/Political_party_ideology_and_immigration_policy_reform_an_empirical_enquiry.pdf https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2474736X.2020.1735255 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2474736X.2020.1735255 https://dare.uva.nl/search?field1=dai;value1=401621855;docsPerPage=1;startDoc=5 https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/138337/ https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2F464fcefb-aa81-44b8-9732-63e8f6fb4646,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2474736x.2020.1735255,,10.1080/2474736x.2020.1735255,3010396351,,0,004-364-028-346-533; 005-217-948-961-834; 005-503-368-143-840; 006-089-326-015-854; 007-956-277-382-621; 009-245-481-391-412; 011-567-993-408-840; 014-139-629-247-874; 015-184-641-682-886; 026-208-998-101-91X; 026-333-637-688-711; 030-197-755-308-418; 035-396-253-896-460; 044-284-969-072-90X; 051-784-293-472-640; 055-090-835-776-77X; 056-707-407-152-868; 057-019-365-378-953; 058-071-798-060-611; 063-419-872-174-904; 066-122-109-723-131; 071-059-323-785-976; 072-538-297-096-177; 078-797-373-768-604; 086-950-675-735-494; 087-870-698-243-093; 087-923-174-851-430; 094-662-511-418-701; 104-881-159-417-144; 105-620-849-895-259; 111-402-260-321-692; 111-810-080-707-38X; 112-705-445-586-560; 112-899-994-763-150; 120-264-300-375-681; 121-286-503-083-674; 124-450-819-898-715; 126-757-491-197-825; 128-498-038-971-025; 128-543-959-012-881; 133-947-204-164-395; 139-153-398-330-745; 152-552-609-759-453; 155-711-023-569-331; 167-627-553-630-869; 176-931-789-909-420; 181-944-344-844-875; 192-223-518-762-159,12,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC",gold

058-598-382-179-927,Local implementation of climate policy in the Netherlands: facing the challenges of mitigation and adaption,,2013,,,,,,M.M. van den Berg; Thomas Hoppe; Franciscus H.J.M. Coenen,"Ever since the Kyoto protocol became effective (1997), national governments have been; delegating climate policies to local governments. In the Netherlands, national climate policy has; been effective since 1999 while targeting at a multi-governmental approach. In 2010, a survey; found that local climate policies have been adopted by the vast majority of local governments; throughout the country. Therefore, obviously, the national government claims that their local climate; policy diffusion programs have been successful. This is, however, not the case. Whereas climate; mitigation strategies have indeed been adopted widely (Hoppe and Coenen, 2011), this cannot be; said for the adoption of adaptation strategies as this varies strongly across the country (Van den; Berg and Coenen, 2012).

This article attempts to fill this gap in diffusion research by examining the adoption and subsequent modification of “Three Strikes and You’re Out” laws in the American states. Its analysis suggests that distinct political forces affected state-level outcomes at these two stages of the policymaking process. The rapid spread of Three Strikes laws in the 1990s seems to have occurred because states with more conservative leanings and higher proportions of African-American residents gravitated to a salient and visible policy. In contrast, the modification of Three Strikes laws appears to have been encouraged by financial necessity and shifting ideological environments but hindered by the mobilization of stakeholders with an interest in preserving the status quo, including private prison operators and prison officer unions.

This study assesses the factors that led more than 45 states to enact and some to later repeal Motion Picture Incentive programs, a collection of tax incentives aimed at facilitating job creation and economic diversification. We find program enactments were driven by rising unemployment and national but not bordering state imitation. Falling unemployment and national trends drove subsequent terminations, but in many states, their impact was overwhelmed by the influence of incentive spending, which greatly reduced termination likelihood. These results not only shed light on policy enactments and terminations in general, but also inform scholarship on state tax incentives and the role of competitive factors in their creation and repeal — or lack thereof.",,,,,Public policy; Labour economics; Economics; Diversification (marketing strategy); State (polity); Scholarship; Unemployment; Repeal; Incentive; Incentive program,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2889524,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2889524,,,3123352459,,0,,0,false,,

IHS Political Science Series No. 131, July 2012",2012-07-01,2012,,,,,,Jeffrey Chwieroth,"Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), government-owned or managed investment vehicles, have proliferated at a remarkable rate over the past decade, even as political controversy has surrounded them. Why? The extant literature depicts the process of SWF creation as driven by functional imperatives associated with “excess” revenue and reserves accumulated from commodity booms and large current account surpluses. I argue that SWF creation also reflects in large part a process of contingent emulation in which first this policy has been constructed as appropriate for countries with given characteristics, and then when countries took on these characteristics, they followed their peers. Put simply, fashions and fads in finance matter for policy diffusion. I assess this argument using a new dataset on SWF creation that covers nearly 80 countries from 1984 to 2007. The results suggest peer-based contingent emulation has been a crucial factor shaping the decision of many countries to create a SWF, especially among fuel exporters.; An earlier version of this paper was presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Washington, DC, 2 – 5 September 2010.

Wilkerson,"Abstract Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful measures to flatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy diffusion explain the timing of governors’ decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of five social distancing policies across all fifty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies. These delays are likely to produce significant, on-going harm to public health.",,,,,Public health; Political economy; Government; Social distance; Political science; Mandate; State (polity); Harm; Pandemic; Politics,,,,,http://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20046326v1 https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/03/31/2020.03.30.20046326.full.pdf https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20046326v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20046326,,10.1101/2020.03.30.20046326,3013045750,,0,003-948-818-969-164; 004-826-345-185-511; 009-589-456-653-168; 019-510-449-345-018; 026-459-054-115-798; 034-228-291-956-162; 043-906-848-966-955; 047-015-765-885-224; 055-725-947-911-610; 058-908-580-827-56X; 059-398-195-656-230; 065-335-742-829-209; 069-280-491-758-249; 074-390-173-246-174; 075-845-954-789-918; 077-072-371-251-295; 095-365-529-820-892; 102-872-777-076-191; 141-196-894-269-092; 145-463-093-374-983; 148-223-435-969-407; 153-291-209-126-925; 160-534-835-534-616; 168-285-976-792-121; 176-503-345-697-964,61,true,cc-by-nc-nd,green

This study examines an underresearched case of nonenfranchisement and engages with debates on external voting, diaspora politics, and citizenship beyond borders. Building on qualitative and participatory methods, the analysis unveils the obstacles to franchise reform despite significant progress from 2004 to 2019. Although external voting was not enacted legally, emigrants’ voting rights were debated, formally acknowledged, and encouraged. It is not the lack of norm entrepreneurs but the cumulative effect of indecisive actions that perpetuates a counterproductive dynamic and de facto uneven access to this right. An unresolved debate simultaneously advances conversations but precludes compromises, turning resolution deferral into an implicit form of regulating emigrants’ political inclusion or exclusion. Presenting original evidence, this study expands existing accounts, highlights the interaction between institutional and social drivers of change, and invites further research on the role of policy diffusion, domestic politics, and timing.",,,1,27,Deferral; Voting; Politics; Political economy; Citizenship; Emigration; Citizen journalism; Political science; Diaspora; Incentive; Economics; Sociology; Development economics; Law; Market economy; Accounting,,,,,,,,,,,0,,0,true,,hybrid

Though these regulations were first largely inspired by the European Union policy models, each country gradually developed more autonomy, individually tailoring their regulatory frameworks overtime. The case of Universal Service Obligation (USO) policies show that while Jordan remained aligned with the European Union, Moroccan policy-makers diverged from the European Union by adopting alternative policies, inspired by the Latin American reverse-auction models. Research focusing on Euro-Mediterranean egulatory contexts commonly expect neighbouring countries to converge with EU regulatory models. Yet, borrowing on policy diffusion literature and specifically the mechanisms of learning and imitation, this article shows that policy-takers intentionally decided on the (non)adoption of USO policies.

Theoretical perspectives of political market and policy diffusion and innovation provide conceptual framework to reconfigure policy typology of innovation related to sustainability. As using logistics and multinomial logistic regression analysis with 1212 observations of local governments, this paper confirms that local policy orientation related to environment and social equity is more likely to adopt policy innovation for local sustainability, while policy orientation of economic development is not likely to adopt. Moreover, administrative manager is to promote the local sustainability through policy innovation in order to achieve both of long-term growth of local community and professional or administrative career.",21,1,69,86,Public economics; Conceptual framework; Business; Order (exchange); Social equality; Local community; Field (Bourdieu); Sustainability; Typology; Politics,,,,,http://dspace.kci.go.kr/handle/kci/1242283 https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002469077 https://www.earticle.net/Article/A365109,http://dx.doi.org/10.38134/klgr.2019.21.1.069,,10.38134/klgr.2019.21.1.069,2986214843,,0,,0,false,,

061-418-795-057-239,Regional Reference Groups in the Spreading of Occupational Licensing Policies among the States: An Exploratory Study,,1982,journal article,Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare,01915096,,,Timothy W. Lause,"This study explores the diffusion of state licensing policies, particularly the role of regional cuetaking in the adoption of new policies. Five such networks are suggested, along with the states most likely to serve as models for those reference groups. Findings have several implications for social work lobbying efforts. Social workers have participated in state policy debates throughout professional history. However, the organization for coordinated involvement is quite new. It emerged in the mid-seventies with an expanding record of legislative action by the state chapters of the National Association of Social Workers (Lause, 1979). These associations enable the profession to pursue various social reforms at the state level and that capacity is most timely in its development. The nineteen eighties have begun with an empowerment of designs for social welfare which seem archaic and hostile to an extent unprecedented in modern history. Certainly, the first ""state of the union"" address of the Reagan administration calls for significant shifts in the roles of federal and state governments in the amelioration and solution of many social problems. In form and content, the ""reforms"" of the first part of this decade pose strong challenges to social work action in the fifty statehouses as well as in the national congress. Given the historic stability of our federal system, however, the statehouses will continue to be major arenas for policy development even when a national administration asserts again a progressive agenda for social welfare. This study of regional diffusion in the spreading of policy innovations is designed to suggest ways that social work might improve its effectiveness in legislative action in both the worst and best of times. Moreover, it illustrates the need to develop an understanding of policymaking in the states which is at least partially distinguishable from the bases of knowledge used for professional action in local or national arenas. Several models of policy innovation are well suited to decisionmaking in the states. First, the diffusion model holds that change results typically from the borrowing of ideas rather than from independent invention and that those patterns of exchange are patterned, not random (Rogers, 1962). Second, the organizational model directs attention to legislative norms or informal rules which guide state deliberations and decisions (Lindblom, 1959; Wildavsky, 1974). Third, the regional model looks to underlying similarities in state economics, culture, and political organization as explanations for their policy decisions (Sharkansky, 1968, 1970; Garreau, 1981). These three models combine to suggest scenarios for the adoption of reforms by individual states and for the overall spreading of policy innovations among them. The cornerstone of the scenario for individual states is a tendency of officials to view the policy innovations of nearby states as potential guides or models for their own decisions (Walker, 1973: 1187). In contrast, distant states are likely to be discounted as appropriate models if they are seen as operating under different cultural, political, or economic circumstances. The perceptions of shared histories and current conditions may be expressed as legislative norms which lie somewhat bidden in established patterns of consultation and cuetaking between states. For example, officials in Louisiana may look to Texas or Arkansas as potential models but not even consider seriously Michigan or California in such a role. From a nationwide perspective, the same models suggest another related scenario for the overall spreading of new policies among the states. First, a relatively few may gain nationwide reputations as pioneers or originators of bold reforms. However, that same reputation may make them too different from most states to serve widely as direct models in cuetaking. Instead, regional models and reference groups seem to structure cuetaking for most states (Walker, 1969: 892). In brief, innovation tends to begin with adoptions by one or more national pioneers, followed by enactments in other states which then serve as regional models for the remaining states. State policy diffusion research, therefore, has two types of applications in social work's approach to legislative action. The first involves action in individual states, based upon knowledge of which neighbors tend to be viewed as comparable and reasonable guides for policy innovation. The second application involves strategies for promoting rapid nationwide adoptions of preferred policies. In this case, both national pioneers and regional models would be targeted as priorities in lobbying efforts. While knowledge of reference patterns between states in no way ensures success in these efforts, it would serve as a definite aid in overcoming inertia and uncertainty about policy reform in the states. Evidence of Cuetaking Between States State officials have taken note of policy developments in other states since the first days of constitutional ratification. Today, a great variety of special organizations promote exchanges of information about new policies. They include organizations of state officials, such as the National Legislative Conference which encourages cuetaking through written reports, regional meetings, and national assemblies (Ross and Millsap, 1966: 40). In addition, the state funded Council of State Governments serves as an interstate clearinghouse on the performance of policy innovations. The regional offices of many federal departments are also active in the dissemination of information among state agencies which, in turn, may model their legislative proposals on policies adopted by other states. Finally, special interest groups may promote cuetaking between states in subtle ways. Their lobbying may be intensified as policy decisions in other states demonstrate the feasibility of success in their own efforts, particularly when those models are neighboring states. All the above organizations provide the states with ample opportunity for taking cues from each other in the adoption of new policies. A number of studies provide direct evidence of interstate cuetaking. Over 90 percent of the heads of 67 state agencies in four southern states reported that they had consulted with counterparts in other states for ideas on how policy issues might be approached in their own state (Sharkansky, 1968: 103). Three quarters of these contacts involved southern states. Nationwide surveys add documentation of the practice of cuetaking (Light, 1978; Wright and Peddicord, 1974). Officials view other states as more useful sources of new ideas than the federal government, even when their agency depends heavily on federal funds (Light, 1978: 151-152). Case studies in Missouri (Masters and Salisbury, 1964) and in Illinois (Anton, 1966) also found cuetaking between states in the deliberations of legislative bodies. However, they seemed to view only certain other states as reasonable comparisons and useful models for their own decisions. Evidence of regional cuetaking is not limited to surveys and field studies. Walker (1969: 894) concludes that a number of regional networks influence the spreading of policy innovations, based on a Q factor analysis of relations between states in the timing of their policy enactments. He suggested that such networks operate in the south, mountain-northwest, Great Lakes, Middle Atlantic, border, and New England areas (Walker, 1969: 884). New York, Massachusetts, California, and New Jersey are identified as likely national pioneers in the adoption of new policies (Walker, 1969: 884). Unlike the other nationwide studies, Walker (1969) proposes boundaries for the various regional networks of states. This study shares that objective and it adopts the same methodology. However, its focus is limited to diffusion within one field of state policy rather than diffusion patterns which might apply to all fields of innovation. General vs. Selective Diffusion Networks There is some indication that state officials may adjust their regional orientations when proposed innovations involve different fields of policy. New ideas are usually borrowed from others when conditions related to a change are similar. What happens when the strength of similarities which underlie a particular regional orientation vary as different types of similarities are being considered? Missouri officials, for example, might identify with their southern and western neighbors for cuetaking in the field of education because of similarities in tax bases and public opinion. In terms of cuetaking in the field of energy or natural resources, however, these similarities are less relevant than they are for education innovations. Indeed, differences in climate, fuel reserves, and economic organization may lead Missouri officials to discount their southern and western neighbors as reasonable models for their own energy policies. Those types of characteristics might prompt a northern or eastern orientation in energy related policies. This variable or dynamic view of regionalism is supported by Sharkansky's (1970) analysis. He found that different variants of regional boundaries are most useful for predicting different sets of social, political, economic, and state policy variables (Sharkansky, 1970: 33-37). This study focuses on a single field in order to avoid the problematic assumption that regionalism is a mono-",9,1,7,,Energy policy; Agency (sociology); Political economy; Government; Political science; State (polity); Ratification; Public relations; Federalism; Social Welfare; Legislature,,,,,https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/jssw/vol9/iss1/7/ https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1512&context=jssw,https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/jssw/vol9/iss1/7/,,,336415996,,0,014-018-662-807-908; 021-708-324-335-858; 031-762-133-647-285; 036-961-749-635-681; 041-013-937-844-756; 042-049-501-700-445; 052-252-031-072-654; 054-235-250-768-895; 075-001-894-805-081; 092-062-123-583-244; 131-674-359-745-844; 158-955-357-380-133; 163-637-734-144-951; 193-154-027-591-826,0,false,,

The passage of these laws is influenced by both domestic and international factors. This article reviews the main international factors, drawing on a powerful new dataset of climate legislation in 66 national jurisdictions. We find that the propensity to legislate on climate change is heavily influenced by the passage of similar laws elsewhere, suggesting a strong and so far under-appreciated role for international policy diffusion. International treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol work in two ways. The impact of the Kyoto Protocol itself is limited to countries with formal obligations under the treaty. In addition, the prestige of hosting an international climate summit is associated with a subsequent boost in legislation.

Recent research suggests, however, that learning is more than simply observing policy adoption in other jurisdictions and must also include an assessment of the outcomes or effectiveness of those policies. This article argues that an assessment of the ability to implement an innovation is also likely to be a component of the learning process. Specifically, it argues that potential adopters are likely to ask not only, “Was the policy effective in other states that adopted it?” but also, “Can we make the policy work for us?” We test hypotheses drawn from this general argument in a directed dyad analysis of renewable portfolio standards in the American states between 1997 and 2009. Results indicate that shared implementation environments among jurisdictions help determine the impact that information about policy effectiveness has on adoption decisions.

It finds that the 2008 constitutional reform at the federal level exerts a strong positive effect (federal mandate); being situated in a neighborhood of states that have reformed has a counterintuitive negative effect (spatial proximity); and having a governor from the same party as governors of other states that have reformed has a positive influence (network affinity).

However, one influence has largely been neglected so far: states’ spatial dependency. Is it possible to observe diffusion to the extent that states’ interlinkages allow their compliance with the acquis communautaire to be assessed? Are candidate states more – or perhaps even less – likely to comply with EU law when other candidates do? The paper seeks to address these questions. By building on existing research on policy diffusion, it develops a theoretical framework for studying candidates’ compliance with EU law over the accession process according to their spatial dependence. The theoretical argument focuses on ‘competitive learning’ and is tested with quantitative data. The results suggest that candidates’ levels of compliance are indeed driven by spatial interlinkages; however, free riding seems more prevalent than enhanced compliance.",38,3,601,626,Political science; International economics; Accession; Conditionality; Compliance (psychology); Spatial Dependency; Argument; Public relations; Race (biology); Free riding,,,,,http://repository.essex.ac.uk/14031/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2014.943523 https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/248223/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2014.943523,,10.1080/01402382.2014.943523,2060068124,,0,001-300-907-145-103; 002-090-110-364-521; 002-922-110-324-465; 003-158-031-081-923; 003-193-896-799-954; 003-412-189-797-295; 003-628-352-044-22X; 004-336-147-101-733; 004-642-261-134-761; 005-196-930-250-954; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-722-686-316-360; 007-407-689-788-669; 007-958-358-931-812; 010-278-292-671-040; 010-947-899-562-815; 011-280-791-239-008; 012-237-600-939-865; 014-145-446-402-502; 015-312-925-365-683; 016-902-908-831-917; 017-554-589-577-795; 017-643-852-312-730; 019-387-957-666-204; 021-221-433-634-713; 022-439-947-732-749; 023-232-614-979-565; 023-672-511-213-267; 024-485-021-749-432; 025-101-723-137-407; 026-258-944-811-866; 027-738-023-581-962; 030-239-260-245-032; 032-474-277-034-664; 032-922-531-685-371; 032-935-744-598-442; 033-085-475-899-252; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-262-322-210-175; 036-316-736-908-394; 037-226-349-498-96X; 044-156-659-231-999; 046-655-266-538-315; 048-084-385-775-90X; 049-170-794-336-34X; 054-872-998-122-172; 055-532-729-324-361; 060-881-928-065-821; 061-373-791-267-531; 062-578-823-005-102; 062-613-015-440-350; 062-834-714-617-177; 062-877-575-225-439; 063-333-506-493-676; 072-862-908-678-93X; 075-164-302-980-027; 077-926-704-396-107; 078-277-495-077-159; 080-553-594-797-530; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 083-620-105-108-236; 084-910-340-397-172; 085-949-866-785-473; 087-547-725-984-955; 090-874-669-983-03X; 091-244-827-139-126; 098-249-554-376-341; 100-628-499-667-09X; 106-008-580-154-233; 110-259-156-108-482; 111-839-995-336-395; 117-677-347-760-402; 121-656-974-147-713; 124-080-108-884-426; 125-120-727-876-476; 128-244-572-962-014; 141-053-469-190-043; 147-774-330-881-083; 149-218-897-988-426; 154-668-456-005-892; 156-586-921-097-184; 157-471-694-925-950; 157-751-496-950-940; 157-881-952-081-749; 160-194-103-540-326; 174-946-917-259-805; 179-292-916-586-371; 188-007-362-092-361; 193-401-749-946-559,5,false,,

What in the governance of public services provision could be accounted for as continuity of progressive change or setback for gender equality when government outsources its function? Recent scholarship in political science shows the status of women has become a global norm and an indicator of development that speaks to the homogenization of an international society. It is widely recognized that economic arrangements that exclude women's participation are detrimental to the overall economic growth of nation-states. Scholars have interpreted the spectacular transformation of women-states relations (women's suffrage, sex quota laws, and women's representation in national policy bureaus) as implying the victory of individualization and of the state as the chief mode of political organization (Towns, 2010). Since 2010, the proportion of seats in a single or lower chamber held by women in national parliaments in Africa, South of the Sahara (all income combined), has been either higher than or equal to global average (World Bank, 2015). As of August 2015, women in national parliaments (both houses combined) represented about 23 percent of World average. Yet, sixteen African states located South of the Sahara make up the top 50 list of countries whose women's representation is higher than 24 percent in national parliaments (IPU, 2015). Not only has universal suffrage been adopted everywhere on the continent, but Liberia, Burundi, Gabon, Malawi, Mauritius, the Central African Republic, and Zambia have joined a small circle of states headed by women albeit with different mandates. Cultural attitudes toward women and structural barriers against their inclusion in public leadership positions are changing thanks to women's organizing and international efforts to bring about gender equality worldwide (Rupp, 1997; True, 2001; Inglehart & Norris, 2003).Change in the core functions of the state through outsourcing schemes, however, forces us to query the resilience of gender equality as a key normative variable for policy diffusion within the international society. This essay is concerned with the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of global pressure for policy reform in public procurement1 and national priorities for gender equality. Public procurement is one way in which governments purchase from the profit and nonprofit private sectors, the goods and services they need to fulfill their public mission.2 How African states have reacted to international pressure to reform public procurement will be made obvious in this contribution. Focus, however, is on the trajectories that gender equality has taken within the context of government outsourcing in Africa. Far from gender norm emulation, global liberal public procurement reform has mainly been diffused in Africa through pressure from international institutions and stronger states. This pattern of policy diffusion, however, works paradoxically with regard to women and gender equality. While it effectively footnotes the gender concerns of women as users of public works, goods, and services, it simultaneously, but selectively hails entrepreneurial categories of gender performance and production by women. …",14,,13,,Government; Social inequality; Political science; Goods and services; Procurement; Universal suffrage; Suffrage; National Policy; Economic growth; Politics,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-4043608001/two-out-bidding-women-public-procurement-reform http://webhost1.cortland.edu/wagadu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/Special-Issue-Volume-14-2.pdf,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-4043608001/two-out-bidding-women-public-procurement-reform,,,3123943027,,0,001-800-976-035-187; 002-935-372-889-717; 005-054-312-795-283; 008-577-106-328-977; 019-789-629-048-759; 020-048-903-574-434; 020-884-399-823-641; 021-443-973-426-505; 023-194-779-005-158; 029-384-133-358-785; 032-301-296-557-991; 035-261-961-935-32X; 040-679-536-802-605; 044-523-553-329-615; 047-812-993-541-791; 050-671-315-820-339; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-404-612-800-195; 058-743-636-616-129; 058-960-195-690-307; 060-085-210-609-677; 060-519-092-358-39X; 068-743-056-517-098; 074-746-395-376-278; 074-753-672-762-835; 076-602-709-425-432; 076-914-082-983-547; 077-632-702-302-062; 078-813-223-896-982; 079-349-391-039-55X; 079-356-605-853-502; 082-025-643-441-017; 083-128-427-871-272; 089-966-656-608-698; 090-325-224-340-048; 094-381-158-460-640; 095-747-067-487-557; 097-504-170-587-376; 098-390-296-561-503; 114-210-410-519-593; 117-197-069-438-321; 121-985-126-692-740; 122-493-694-460-476; 124-400-115-398-75X; 126-746-847-820-515; 132-844-556-814-859; 142-901-337-635-747; 153-264-694-422-192; 161-947-020-010-821; 170-134-770-650-914; 187-866-800-660-728,2,false,,

Teets; William Hurst,"This conclusion presents some closing thoughts covered in the preceding chapters of this book. The book have given us multiple examples of how actors inside Chinese political institutions adapt central signals to engage in compliance, resistance, innovation, and involution, across issue areas ranging from land seizures to electoral reforms. It begins to divide the analyses into four perspectives in terms of mechanisms: compliance, resistance, innovation, and involution. Innovation it is the skillful tweaking of institutions to balance compliance with resistance, adherence to government discipline with concerns about practical governance. The book finds much more variation in diffusion patterns than other authors, and a more nuanced understanding of the politics of diffusion driving this variation at the subnational level. In the book and in other studies it identify many cases where policy experimentation does not diffuse and politically relevant experiments are selected at the expense of socially optimal ones, such as electoral innovation as described in the Kennedy and Chen chapter.",,,23,46,Political economy; Government; Political science; China; Chen; Involution (philosophy); Compliance (psychology); Resistance (psychoanalysis); Corporate governance; Economic system; Politics,,,,,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315796819/chapters/10.4324/9781315796819-10 https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315796819-10/introduction-politics-patterns-policy-diffusion-china-jessica-teets-william-hurst https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/introduction-the-politics-and-patterns-of-policy-diffusion-in-chi,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315796819-10/introduction-politics-patterns-policy-diffusion-china-jessica-teets-william-hurst,,,2626128258,,0,,4,false,,
063-953-832-524-439,"Climate change adaptation, natural hazard mitigation, and innovative responses",2015-09-28,2015,,,,,,Qing Miao,"This dissertation is comprised of three essays which examine innovation, both technological and institutional, as a response aimed to adapting to climate change and natural disasters. Specifically, the first two papers seek to understand the drivers and implications of adaptation-related technological innovations. The third paper draws on the policy innovation theory to examine factors that shape the decision of state governments to engage in comprehensive climate adaptation planning. In Chapter 1, I examine the drivers of technical innovation as an important form of adaptation by investigating the impact of three types of natural disasters—floods, droughts and earthquakes—on the patenting activities of their respective mitigation technologies. Using patent and disaster damage data, this study is the first to empirically examine adaptation responses across multiple sectors at the country level. My empirical analysis, using a panel of 28 countries over a period of 25 years, shows that a country’s risk-mitigating innovations increase significantly with the severity of disasters it has recently experienced, while the degree of impact varies across different types of disasters and technologies. In Chapter 2, I evaluate the effectiveness of the risk-mitigating innovations in reducing disaster impacts in the case of earthquakes. By conceptualizing adaptation as a learning process, I examine the effect of technical knowledge stocks, constructed by patent counts in quake-proof building technologies, and informal knowledge, measured by prior earthquake experiences, on reducing earthquake-related losses. Using a global cross section, I find that countries with more earthquake-mitigation technical innovations and more earthquake exposure in the past suffer fewer fatalities. This “learning-by-doing” effect is much larger in high-income countries, which suggests their stronger adaptive capacity. Finally, Chapter 3 focuses on climate adaptation planning in the U.S. by examining the factors that drive state governments to develop comprehensive adaptation plans. I use an event history analysis to examine both internal factors (states’ climate risks, adaptive capacity and political interests in climate change) and policy diffusion among states within the same climate regions. This study finds that the state-level adaptation decision is highly driven by the extreme weather events the state has recently experienced, and also associated with the state’s potential exposure to climate risks, income level, civic engagement and environmental preferences. By examining the motivation for and barriers to subnational adaptation responses, this research has important implications for environmental federalism and governance. From the innovation perspective, my dissertation contributes to a deeper understanding of adaptation as a dynamic social-learning process, and sheds light on what drives society to adapt to environmental changes and…",,,,,Public economics; Climate change; Natural disaster; Extreme weather; Geography; Civic engagement; Adaptive capacity; Corporate governance; Natural hazard; Adaptation (computer science); Environmental ethics,,,,,https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1273&context=etd https://surface.syr.edu/etd/273/,https://surface.syr.edu/etd/273/,,,1803997173,,0,,0,false,,

Due to the features of the pandemic, which spread over time and space, governments could decide whether or not to follow policy choices made by leaders of countries affected by the virus before them. In this study, we aim to empirically model the adoption of NPIs during the first wave of COVID-19 in the 14 European countries with more than 10 million inhabitants, in order to detect whether a policy diffusion mechanism occurred. By means of a multivariate approach based on Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis, we manage to derive three clusters representing different behaviour models to which the different European countries belong in the different periods of the first wave: pre-pandemic, summer relaxation and deep-lockdown scenarios. These results bring a two-fold contribution: on the one hand, they may help us to understand differences and similarities among European countries during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and guide future quantitative or qualitative studies; on the other, our findings suggest that with minor exceptions (such as Sweden and Poland), different countries adopted very similar policy strategies, which are likely to be due more to the unfolding of the pandemic than to specific governmental strategies.",44,1,22,40,Pandemic; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Psychological intervention; Outbreak; Development economics; Order (exchange); Cluster (spacecraft); Public economics; Economics; Economic growth; Geography; Political science; Regional science; Virology; Medicine; Computer science; Disease; Finance; Pathology; Psychiatry; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Programming language,CA; COVID-19; NPIs; OxCGRT; PCA; Policy convergence; Policy diffusion,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpolmod.2021.11.003,35034999,10.1016/j.jpolmod.2021.11.003,,PMC8750834,0,006-405-284-532-950; 007-566-835-045-459; 008-891-390-659-989; 014-235-773-445-373; 017-010-933-750-388; 020-228-444-328-039; 021-429-382-470-36X; 023-710-551-587-209; 030-214-767-894-911; 031-218-393-481-518; 031-640-222-701-479; 032-430-237-176-938; 033-978-127-271-395; 035-261-961-935-32X; 037-142-084-700-510; 039-429-622-352-340; 041-554-762-154-447; 053-271-230-795-943; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 070-051-190-769-960; 074-465-905-471-400; 076-202-934-875-795; 077-926-704-396-107; 090-849-485-137-053; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 133-012-113-045-346; 146-213-796-969-064,6,true,,green

Kern; Christian Martin,"Most analyses of policy interdependence operate under the assumption that international policy networks can be observed by focusing on the diffusion of one policy across countries. Consequently, if a focal policy is not adopted from one country to the next, researchers usually claim that interdependence is weak and diffusion may have not occurred. In this article we take issue with this argument and challenge the notion that diffusion processes and interdependence entail the same policy diffusing. We posit that national governments, which are usually confronted by a bundle of diffusing policies instead of one unique policy, are often pressed to implement the policy adopted in neighboring countries. At the same time, the decision makers? incentive to implement this instrument may rely on whether the domestic government is more or less dependent on foreign resources and, thus, the policy preferences of foreign constituents. We hold that, conditional on a neighbor?s pressure to adopt a policy, choosing an alternative policy is more likely to occur in countries that are relatively less dependent on economic flows, where governments have more political leeway to model policy diffusion into their strategic advantage. We trace this alteration mechanism using two studies of environmental policy diffusion across space and time. Our analyses suggest that considering only one diffusing policy although alternatives are implemented risks underestimating policy interdependence, as well as biasing inference on the scope of policy diffusion.",61,2,236,252,Public economics; Public policy; Policy analysis; Government; Economics; International economics; Foreign policy analysis; Policy studies; Incentive; Argument; Foreign policy,,,,,http://repository.essex.ac.uk/18645/ https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/61/2/236/3866976 https://core.ac.uk/display/74375399 http://academic.oup.com/isq/article/61/2/236/3866976/Policy-Alteration-Rethinking-Diffusion-Processes https://core.ac.uk/download/74375399.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqx012,,10.1093/isq/sqx012,2588234002,,0,000-267-571-130-101; 002-090-110-364-521; 003-193-896-799-954; 003-353-649-086-180; 008-735-683-583-67X; 009-571-929-011-646; 010-278-292-671-040; 010-297-483-353-575; 011-224-015-287-916; 017-559-575-177-873; 022-831-103-846-54X; 023-614-842-112-254; 025-193-488-999-63X; 025-336-617-303-834; 026-804-045-695-393; 026-897-684-454-102; 032-925-886-572-222; 033-085-475-899-252; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-191-524-623-140; 035-261-961-935-32X; 046-426-817-383-497; 047-464-494-882-163; 047-992-557-420-505; 049-170-794-336-34X; 050-082-471-457-812; 051-563-283-713-00X; 051-757-600-229-955; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-533-264-522-555; 059-106-441-832-440; 060-881-928-065-821; 061-373-791-267-531; 062-613-015-440-350; 063-400-296-712-427; 063-854-160-127-102; 064-336-406-971-626; 065-990-223-615-250; 066-050-117-705-806; 066-658-120-577-759; 073-796-412-498-509; 077-926-704-396-107; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-967-936-260-748; 090-625-041-842-840; 093-809-804-637-585; 094-130-899-799-792; 104-065-881-644-074; 112-071-346-721-120; 115-716-554-714-093; 118-513-543-976-791; 126-880-333-641-920; 128-550-410-877-891; 135-227-744-674-57X; 135-988-131-844-683; 141-054-987-654-05X; 145-047-319-889-865; 145-053-024-293-096; 145-922-139-792-17X; 156-264-681-585-610; 157-471-694-925-950; 165-365-808-288-090,8,true,,green
064-685-841-084-832,A Multi-Level Model of Economic Development Policy Abandonment,2013-08-29,2013,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Eric Stokan,"While the focus of public policy has traditionally been on policy adoption, policy implementation, policy diffusion, and program evaluation, very little attention has been paid to policy abandonment save for recent work by Reese (2009) and Volden (2010) and earlier works under the title of policy termination. Researchers have continued to work toward an understanding of why municipalities adopt incentives for economic development; however, we are only beginning to ask what might compel a state or local government to abandon policies. This article contends that developing a theoretical foundation for policy abandonment is important in the context of local economic development and diminishing budgets. Using three data sources, this paper takes a mixed multi-level approach to understand policy termination at these two levels. First, the author analyzes policy abandonment based on state legislations. Second, the author analyzes the characteristics leading a municipality to be more likely to abandon policies based on three waves of the ICMA economic development survey (1999, 2004, 2009). Finally, a follow up survey of the municipalities from the 2009 ICMA economic development survey uncovers economic developer’s preferences for policy abandonment. This article presents the first hard look at what compels state and local governments to abandon their economic development policies.",,,,,Public economics; Public policy; Policy analysis; Political science; Policy studies; Local economic development; Local government; Abandonment (legal); Context (language use); Incentive; Economic growth,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2300496_code2096786.pdf?abstractid=2300496&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2300496,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2300496,,,1556320139,,0,008-180-005-498-322; 015-247-413-632-815; 016-012-100-132-73X; 021-433-476-162-909; 022-185-795-284-889; 029-572-038-612-368; 034-966-493-162-760; 038-290-155-166-425; 041-725-071-599-504; 051-817-558-098-614; 060-120-616-405-771; 061-744-375-924-897; 065-461-912-054-141; 068-133-906-326-872; 070-368-586-749-080; 073-463-622-996-295; 073-753-993-648-180; 076-240-693-922-091; 080-384-801-164-425; 083-228-416-490-480; 084-954-596-675-708; 100-788-826-272-523; 106-491-634-861-99X; 110-600-497-980-646; 121-985-126-692-740; 123-367-986-920-912; 137-187-749-926-237; 148-460-439-813-652; 193-866-531-142-144,0,false,,

Schmidt; Sebastian Sewerin,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In light of climate change mitigation and the transformation of the energy sector, many jurisdictions have adopted deployment policies for renewable energy (RE) technologies. Several RE deployment policy instruments have diffused from frontrunner countries to other jurisdictions. Switzerland implemented its first comprehensive RE support policy with the adoption of a cost-covering and technology-specific feed-in tariff in 2009, following Germany’s example. Yet, policy designs look very different in the two countries and, importantly, also result in different policy outcomes. In this chapter, we examine the reasons for these policy design differences. We unpack the design of the Swiss feed-in tariff and analyze which of the policy’s elements were directly adopted from Germany and which were accommodated to the Swiss context and why. In particular, we compare the specific instrument designs for two renewable power generation technologies, solar photovoltaics (PV) and biomass, and study the role of technology-related actors in shaping these policy designs. We draw from the policy diffusion and policy transfer literatures and offer important extensions to the literature by showing that, instead of entire policies, it is possible that only certain design elements of a policy diffuse from one jurisdiction to another. Additionally, we find that the composition of the existing technology-related actor bases in the donor and recipient countries is important in determining whether the accommodation of the design elements to the domestic context occurs.</jats:p>",,,93,113,Feed-in tariff; Business; Accommodation; International economics; Policy transfer,,,,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-80787-0_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80787-0_5,,10.1007/978-3-030-80787-0_5,3217794470,,0,000-159-936-230-642; 002-068-126-397-546; 003-619-715-013-859; 011-224-015-287-916; 013-731-270-122-755; 014-676-526-941-090; 020-328-468-564-86X; 020-354-144-843-204; 022-774-738-500-720; 025-397-315-915-367; 026-194-037-954-943; 028-256-865-423-025; 032-811-169-005-588; 033-546-034-840-908; 035-689-436-224-80X; 038-924-046-084-895; 039-120-768-518-395; 040-026-351-798-592; 043-547-850-265-638; 045-112-141-870-624; 050-173-626-765-961; 050-274-654-059-514; 050-883-494-050-361; 053-271-230-795-943; 058-373-652-525-811; 058-668-244-624-560; 060-188-437-067-341; 064-463-299-403-755; 064-705-706-553-734; 065-761-513-208-187; 066-050-117-705-806; 075-202-523-360-467; 078-130-244-158-871; 079-089-312-064-709; 079-705-757-170-703; 083-863-360-116-889; 084-526-184-385-05X; 086-341-446-522-651; 087-445-964-619-886; 100-054-963-115-118; 101-476-230-624-982; 115-667-337-333-237; 118-441-306-901-446; 118-513-543-976-791; 121-257-361-327-879; 128-412-145-076-659; 129-132-843-041-226; 132-776-996-178-495; 135-210-605-672-143; 151-957-596-917-668; 169-259-977-267-254; 172-070-974-127-247; 172-581-065-434-148,0,true,cc-by,hybrid
064-768-305-539-26X,Foreign Policy Learning,2017-05-24,2017,reference entry,Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics,,Oxford University Press,,Guy Ziv,"<p>An improved understanding of foreign policy learning necessitates a clarification of what foreign policy learning is, who learns, and how such learning occurs. Cognitive and social psychologists, sociologists, and political scientists situated in a variety of subfields have contributed to the understanding of foreign policy learning, a multidisciplinary area of inquiry. Learning theorists seek to show how a change in an actor’s beliefs due to experience or observation can lead to changes at other units, such as organizations and within the government. This cognitive dimension is important because actors may pursue a new course of action for politically expedient reasons rather than having genuinely “learned”—a distinction referred to as “complex” vs. “simple” learning.</p>;                <p>Foreign policy learning can be internal or external. The former type of learning entails what individuals, governments, or organizations learn from their prior experience. Learning theorists who focus on the individual level of analysis borrow insights from political psychology in an effort to shed light on the personal characteristics, the belief structures, and the cognitive psychological mechanisms of political actors that can better inform policymaking. Leaders whose cognitive structures are described as relatively open and complex—like Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whose learning brought about the dramatic changes that ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union—are more likely to alter their beliefs than their cognitively closed and simple counterparts.</p>;                <p>Yet external learning occurs as well. Policy diffusion studies show that learning can result from demonstration effects. Foreign policy learning via diffusion is not instrumental, but instead occurs through osmosis. Privatization in the former communist states, China’s Foreign Direct Investment liberalization, and the diffusion of environmental norms in the European Union are examples of learning that is contagious, not chosen. A more conscious mode of learning than diffusion is policy transfer, which entails policymakers’ transferring ideas from one country and implementing them in another. Technological innovations, unlike lessons that involve political ideology, are generally easier lessons to transfer—for example, Japan’s success in applying lessons from the West to modernize its army in the second half of the 19th century.</p>;                <p>The constraints to foreign policy learning are formidable. Decision makers are not always open to reconsidering views that challenge their beliefs. Leaders tend to resort to, and misuse, analogies that prevent learning. Even a change in a decision maker’s beliefs may not lead to foreign policy change, given the myriad political pressures, bureaucratic hurdles, and economic realities that often get in the way of implementing new ideas. Indeed, foreign policy learning and foreign policy change are not synonymous.</p>;                <p>Scholars face significant obstacles in studying foreign policy learning. There is no consensus on the definition of learning, on what constitutes learning, on how actors learn, when they learn, or on how to assess whether learning has taken place. Despite attempts to make sense of the confusion, scholars face the daunting challenge of improving understanding of how learning is shaped and funneled through the interaction of agents and the structures in which they are situated, as well as the relationship between learning and foreign policy change.</p>",,,,,Public policy; Policy analysis; Political economy; Political science; Foreign policy analysis; Policy studies; Policy transfer; Foreign relations; Education policy; Economic system; Foreign policy,,,,,http://politics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-428 https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-428,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.428,,10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.428,2600958391,,0,,2,false,,

The formulation of these policies may be linked to factors of the domestic political and economic situation and also to the institutional encouragement and international cultural standard, as discussed in the literature on the Theories of Policy Diffusion and Policy Transfer. This article presents the results of ongoing research that investigates Brazilian social policies for poverty reduction under the Cardoso, Lula, and Rousseff administrations. It suggests that so-called positive modeling predominated as national policies were linked to international policies focusing on the low-income population and that the international political community considered Brazilian conditional cash transfer policies as a model. In the second Lula and Rousseff administrations, there was negative modeling (i.e., contrary to international recommendations) between policies of economic growth and increasing or maintaining the values of social public spending; international financial institutions prescribe economic austerity and a reduction of social public policy. At the same time, there was positive modeling due to the centrality that the administrations have assigned to policies focusing on the low-income population. This centrality may bring a risk to the universalist perspective.; ; ; ; La relacion entre las politicas para la reduccion de la pobreza y las prescripciones de las organizaciones internacionales podria explicar las similitudes de las politicas en los paises que tienen diversidades economicas y culturales. La formulacion de tales politicas podria estar vinculada a factores economicos y de politica interna y tambien al incentivo cultural e institucional internacional, como se discute en la literatura sobre la difusion y la transferencia de las politicas. En este articulo se presentan los resultados de la investigacion en curso sobre las politicas brasilenas para reducir la pobreza en los gobiernos Cardoso, Lula y Rousseff. Los resultados sugieren que durante estos gobiernos el llamado modelo positivo predomino debido a la congruencia entre las directrices nacionales e internacionales sobre el foco sobre la poblacion de bajos ingresos y tambien debido al hecho de que las politicas sociales brasilenas fueron consideradas internacionalmente como un ejemplo. En el segundo gobierno Lula y en el gobierno Rousseff fue identificado un modelo negativo (es decir, en la direccion opuesta a las recomendaciones internacionales), entre la articulacion de las politicas de crecimiento economico y el aumento o mantenimiento del gasto publico social. Esto es contrario a las recomendaciones de las instituciones financieras internacionales que prescriben las medidas de austeridad y la disminucion de la politica social. No obstante, se mantuvo tambien un modelo positivo, debido al papel central que los gobiernos conceden a las politicas enfocadas a la poblacion de bajos ingresos.

This study leverages the coincidence of the 2005 French referendum on the European Constitution and the fieldwork of two surveys to analyze the causal effect of cross-national social influence.

065-026-263-077-83X,"Why international cooperation on greening tax system failed? -The Case of EU, Nordic Countries, and Netherlands -",2016-02-01,2016,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Shintaro Kurachi; Kazuaki Sato; Leo Shimamura,"This article shows how the policy of imposing an environmental tax diffused through Nordic countries and the Netherlands. Tax policy continues to depend on political factors, even though globalization has progressed recently. However, policy coordination in international organizations and between developed countries also affects tax policy. There are three underlying factors for relating the introduction and enlargement of environmental tax to international cooperation. First, environmental problems have been internationalized. Particularly, global warming and acid rain are no longer just regional environmental problems, and international capital flows have enhanced these problems' importance. Second, environmental taxation may become an alternative means of raising financial resources in place of the decreasing income tax rate and may also facilitate international capital flows. Actually, the tax structures in developed countries have tended to move from direct to indirect taxation since the 1980s. Third, if a small country introduces environmental taxation in advance under the open global economy, its competiveness might decrease owing to increasing domestic product cost. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce deduction rules for industry incentives simultaneously with the introduction or increase of environmental tax. Environmental taxation may offer a double dividend, not only improving the environment but also reducing tax system costs. However, this measure may cause the double dividend to decrease. Considering this environmental problem and international aspects of environmental taxation together, international policy cooperation over environmental taxation or the introduction of global environmental taxation emerge as options for developed countries. Carbon tax was introduced in Finland (1990), Sweden (1991), Norway (1991), Denmark (1992), and the Netherlands (1992), in succession. The policy of imposing a carbon tax subsequently diffused among the European Union (EU) countries: for example, England (2001) and Germany (1998~). However, with the exception of Switzerland and Ireland, the policy of environmental taxation has not diffused since the 1990s. In EU countries, the share of tax revenue from environmental tax in the GDP and overall revenue has decreased. This article argues that the failure of the movement toward environmental taxation in the 1990s has a path dependency. Previous research shows that the Nordic Council coordinated carbon tax introduction in Nordic countries. Although the carbon tax rate that Nordic countries introduced was very low, a deduction was introduced to avoid decreasing competiveness (Andersen, M., E. Martin & A. Ryelund, 2006:11). The pace of environmental taxation policy diffusion has been slower and flatter than that of other environmental policies, although this mechanism was based not on legal harmonization and levied compulsory burden, but information exchange between policy makers (Busch, P. & H. J?rgens, 2005). The environmental tax rate was low and policy diffusion was slow because of the strong stance of domestic actors against a policy decision. On the other hand, to facilitate the introduction of environmental taxation in the Netherlands, the EC model proposed in the 1980s was adopted (Andersen, M., E. Martin & A. Ryelund, 2006:11). Simultaneously, the Netherlands took the position that ""it should be evaluated from the point of view of whether introduction by one country may inspire international introduction"" (Okuma, 1993:154). However, researchers do not always discuss how international cooperation in Nordic countries or the Netherlands affected environmental taxation coordination. Therefore, this article analyzes how the introduction of environmental (carbon) tax in Nordic countries and the Netherlands related to international cooperation in the EU or Nordic Council through consideration of environmental tax theory under the global economy and current policy discussion. This analysis shows the current problem of international cooperation regarding environmental taxation. The findings of this article are as follows. First, tax cooperation in the EU has failed thus far, and the character of cooperation has changed from active proposals against environmental and carbon taxation to tax harmonization to coordinate the competitive conditions in the single market. Thereby, the environmental tax structure corresponded sufficiently to international competiveness and this caused tax exemption and low tax rates. This measure increased political acceptability in each country, although the advantage of environmental tax, for example for cost efficiency, has decreased. Second, the chain introduction of carbon tax in Nordic countries was the result of cooperation using economic measures of environmental policy. The driving factors are (1) coordinating environmental protection and institutions to encourage voluntary domestic environmental legislation, (2) resolving the problem of international competiveness and carbon dioxide emissions, (3) finding alternate tax resources for decreasing income tax rates associated with the introduction of dual income taxation. However, while voluntary policy cooperation in Nordic countries made policy diffusion easier, it made the integration of tax rates more difficult, and this tax rate difference has remained. Third, the Netherlands was affected by the EC proposal, and supported it when the country introduced the carbon tax. At the same time, institutional design decreases the burden on industry from the point of view of international competiveness. After that, however, the Netherlands has been on an independent path, regardless of the failure of carbon tax harmonization in other EU countries.",,,,,Value-added tax; Indirect tax; International trade; Economics; International economics; Direct tax; Tax rate; Double taxation; Tax reform; Ad valorem tax; International taxation,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/keo/dpaper/2016-001.html https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:keo:dpaper:2016-001 https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/keodpaper/2016-001.htm,https://ideas.repec.org/p/keo/dpaper/2016-001.html,,,2284467380,,0,,0,false,,
065-285-203-860-116,Global REACH?: The Potential International Impact of EU Chemicals Regulation,,2009,,,,,,Katja Biedenkopf,"The central question of this paper is: Could the new EU chemicals regulation REACH play a role in international chemicals governance – and if so, how? The REACH; Regulation is one of the largest and most controversial pieces of legislation that the EU has ever adopted. It introduces a comprehensive and ambitious system for; chemicals management, which moves away from a hazard-based approach toward a more risk-based approach. Furthermore, REACH introduces increased responsibilities for private actors and aims at encouraging more innovation. These; new EU rules for the management of chemical substances are more comprehensive and more ambitious than current efforts at the international level. Therefore, this paper argues that there could be a mutual supplementation of international chemicals initiatives and REACH. On the one hand, REACH could complement international activities through the diffusion of its ambitious requirements and the; data that it will produce. Diffusion could potentially happen faster than the international negotiation procedures and create facts that facilitate consensus finding; for ensuing international agreement. Policy diffusion could also potentially reach a very broad scope of countries, including jurisdictions that are not part of current; international agreements. On the other hand, international organisations could foster and enhance the diffusion process and institutionalise some of the REACH provisions. Furthermore, international agreements play an important role in taking particular account of the situation of developing countries and in providing a certain ‘baseline’ degree of safe international chemicals management. This paper first introduces the main features of the REACH Regulation. Then, it describes the international system of chemicals governance before discussing the contribution that REACH could make to this system. In the subsequent section, the different ways in which REACH requirements could diffuse to other jurisdictions and benefit international governance are analysed. These conceptual considerations are then applied to the US and California in a brief discussion of first signs of the potential influence of REACH.

Hays,"This study considers how states change policy innovations as they diffuse. This process of policy evolution during diffusion, known as reinvention, has been the focus of recent work on innovation diffusion in the states (Clark, 1985; Glick, 1992; Glick & Hays, 1991; Mooney & Lee, 1995). This manuscript focuses on differences in the patterns of reinvention for three different policy innovations with different rates of diffusion: child abuse reporting laws, crime victim compensation laws, and public campaign funding laws. Moreover, how the pattern changes after states amend their initial laws is examined. The data show evidence of reinvention during diffusion but provide only limited support for the first hypothesis that the pattern of reinvention is one of increasing comprehensiveness over time. Consistent with expectations, the data reveal little relationship between the date of adoption and the current law's comprehensiveness, including amendment.",24,4,551,566,Positive economics; Diffusion (business); Political science; Child abuse reporting; Innovation diffusion; Public administration,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.1996.tb01646.x/abstract https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/patterns-of-reinvention-the-nature-of-evolution-during-policy-dif https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1541-0072.1996.tb01646.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0072.1996.tb01646.x,,10.1111/j.1541-0072.1996.tb01646.x,1903914970,,0,005-261-328-376-894; 015-591-021-271-179; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-419-031-338-034; 036-961-749-635-681; 051-528-890-718-626; 057-747-004-001-777; 067-490-686-317-462; 071-361-180-414-699; 076-240-693-922-091; 085-466-333-938-784; 091-394-237-745-859; 101-127-387-013-017; 114-000-234-785-490; 123-288-456-400-05X; 173-256-407-940-663,45,false,,

066-182-936-475-690,The Diffusion of Policy Frames: Evidence from a Structural Topic Model,,2016,,,,,,Fabrizio Gilardi; Charles R. Shipan; Bruno R. Wueest,"Policy diffusion occurs when policies in one unit (e.g., countries, states, cities) are influenced by the prior adoption of policies in other units. Although numerous studies have convincingly documented this phenomenon, they have, with very few exceptions, generally ignored a crucial step in the diffusion process—namely, how policies are framed ahead of their adoption. Policy frames—the discussion of a policy from particular viewpoints—play a crucial role in linking the actions of previous units with the potential actions in other units. In this paper, we identify policy frames and examine their link with prior policy adoptions. We focus on the area of restrictions on smoking in U.S. states. Our analysis draws upon an original dataset of more than four million paragraphs from articles published in 50 American newspapers covering 47 states between 1996 and 2014. We use structural topic models to estimate how smoking bans have been framed and how frames change as a function of policy adoption in other states. We find that, as more neighboring states enact legislation restricting smoking, concerns about the restaurant business decrease; worries about the casino business increase; detailed regulations such as ventilation requirements or separate rooms for smokers are discussed less frequently; voters’ support and involvement in the decisionmaking process surrounding smoking bans are discussed more frequently; the compatibility of smoking restrictions with individual rights loses salience as a topic; and the passage of legislation is discussed more frequently, while the process by which decisions are made loses salience. These findings establish a foothold for the usefulness of structural topic models and support for the idea that policy frames are an important part of the diffusion process.",,,,,Public economics; Topic model; Political science; Newspaper; Legislation; Smoking restrictions; Public relations; Phenomenon,,,,,,,,,2553958050,,0,001-367-136-082-787; 001-481-906-279-295; 002-557-636-257-591; 010-692-603-395-244; 010-876-414-212-919; 012-367-777-689-406; 019-276-806-423-182; 021-937-535-527-840; 023-672-511-213-267; 026-555-507-636-650; 029-515-235-558-072; 034-962-763-834-275; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-707-766-001-812; 039-664-709-632-96X; 045-119-468-177-524; 050-082-471-457-812; 057-845-319-379-490; 058-071-798-060-611; 067-505-607-492-596; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-492-147-661-549; 077-945-151-328-246; 079-798-642-602-014; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-230-651-384-812; 086-390-693-985-048; 087-401-099-506-371; 096-305-535-716-217; 099-406-458-689-13X; 104-512-929-235-758; 111-719-910-096-809; 116-251-397-473-562; 118-513-543-976-791; 128-313-523-172-725; 136-353-418-663-270; 148-460-439-813-652; 156-586-921-097-184; 163-523-615-895-976; 174-601-718-141-931; 176-503-345-697-964; 182-519-878-888-855,1,false,,

This article examines the key drivers behind China’s 2011 decision to opt for ETS as a GHG mitigating policy tool and what lay behind the choice of the system’s design features. Given the existence of the frontrunner EU ETS and that market mechanisms have spread across the world in recent years, we analyze the role played by policy diffusion in the decision to launch an ETS and in the subsequent design process, seen in relation to domestic drivers. The article investigates policy developments culminating in the 2011 carbon market announcement, and the reasons these design elements were chosen for the pilot schemes and the national market in the period 2011–2017. The article contributes to our understanding of policy diffusion at different stages of policy development in China, by revealing which diffusion mechanism is more prevalent at different stages. We find first that overall domestic conditions and drivers had the most consistent impact on policy decisions to establish a carbon market and on the selected sectors. However, a second key finding is that the role of policy diffusion varied over time, with such diffusion, in the form of ideational impact, playing the most important role early on, providing a powerful inducement for China to go for a carbon market. Third, sophisticated learning from international projects took place in the pilots, allowing China to adapt policies and design features to match local conditions. 中国发展ETS作为缓解温室气体效应的政策工具：是政策扩散还是国内驱动？ 2017年末，中国启动了国家碳排放交易计划(ETS)。本文分析了2011年中国决定选择ETS作为温室气体(GHG) 效应缓解政策工具的主要驱动因素以及系统设计特点的选择原因。鉴于先锋欧盟ETS的存在，又由于市场机制近年来已遍布世界，笔者分析了政策扩散在启动ETS的决定中所起的作用，以及随后的设计过程中与国内驱动的关系。本文探讨了2011年碳市场公告的政策发展，以及这些设计要素被选择作为2011‐2017年间试点方案和国家市场的原因。本文通过揭示哪一种扩散机制在不同阶段更为普遍，有助于加强大家对中国政策发展不同阶段政策扩散的认识。笔者首先发现，总体国内条件和驱动因素对建立碳市场的政策决定和选定的部门产生了最一致的影响。然而，第二个关键发现在于，政策扩散的作用随着时间的推移而有所不同，这种扩散以观念影响的形式进行，在早期发挥着最重要的作用，为中国走向碳市场提供了强大的动力。第三个发现是，通过国际项目试点过程的深入学习，中国能够根据当地情况调整政策和设计特色。 El desarrollo de ETS en China como una herramienta de politica de mitigacion de GEI: ?Un caso de difusion de politicas o impulsores domesticos?

Kreitzer; Frederick J. Boehmke,"Pooled event history analysis (PEHA) allows researchers to study the effects of variables across multiple policies by stacking the data and estimating the parameters in a single model. Yet this approach to modeling policy diffusion implies assumptions about homogeneity that are often violated in reality, such that the effect of a given variable is constant across policies. We relax this assumption and use Monte Carlo simulations to compare common strategies for modeling heterogeneity, testing these strategies with increasing levels of variance. We find that multilevel models with random coefficients produce the best estimates and are a significant improvement over other models. In addition, we show how modeling similar policies as multilevel structures allows researchers to more precisely explore the theoretical implications of heterogeneity across policies.

Fording; Dana Patton,"Over the last five years, many states have sought to limit access to Medicaid by adopting restrictive policies. How can we reconcile this development with studies that imply that Medicaid should be insulated from policy backlash? The answer lies in understanding the policy feedback effects that accompanied Medicaid expansion and how these effects created electoral pressure that led to policy modification. We situate our expectations within a policy diffusion framework that accounts for variation in both the content and timing of policy adoptions across states. We develop and test several hypotheses using survey data and an original dataset on gubernatorial support for Medicaid work requirements.

Smith,"Abstract; This chapter presents a theoretical and historical account of the OECD policy diffusion mechanisms, specifically addressing their influence on teacher policy. In order to present our argument, the chapter is divided in three sections. First, we present a historical description of how the Directorate of Education and Skills of the OECD has become a central figure in global policy discussions. Then, we address the particular mechanisms through which the OECD is able to expand their influence. We argue that the scientific validation of their recommendations through country reviews and the invitation to participate in large-scale studies and surveys, such as the Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) and the Teaching and Learning Survey (TALIS), have become pivotal for communicating policy messages concerning teacher quality and development. Next, we argue that while OECD recommendations are engrained in notions of human capital, their work on teachers has incorporated elements of professional capital. Additionally, we stress how the influence of social science and large-scale survey studies has contributed to the development of a concept of teacher professionalization promoted by the OECD.",31,,157,180,Impact assessment; Work (electrical); Political science; Order (exchange); Pedagogy; Human capital; Professionalization; Argument; Public relations; Education policy; Capital (economics),,,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S1479-367920160000031009/full/html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/s1479-367920160000031009,,10.1108/s1479-367920160000031009,2612827373,,0,001-504-535-048-621; 002-877-403-305-399; 006-914-990-390-406; 011-889-266-676-031; 018-534-406-869-575; 022-292-396-908-723; 024-812-598-519-645; 025-855-247-200-25X; 027-299-698-717-192; 027-726-661-711-380; 035-736-597-390-138; 039-866-193-409-083; 045-442-473-713-168; 056-125-269-992-008; 063-167-178-679-306; 063-794-893-811-540; 064-981-905-585-684; 068-517-654-081-559; 069-701-574-295-289; 082-355-166-506-35X; 086-739-879-967-939; 087-187-839-035-567; 095-579-060-578-27X; 096-335-064-526-368; 097-035-455-217-88X; 097-955-541-151-268; 106-822-673-515-356; 110-150-284-222-555; 114-698-621-771-045; 121-406-773-792-765; 126-318-205-670-825; 131-460-142-167-808; 137-618-108-625-823; 139-085-850-853-592; 144-302-868-749-530; 154-341-676-318-503; 156-244-245-410-226; 156-618-278-264-417; 163-060-064-917-906,7,false,,

We report updated data on market liberalizations and analyze countries’ aggregate trends and sectoral patterns. In particular, we explore such heterogeneity in market liberalization patterns and analyze the role played by government ideology. We show that right-wing governments pushed for privatization policies more intensively than left-oriented ones, whereas left-wing governments favored liberalization over privatization. Thus, within the common neoliberalism wave, a partisan trade-off between privatization and liberalization seems to have characterized OECD countries’ governance of network industries. We propose and discuss various interpretations of these findings, including the role of policy diffusion dynamics, swing voters signaling, possible policy reversal and institutional drivers effects, the role of public finance concerns, and the emergence of new political agendas.",,,117,144,Nonmarket forces; Neoliberalism; Business; Government; Public finance; Market economy; Corporate governance; Barriers to entry; Liberalization; Politics,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43717-0_5 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43717-0_5/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43717-0_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-43717-0_5,,10.1007/978-3-319-43717-0_5,2518684791,,0,004-177-952-255-529; 004-445-385-746-898; 004-695-389-818-758; 010-627-574-290-564; 013-304-275-742-412; 014-437-678-470-664; 014-676-777-092-812; 017-544-843-703-154; 025-031-790-564-969; 026-849-099-193-208; 027-541-010-345-937; 027-915-441-047-185; 029-121-613-663-821; 029-848-381-697-869; 029-915-139-593-735; 035-779-586-472-162; 037-054-591-089-402; 037-230-915-636-75X; 041-066-595-218-438; 041-419-035-219-708; 042-713-490-714-19X; 044-393-758-213-373; 044-493-070-507-056; 050-911-843-277-085; 056-972-022-870-487; 057-515-317-175-134; 058-290-845-056-675; 059-186-065-242-289; 061-323-768-959-702; 062-382-289-446-578; 062-926-702-792-486; 066-068-678-693-695; 066-294-852-626-275; 067-152-198-033-67X; 070-523-157-636-675; 072-087-500-670-286; 076-034-259-320-226; 076-602-709-425-432; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-817-596-065-297; 081-177-667-429-801; 087-907-343-416-326; 099-298-144-531-852; 102-653-788-989-762; 107-617-345-832-727; 108-225-053-017-660; 113-615-575-368-50X; 115-143-675-379-513; 117-080-995-943-758; 120-679-743-449-103; 123-617-408-731-414; 128-112-411-381-740; 129-964-024-494-813; 136-814-509-425-381; 141-596-092-614-360; 145-272-132-500-435; 149-562-207-299-387; 153-848-373-999-723; 161-538-724-112-976; 163-882-919-320-981; 166-761-259-166-736; 167-071-346-119-717; 170-422-690-906-517; 182-087-251-579-112; 189-561-296-644-651; 194-439-692-160-060; 195-694-959-727-228,0,false,,

This chapter aims at developing a simple computational model based on a theoretical model of policy diffusion (Braun &amp; Gilardi, 2006) that helps to explain the emergence of diffusion in a complex system. Based on three simple conditions (ready, choose, change) and a few internal and external characteristics that define countries and their interactions, the model presented in this chapter shows that policies do diffuse and lead to local convergence and global divergence. Moreover, it takes time for a country to introduce the best-suited policy and for this policy to become very effective.

067-956-122-316-749,European policy diffusion and the Global South: A constructivist institutionalist analysis of the EU-ACP Economic Partnership Agreements,,2013,,,,,,Tony Heron; Peg Murray-Evans,"The following paper offers a theoretical and substantive contribution to recent debates on EU policy diffusion with a specific focus on the ACP group of countries. The question we are most concerned with is why - in spite of the obvious material power asymmetries - has the EU encountered such difficulties in the attempt to translate its normative preferences for freer trade and closer economic integration into a series of binding agreements? We take our cue from the embryonic (predominantly) constructivist literature in this area emphasising the role of transnational advocacy coalitions - but argue that these accounts do not go far enough in the exploration of non-material correlates of trade negotiations by considering the EU’s own discursive strategy. To address this oversight, we draw on Craig Parsons’ (2007) distinction between ideational and institutional logics of explanation to understand how the invocation of institutional constraints affects the impact of particular discursive strategies. We argue that the EU’s case for reform initially rested on a strong convergence between institutions and ideas, enabling the EU to discursively present desired policy reforms as necessary to satisfy multilateral trade rules. However, in due course the institutional dynamics behind the latter began to diverge from the EU’s policy preferences and blunt the EU’s discursive strategy - thus creating the space for transnational coalitions to, first, question and, ultimately, in small measure undermine the EU’s trade and development prospectus for the ACP.",,,,,Public economics; Political economy; Political science; Spite; Negotiation; Trade and development; Convergence (economics); Economic Partnership Agreements; Prospectus; Normative; Economic integration,,,,,,,,,2183249670,,0,003-280-929-671-291; 003-628-352-044-22X; 006-341-460-702-091; 008-560-606-156-322; 014-107-885-532-117; 020-570-819-076-880; 021-701-464-382-216; 023-616-943-842-490; 024-203-506-608-437; 027-738-023-581-962; 029-602-125-271-754; 030-087-946-763-31X; 035-762-699-112-154; 037-382-893-466-114; 039-816-589-280-866; 042-166-832-672-947; 042-441-252-868-330; 050-081-143-198-263; 057-672-652-205-598; 058-301-626-567-062; 058-368-122-176-814; 059-574-767-511-353; 062-600-611-340-88X; 065-627-374-982-836; 065-963-624-379-742; 069-438-209-472-747; 080-218-596-034-408; 080-679-765-908-922; 082-260-433-363-751; 083-165-538-558-695; 083-652-615-890-324; 084-128-569-849-616; 095-599-600-817-058; 103-970-014-944-136; 112-237-017-887-442; 118-318-016-946-511; 121-600-193-718-699; 127-571-432-201-039; 130-236-098-916-791; 137-149-220-755-098; 143-669-366-682-748; 144-332-009-854-751; 149-148-509-615-660; 153-988-755-438-918; 181-107-813-873-516; 187-933-150-419-963; 188-795-033-650-553,2,false,,

Is there evidence that policy-related knowledge and ideas in the foreign policy realm are transferred between jurisdictions? This article addresses this question in the context of the relationship between two fraternal social democratic parties – the British Labour Party and the Australian Labor Party. It focuses on the period between 2006 and 2010, which covers Kevin Rudd’s assumption of the Labor leadership and his first term as Prime Minister and the transition from Tony Blair to Gordon Brown in June 2007. Kevin Rudd’s Prime Ministership was terminated in a party room coup in June 2010 while Gordon Brown led the British Labour Party to electoral defeat one month earlier. The article investigates three prominent areas of foreign policy – regional engagement, climate change, and aid and international development – to evaluate the extent of policy transfer a...",37,5,456,470,Sociology; Foreign policy analysis; Policy transfer; Realm; Context (language use); Period (music); Public administration; Regionalism (politics); International development; Foreign policy,,,,,https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01442872.2016.1188909 https://core.ac.uk/display/143905679 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01442872.2016.1188909,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2016.1188909,,10.1080/01442872.2016.1188909,2466977532,,0,005-724-658-892-443; 007-758-759-157-059; 014-525-847-333-91X; 014-706-639-367-587; 017-549-788-859-078; 018-465-884-123-202; 026-412-549-797-331; 027-367-540-779-918; 030-569-509-190-578; 032-082-712-760-781; 033-572-835-125-145; 036-491-024-054-704; 037-670-598-718-194; 041-153-645-343-022; 044-260-343-856-052; 047-507-863-545-988; 052-201-386-466-679; 055-038-236-730-704; 055-879-313-256-564; 065-726-257-833-827; 065-804-401-887-979; 068-007-035-945-311; 073-536-136-578-279; 081-568-956-567-520; 082-124-760-487-894; 096-942-539-397-489; 100-460-762-930-005; 115-667-337-333-237; 116-029-377-315-228; 117-677-347-760-402; 121-990-511-502-970; 127-421-851-526-037; 128-310-233-924-104; 133-592-849-317-15X; 136-773-174-954-514; 137-320-561-087-11X; 158-837-741-913-283; 163-186-691-087-204; 167-123-502-871-479; 183-200-734-650-399; 192-407-366-011-220; 198-509-340-890-47X,2,false,,

Yet instead of pursuing local diversity, many governments chose to emulate programs made famous elsewhere. What explains the diffusion of social programs across Brazil? This article investigates whether policy makers are motivated by political self-interest, ideology, or socialized norms. It draws on an event history analysis of two innovative programs that have diffused throughout Brazil's largest cities: Bolsa Escola, an education program, and Programa Saude da Familia, a family health program. The author argues that political incentives, such as electoral competition, cannot explain diffusion.

Savage,"This essay summarizes the state of research on policy diffusion among the American states. Recognizing that this policy diffusion literature largely exhibits a geographic focus rather than the client focus predominant in most other diffusion research, the argument is nevertheless made that this field of diffusion studies has not yet become welded into a distinctive college of mutually aware scholars. Still, following Everett Rogers' model of the diffusion process, American state policy diffusion studies are reviewed so as to present emerging generalizations, current blindspots suggested by Rogers' model, and departures from other diffusion research findings. Diffusion of judicial innovations is reviewed separately as a special subset of policy diffusion research. Finally, policy diffusion research is related to larger concerns with societal development and change and with democratic politics.",15,4,1,28,Positive economics; Diffusion (business); Political science; State (polity); Field (Bourdieu); Societal development; Democratic politics; Research findings; Public administration; Argument; Federalism,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3330039 https://academic.oup.com/publius/article-abstract/15/4/1/1879578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a037561,,10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a037561,2152647903,,0,,89,false,,

Bain; Julie A. Podmore,"LGBTQ2S municipal governance is a contentious policy domain that is often publicly framed as ‘morality’ or ‘niche’ politics, yet urban sexuality scholars have shown its fundamental dissonance and incommensurability across spatial scales. Within polycentric city-regions aspiring to ‘progressiveness’, LGBTQ2S-supportive municipal social inclusion policy is further subject to arrhythmic diffusion. In this article we introduce the neologism of scalar arrhythmia (a biomedical metaphor that parallels the pace of diffusion with the irregularities of a heartbeat) in conjunction with scale-contingent coalitional moments (spatiotemporal junctures that bring people together to enact social change) to advance an urban social justice agenda. We argue that the analytical vantage point of scalar arrhythmia reveals differences in the longitudinal temporal (a)synchronicities of peripheral municipal inclusion policy diffusion and locates transformative scale-contingent coalitional moments. Through an analysis of the interplay of diffusion processes and mechanisms across the adjacent peripheral municipalities of Burnaby, New Westminster and Surrey in Canada's Vancouver city-region, we demonstrate provincial–municipal hierarchical ‘coercion’, core–periphery metropolitan relocation ‘imitation’ and municipal inter-peripheral contagious ‘competition’. While peripheral patterns of scalar arrhythmia rupture Vancouver's illusive progressive regionalism, the concept offers civic leaders an inventorying opportunity that redirects attention away from cursory LGBTQ2S policy performances towards substantive policy integrations and local innovations.",46,5,784,806,Political economy; Sociology; Politics; Political science; Economic geography; Economics; Law,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-2427.13121,,10.1111/1468-2427.13121,,,0,003-115-590-694-769; 004-351-886-226-770; 008-116-342-747-346; 009-252-532-191-281; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-234-073-430-274; 025-927-691-153-680; 028-530-917-161-960; 030-097-772-325-975; 030-862-820-716-82X; 034-066-693-638-993; 038-002-020-038-769; 042-566-899-911-634; 043-575-848-389-613; 047-041-461-955-798; 049-572-800-867-035; 053-193-162-707-866; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-086-116-189-02X; 062-994-760-221-651; 064-329-645-196-57X; 074-519-935-894-691; 074-913-291-351-282; 078-077-602-728-097; 078-685-396-532-163; 084-381-947-064-111; 086-752-583-397-523; 088-919-425-365-248; 101-321-458-003-203; 101-958-767-084-324; 104-309-737-903-404; 116-226-131-502-413; 116-553-975-557-359; 127-112-114-178-723; 130-438-068-576-656; 133-615-869-460-390; 135-357-075-029-666; 136-498-746-968-361; 140-998-181-173-89X; 183-665-646-910-752,0,false,,

Accordingly, the promotion of regionalism and the furthering of ‘South-South’ trade are seen as vital components in cushioning the loss of preferences and smoothing the transition to reciprocal free trade. In the case of the EPAs — again the main focus of the chapter — the EU has arguably gone the furthest in this direction by introducing a so-called ‘regional preference’ clause by which the removal of intraregional trade barriers between ACP countries represented a precondition for the maintenances of trade privileges (albeit now on the basis of reciprocity). This mechanism can be traced back to the Cotonou Agreement, which linked the successful conclusion of WTO-compatible EPAs to creating and consolidating regional institutions in accordance with the regional configurations identified later by the European Commission. The general vagueness of Cotonou meant that, at the time, the precise means by which these two processes would be causally linked remained underspecified.",,,56,82,International trade; Political science; Trade barrier; Vagueness; Reciprocal; Regional integration; Cotonou Agreement; Free trade; Regionalism (international relations); Politics,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137307927_4 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137307927_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9781137307927_4,,10.1057/9781137307927_4,2491558749,,0,,0,false,,

070-108-191-959-584,The causes and consequences of tax policy,,2008,,,,,,Nicholas Weller,"An extensive literature in political science focuses on government expenditures. In my dissertation, however, I focus on taxation, because governments must tax their citizens in order to engage in any of the choices about distributing that revenue. Each empirical chapter in this dissertation examines a different aspect of tax policy. In Trading Policy I argue that political parties have been central to trade policy in the United States, which runs contrary to the dominant demand-side explanations for trade policy. The research design I use allows me to account for a variety of different constituent factors that could influence voting, and then determine if party has any effect beyond constituent interests. The results suggest that party plays a significant role in legislative voting on trade policy once we account for constituency effects. In Tax Man Cometh (co-authored with Lissa Ziegler) we examine how a state's choice of tax policy reveals information about state capabilities. In particular, we focus on establishing the validity of a new construct for state capacity - income taxation. We argue that to measure a state's relative level of capacity we should look at the ratio of income taxes to total taxes collected by the state. We demonstrate that this is a valid measure for our construct of state capacity. In Diffusion of State Tax and Expenditure Limits Ellen Moule and I focus how state tax and expenditure limits (TELs) diffuse across the U.S. states. First, we argue that to understand policy diffusion requires paying attention to policy proposals as well as policy adoptions. Second, we separately model the determinants of exposure to a policy and then, conditional on exposure, the determinants of policy adoption. We find that proposal of a tax and expenditure limit is significantly related to whether states with similar income levels have previously adopted a TEL. Taken together these chapters help us to understand the determinants of tax policy and also what we can infer about a particular country based on its choices of tax policy",,,,,Public economics; Value-added tax; Indirect tax; Economics; Direct tax; Tax policy; Tax avoidance; Tax reform; Ad valorem tax; State income tax,,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt79s1d1fw/qt79s1d1fw.pdf https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79s1d1fw https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79s1d1fw.pdf,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79s1d1fw,,,135372752,,0,,1,false,,

What accounts for this growth in popularity? This study combines quantitative event history analysis and qualitative interview methods to try to understand why states adopted film incentive programs and how they were influenced by the adoption of incentives in other states. The analysis suggests that the diffusion processes in state adoptions of film incentives can be largely explained by two factors: (a) the size and sophistication of the existing film industry in the state and (b) a competitive “bandwagon” effect based on the total number of states that had already adopted film incentives. The results emphasize the need to broaden the ways that competitive influences can be conceptualized and modeled in policy diffusion research, especially in economic development.",31,3,255,267,Public economics; Economics; Video production; Sophistication; Microeconomics; State (polity); Popularity; Incentive; Incentive program; Bandwagon effect; Film industry,,,,,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0891242417710715 https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/ecdequ/v31y2017i3p255-267.html http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891242417710715 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891242417710715,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891242417710715,,10.1177/0891242417710715,2621089627,,0,005-692-270-875-15X; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-139-179-928-87X; 018-446-657-280-351; 019-555-885-904-049; 021-907-061-236-840; 023-236-082-357-690; 025-354-664-615-637; 027-885-859-304-797; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-071-534-198-500; 037-786-209-264-42X; 046-242-872-950-558; 046-435-142-640-946; 054-088-972-264-667; 054-180-062-257-507; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 067-490-686-317-462; 075-046-752-556-824; 081-444-248-499-833; 084-035-180-533-354; 096-362-816-439-456; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-488-954-100-242; 101-606-324-112-868; 107-184-846-378-963; 108-498-034-244-044; 113-720-938-418-161; 131-900-393-723-959; 154-314-204-508-516; 163-076-040-775-567; 173-288-487-987-301; 178-161-154-094-357,13,false,,

The results suggest that in the terms of Cardoso, Lula and Rousseff the so-called “positive” modeling (isomorphism) predominated due to the adherence of national policies to international policies focusing on the low-income population and also due to the fact that Brazilian monetary transfer policies were recently considered by the international political community as a model. On the other hand, in Lula’s second term and in Rousseff’s period there is the negative modeling identified in the linkage between economic growth policies and the increase or the maintenance of the values of social public spending.

He indicates that the Europeanization – all by itself – does not guarantee the automatic improvement of policy outcome and more effective public interventions in a given country (as a way of ensuring a higher level of capacity to generate a better proportion between resources in use and benefits). The EU’s public policy – as a policy activity initiated by the Union’s institutions – has a different structure from that of policies on the country level, as a result, it affects them in a rather selective way.

Available evidence suggests that cross-national policy diffusion is an increasingly significant phenomenon, especially in the European context. While internationalisation of policy discourses and expert communities are regarded as key driving forces of policy diffusion, public management reforms are also said to be particularly vulnerable to mechanisms of 'diffusion without convergence'. This paper analyses the case of policies aiming at reducing administrative burdens of regulations through the lens of the literature on policy diffusion. The diffusion of the so-called Standard Cost Model for measuring administrative burden between 2003 and 2007 is used as a case to explore the mechanisms facilitating policy diffusion in this domain. The analysis reveals patterns of rapid diffusion. This policy boom has been driven by a combination of different mechanisms of policy diffusion rather than by a single driving factor.",,,,,Public economics; Diffusion (business); Boom; Business; Convergence (economics); Regulatory reform; Public management; Context (language use); Internationalization,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ehl/lserod/36536.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ehl/lserod/36536.html,,,3150413212,,0,,9,false,,

The literature has hitherto entirely understood the role that pro-innovation policy entrepreneurs have played in shaping policy diffusion. Like bees distributing pollen among flowers, policy entrepreneurs are able to spread policy ideas from one state capital to another. Yet it is clear that advocates are not the only group of trans-unit actors with an agenda of their own. The inherently linked nature of units who are subject to the possibility of policy diffusion makes the generation of contrary pressure inevitable. Such pressures will be made manifest as blocking coalitions that mobilize across-unit and within-unit interest groups to block or re-shape policy innovations.",,,,,Political economy; Political science; State (polity); Blocking (linguistics); Subject (philosophy); State police; Public relations; Diffusion (acoustics); Unit (housing); Capital (economics),,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1669265,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1669265,,,2277169902,,0,001-483-398-988-341; 002-278-145-247-100; 006-291-965-631-601; 008-359-079-785-535; 009-960-743-825-27X; 010-064-046-308-429; 011-211-996-636-18X; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-307-467-921-12X; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-387-957-666-204; 021-411-765-093-703; 022-524-182-655-492; 023-843-404-656-218; 025-524-333-671-270; 029-694-779-807-168; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-115-795-883-619; 044-207-125-598-531; 047-192-204-213-556; 057-371-072-263-522; 063-149-938-949-77X; 072-983-459-398-502; 073-932-696-484-566; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-819-357-572-116; 095-179-619-530-275; 101-127-387-013-017; 105-526-785-996-251; 106-510-626-114-565; 118-513-543-976-791; 129-884-465-574-675; 135-276-413-299-358; 154-083-917-157-36X; 155-580-858-393-517; 155-777-906-832-238; 190-199-422-848-45X,0,false,,

The results suggest that states' declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal factors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and simultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political costs, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range of governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments' decisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably more likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness. We find no significant association between pandemic impact, measured as national COVID-19-related deaths, and SOEs, suggesting that many states adopted SOEs proactively before the disease spread locally.",,,,,Declaration; Business; Preparedness; Pandemic preparedness; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Development economics; Dictatorship; Democracy; Pandemic; Politics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2007.00933.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2007.00933.html,,,3160599049,,0,,0,false,,

We illustrate such dynamics by focusing on paradigm shifts between economics and legal scholarship. Our case study focuses on the evolution of the Finnish corporate tax policy between 1991 and 2014 to illuminate complex policy diffusion through professions. First, in 1993, Finnish corporate tax policy was aligned with the neoclassical ideas of the time in a lawyer-driven process. Second, in the early 2000s, initiatives from the EU and the OECD provided these lawyers a new epistemic source for broadening their argumentation. Third, in the 2010s, the disciplinary base shifted from legal studies to economics, which coincided with administrative reforms emphasizing quantitative impact assessments. These transformations completed the shift from legal scholarship to economics in tax policy design, paving way to the entrance of economic theoretical arguments to tax policy discussions. Our findings highlight five overlapping and mutually reinforcing factors that shape knowledge production in expert groups that influence economic policy: (1) the extent to which politicians rely on expertise; (2) the balance of power between academic disciplines in evidence-based policy-making; (3) the disciplinary base to which the dominant expert groups rely on; (4) the shifts in the epistemological, ontological and methodological mainstream within particular disciplines; and, (5) the extent to which international organizations are seen as epistemic versus policy-driven authorities.</jats:p>",0,0,,,Positive economics; Political science; Power (social and political); Discipline,,,,,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ael-2021-0048/html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ael-2021-0048,,10.1515/ael-2021-0048,3212052472,,0,000-107-830-657-280; 000-478-482-660-231; 001-525-589-380-251; 001-953-518-251-621; 003-044-441-061-401; 003-144-665-878-910; 003-429-198-475-192; 003-434-895-535-118; 003-465-574-483-398; 005-106-230-258-769; 006-903-210-254-187; 007-285-192-265-181; 008-281-779-637-640; 008-500-940-583-931; 009-202-769-420-120; 009-362-805-564-176; 015-081-868-584-998; 015-342-787-568-972; 016-459-343-857-912; 017-485-600-641-377; 018-596-285-692-905; 020-858-655-806-738; 021-384-613-514-299; 024-834-819-873-005; 025-115-699-326-300; 026-902-153-723-055; 027-266-369-892-511; 027-665-846-764-087; 031-227-029-543-318; 036-636-487-158-897; 047-324-902-707-90X; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-287-304-374-857; 049-097-133-571-117; 052-723-818-069-06X; 053-176-527-709-131; 055-498-815-134-39X; 057-600-038-879-08X; 060-651-120-076-081; 061-715-378-994-433; 069-258-768-440-129; 071-029-613-198-000; 073-719-229-624-379; 073-956-026-455-48X; 076-943-235-358-615; 082-319-512-965-594; 087-246-763-935-370; 089-252-999-876-913; 095-201-547-535-461; 096-595-048-395-688; 105-656-624-695-293; 114-498-725-106-748; 115-667-337-333-237; 116-042-372-403-225; 133-410-667-881-147; 133-664-850-506-177; 142-115-433-577-956; 143-788-950-098-227; 149-760-488-389-49X; 154-518-282-195-361; 157-552-764-063-124; 157-686-403-728-622; 160-275-969-680-957; 160-794-815-322-238; 162-791-900-347-666; 164-177-637-902-273; 172-767-229-038-287; 173-713-146-433-153; 184-996-681-717-686; 199-223-907-703-309,2,true,,bronze

Hence, it is concerned with processes of policy diffusion, transfer, and convergence in an international setting. Therefore, the first part of this chapter focuses on the definitions and concepts of policy diffusion, transfer, and convergence in the social sciences. It presents an overview of research undertaken on mechanisms and exogenous factors of policy diffusion, such as policy networks and epistemic communities; norms, legitimacy, and opinion leadership as well as policy learning. Adjacent to this, domestic and policy specific factors, which are generally believed to influence processes of policy diffusion and convergence, are discussed as well as the methods applied in policy diffusion and convergence studies. This provides general background information on research strategies and methods in the field of policy diffusion and convergence research as well as lays the groundwork for discussions on research methodology, which will be seen in later chapters. The overview of relevant studies exclusively focuses on research with regard to diffusion, policy transfer, and convergence in relation to our research question, thus, only on voluntary policy transfer.",,,26,56,Positive economics; Opinion leadership; Economics; Policy transfer; Higher education policy; Research question; Bologna Process; Convergence (relationship); Field (Bourdieu); Legitimacy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137412799_3 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137412799_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9781137412799_3,,10.1057/9781137412799_3,2478266254,,0,,1,false,,

Repeated policy mistakes continue to be the hallmark in both developed and developing worlds, even though policy failures present valuable and multiple opportunities for policy learning, especially in Africa. With high-profile policy failures in Africa, we expect that learning lessons from such failures will be paramount to policymakers. Unfortunately, this is hardly the case. Focusing on the recent electricity privatization fiasco in Ghana, this chapter examines factors that impede or affect policymakers’ ability to learn from previous policy failures.

Norms do not simply standardize state behaviors, as is conventionally argued; norms also draw on and set up hierarchical social orders among states. Through a conceptual rethinking we gain a better understanding of where—among which states—new policies may first emerge: social hierarchies create incentives for new policies to develop at the margins of international society so that policies may diffuse “from below.” We also get a better grasp of how policy advocates frame the appropriateness or benefits of a new state practice: they must frame policy demands in terms of the international standing and rank of the targeted state. This article's empirical aspiration is to use these insights to help account for the international policy diffusion of legal sex quotas, a policy to increase the level of female legislators that developed first among “developing” states rather than among the so-called core of international society. By pointing to the link between norms and social hierarchy, the article helps account for policy diffusion “from below.”",66,2,179,209,Public economics; Rank (computer programming); Sociology; Set (psychology); Law and economics; Core (game theory); As is; Policy studies; State (polity); Incentive; Social stratification,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:cup:intorg:v:66:y:2012:i:02:p:179-209_00 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:542608 http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0020818312000045 https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0020818312000045 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/intorg/v66y2012i02p179-209_00.html https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/abs/norms-and-social-hierarchies-understanding-international-policy-diffusion-from-below/4F946748BFFA55752D3E41FC77B091FF,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0020818312000045,,10.1017/s0020818312000045,2049670036,,0,000-000-067-586-545; 006-687-331-682-141; 010-070-285-257-789; 010-297-483-353-575; 011-628-302-120-263; 011-878-113-759-764; 014-093-996-306-038; 014-185-853-137-888; 014-210-087-836-226; 014-613-310-264-571; 015-493-854-028-078; 016-634-173-735-220; 017-544-656-763-653; 018-671-194-664-113; 020-286-076-349-05X; 020-780-286-452-251; 022-182-427-311-966; 022-707-841-212-372; 026-412-549-797-331; 027-952-834-053-159; 029-662-267-745-411; 034-457-847-129-453; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-972-369-607-308; 046-786-209-513-584; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-146-132-370-77X; 048-334-834-091-159; 050-274-654-059-514; 055-651-898-969-47X; 059-196-776-082-524; 063-149-938-949-77X; 063-400-296-712-427; 063-866-775-704-699; 065-437-707-836-179; 065-666-299-776-558; 071-846-033-952-37X; 073-270-682-356-889; 081-665-824-228-572; 084-001-465-924-433; 085-104-142-780-576; 087-829-694-698-678; 088-061-233-086-194; 093-190-746-631-057; 107-591-146-740-86X; 115-805-102-140-994; 116-222-257-785-019; 117-677-347-760-402; 123-021-620-982-117; 123-869-753-143-999; 124-400-115-398-75X; 125-268-617-755-543; 125-811-373-861-551; 128-471-901-063-256; 132-314-232-662-897; 139-186-190-548-754; 140-276-797-012-993; 143-902-868-638-526; 144-332-009-854-751; 144-581-628-836-293; 144-866-694-365-572; 145-018-258-463-066; 145-455-147-463-501; 146-052-956-923-168; 146-773-773-756-862; 159-833-192-012-500; 160-970-696-779-63X; 161-383-228-720-768; 161-875-182-947-019; 168-998-352-216-177; 170-686-336-981-775; 173-567-809-531-297; 176-059-238-882-699; 179-423-863-980-558; 180-611-084-058-488; 188-035-998-584-503; 193-498-707-588-937; 197-161-567-794-254,156,false,,

Questions addressed in this framework include: to what extent is policy diffusion or convergence a real and relevant phenomenon? What role have economists played in the transfer of policy across national domains? Has policy transfer led to 'better' public policy?

Stoutenborough; R. Matthew Beverlin,"Previous research has failed to adequately address why we should expect the diffusion of policy innovations in the realm of gun policy. As a social regulatory policy, gun policy may be highly influenced by policy adoptions in neighboring regions, in part due to the high likelihood of spillover effects. This article discusses under what conditions we should expect policy diffusion to occur from neighboring jurisdictions. We use event-history analyses to evaluate impact of neighboring states diffusion pressure on the adoption of “shall issue” concealed weapons laws between 1974 and 2007. Neighboring diffusion pressure has a significant effect on policy adoption even when controlling for National Rifle Association membership and a previous adoption of a similar policy (“may issue” permit). We provide a rationale why scholars should find neighboring diffusion effects in some policy areas but not others.; ; Related Articles; ; Cagel, Christine, and J.

Este estudio analiza bajo que condiciones deberiamos esperar la difusion de politicas en jurisdicciones adyacentes. Usamos un Analisis de Eventos Historicos para evaluar el impacto de la presion en la difusion de estados adyacentes en la adopcion de politicas “Shall Issue” para armas encubiertas entre 1974 y 2007. La presion en la difusion de estados contiguos tiene un efecto significativo en la adopcion de regulaciones aun cuando se controla por membresia en la NRA y previas adopciones de politicas similares (permisos “May Issue”).

For TNCs, however, weak rule of law, poor governance capacity, corruption and gaps in appropriate legislation in developing countries have made the management, enforcement and monitoring of local labour practices problematic, in the process exposing TNCs to reputational risks and potential commercial harm. TNCs have attempted to overcome these constraints by developing corporate responsibility (CR) strategies designed to set in place codes of ethical conduct in the treatment of worker rights while protecting shareholder interests and those of other stakeholders. As this paper explores, TNCs are pursuing the development of regulatory codes that are required to be adopted by their supply chain partners, in the process, setting standards that are diffused to local businesses and organizations and impacting the regulatory structures that govern local business beha...",6,2,147,162,Supply chain; Shareholder; Ethical code; Corporate social responsibility; Economics; Corruption; Legislation; Enforcement; Corporate governance; Industrial organization; Economic system,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17516234.2013.814307,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17516234.2013.814307,,10.1080/17516234.2013.814307,2003758482,,0,012-124-291-688-837; 013-467-599-588-26X; 013-746-342-165-992; 014-921-846-851-816; 019-356-049-718-88X; 022-488-008-778-264; 024-975-992-224-788; 029-822-700-560-873; 032-004-804-982-855; 032-130-020-175-075; 037-756-906-468-826; 041-553-785-665-835; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-364-835-360-071; 048-846-133-812-979; 074-153-068-498-514; 075-458-878-984-198; 077-056-509-409-244; 079-329-675-640-517; 085-104-142-780-576; 085-161-458-641-290; 085-384-248-408-931; 099-327-216-453-495; 101-763-724-284-406; 105-970-790-011-497; 108-568-941-505-309; 110-502-326-347-134; 112-649-849-118-807; 113-741-307-551-153; 118-524-037-061-234; 135-863-274-430-438; 139-542-801-581-798; 141-678-543-219-132; 146-039-598-976-852; 151-480-938-801-505; 156-444-282-694-340; 157-470-127-263-343; 195-918-717-404-784,3,false,,

One of the key actors tasked with implementing this shift in Chinese foreign policy is the International Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP-ID). The CCP-ID maintains the kind of collaborative network that is hypothesized to be a channel of policy diffusion and learning. Offering a first exploration of this under-researched aspect of China’s foreign policy, this chapter systematically compares the activities of the CCP-ID in five of China’s close neighbors to better understand the patterns of interaction and, even more importantly, the topics and content of engagement. Party-to-party relations are used for both promoting China’s foreign policy interests as well as diffusing authoritarian practices.

Cases are developed from secondary data from the European Union and South America, and analyzed at the national and regional levels.Findings – The results suggest: the expected utility model can be used for in‐depth qualitative analyses to compare effects of various diffusion mechanisms; diffusion of spectrum license allocation policies at the regional level was more strongly driven by a policy's likely effectiveness, as compared to potential payoffs for policymakers; and conversely, at the national level diffusion was driven by both payoffs for the policymakers and likely policy effectiveness.Originality/value – The two academic co...",15,4,23,42,Public economics; Diffusion (business); Economics; Common value auction; Expected utility hypothesis; Value (economics); Comparative case; License; European union; Regionalism (international relations),,,,,https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/intra-regional-diffusion-of-spectrum-license-allocation-policies https://research.cbs.dk/en/publications/intra-regional-diffusion-of-spectrum-license-allocation-policies https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/info-06-2012-0028/full/html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/info-06-2012-0028,,10.1108/info-06-2012-0028,2084115570,,0,006-040-995-257-407; 006-722-686-316-360; 010-471-596-800-248; 015-271-876-692-523; 020-416-723-386-926; 026-412-549-797-331; 033-710-050-865-648; 034-678-688-772-765; 040-595-354-760-469; 043-156-384-470-205; 044-808-772-124-045; 045-911-402-492-651; 048-025-938-497-701; 048-413-313-313-364; 052-942-563-329-578; 057-404-748-273-893; 064-819-427-648-314; 071-050-363-418-651; 071-638-120-070-563; 078-058-882-264-069; 080-532-167-774-104; 080-906-281-956-263; 083-629-464-861-706; 084-994-279-048-23X; 085-803-157-389-927; 087-708-994-727-441; 088-993-237-313-315; 090-874-669-983-03X; 094-833-126-001-305; 096-068-990-918-359; 097-747-388-225-921; 112-785-526-672-367; 115-667-337-333-237; 116-222-257-785-019; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-201-330-083-030; 118-513-543-976-791; 142-134-866-781-796; 145-047-319-889-865; 156-979-562-286-756; 197-283-079-229-577,1,false,,

This article investigates it in the area of higher education and research. Specifically it explores what types of intergovernmental regional alliances exist and to what extent their member countries coordinate their higher education and research policies. The article focuses on six most prominent and most formalized intergovernmental regional alliances: the Benelux, Norden–The Nordic Cooperation, the Visegrad Group, the Franco-German Cooperation, the Western Balkans, and the Baltic Cooperation. There has been much research devoted to study of policy diffusion from the European to the national level, but the intergovernmental regional level has largely been ignored. This article argues that there clearly exists a multi-level governance system in the area of higher education and research, in which regional intergovernmental alliances also perform policy coordination. Therefore, the politics of European higher education policy-making cannot be fully understood by ignoring intergovernmental regional cooperation.",13,,75,90,Higher education; Regional science; Political science; European integration; European union; Governance system; National level; Economic system; Politics,,,,,https://ir.lib.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/files/public/3/39941/20160511150052989315/HigherEducationForum_13_75.pdf https://ir.lib.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/00039941,https://ir.lib.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/00039941,,,2377000933,,0,016-654-356-289-09X; 022-140-704-449-379; 030-624-820-145-402; 051-394-170-294-270; 052-201-386-466-679; 104-634-883-153-76X; 114-492-613-915-383; 117-579-776-662-318; 125-250-074-132-968; 166-379-333-924-439,1,false,,

During this debate, the role of neighborhood structure is ignored and the linear assumption is still prevailing in this field. By analyzing the spatial convergence of local vocational education development with data of 31 provinces from 1995 to 2008 in China, we explore the effects of neighborhood interactions on policy diffusion, paying specific attention to the dynamical role of neighborhood structures in policy diffusion. The empirical results clearly indicate that the development of local vocational education systems in China is spatially autocorrelated to the neighboring provinces. Local vocational education systems converge more slowly if a spatially lagged dependent variable is introduced, while they converge faster if a spatially error variable is introduced. The policy transition between neighbors considering their local spatial context is analyzed with Spatial Markov Chain and a fundamental nonlinear connection between neighborhood structure and policy transition is unveiled. Using spatial econometric models, we also find that the socio-spatial diffusion patterns with the social factors such as consumption, urban/rural distribution and occupation serve as barriers to and amplifiers of policy diffusion. These results not only resonate with conventional linear wisdom on policy diffusion but also offer a new nonlinear perspective on socio-spatial patterns of policy diffusion that are clearly embedded within the local neighborhood structures.",9,4,503,527,Field (geography); Econometrics; Actuarial science; Economics; Econometric model; Variable (computer science); Social policy; Variables; Spatial contextual awareness; Vocational education; Markov chain,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12061-015-9161-3 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12061-015-9161-3/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12061-015-9161-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12061-015-9161-3,,10.1007/s12061-015-9161-3,1919318255,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 002-557-636-257-591; 003-913-373-315-060; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-722-686-316-360; 007-748-315-099-75X; 008-673-160-534-528; 011-384-034-647-836; 011-771-866-920-743; 012-488-040-289-847; 012-663-341-857-233; 015-610-010-080-378; 016-088-247-599-087; 017-727-918-433-833; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-303-532-604-20X; 019-456-406-334-322; 031-485-856-043-239; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-654-941-293-483; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-689-436-224-80X; 038-977-651-430-484; 040-058-016-041-863; 043-263-348-391-626; 045-493-688-472-023; 046-249-958-968-523; 052-723-818-069-06X; 054-213-760-795-853; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-584-207-510-275; 061-193-261-068-713; 062-216-791-900-074; 063-221-502-449-348; 063-674-247-980-220; 064-195-431-156-58X; 066-930-859-791-470; 068-360-996-133-651; 069-497-450-159-757; 070-439-295-045-214; 071-749-566-147-475; 073-796-412-498-509; 074-465-905-471-400; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-707-335-823-68X; 079-705-757-170-703; 083-128-427-871-272; 086-251-680-309-120; 086-790-883-065-886; 088-665-707-744-409; 088-919-425-365-248; 093-976-962-761-459; 098-317-151-036-205; 098-797-818-793-198; 098-820-290-201-352; 099-038-566-001-404; 100-293-429-665-492; 101-488-954-100-242; 104-723-571-720-248; 104-901-609-598-794; 105-526-785-996-251; 109-738-185-922-179; 109-894-490-412-567; 111-382-728-177-513; 117-530-616-284-840; 123-364-270-825-879; 125-160-904-901-422; 125-389-923-726-944; 127-826-672-055-220; 128-059-894-084-213; 129-038-185-433-517; 129-835-100-386-865; 136-993-141-215-111; 146-930-137-681-800; 156-795-231-003-743; 163-637-734-144-951; 184-398-489-686-146; 185-020-775-542-401; 190-032-990-340-879; 193-747-337-870-621; 196-657-219-692-027,8,false,,

Fernández,"Previous quantitative research regarding the long expansionary era of public pension generosity has relied mainly on aggregate expenditure data, which capture many pension policy dimensions. Yet, the overall level of national pension generosity may differ from the generosity of each important dimension. To improve our understanding of public pension reforms that increase generosity levels, this study examines the introduction of automatic indexation clauses between 1945 and 2000. The paper tests predictions of welfare policy development and policy diffusion theories. Using event history methods, we argue that the inflation rate and the incumbency of Christian democratic parties are the main determinants of these policy reforms. Countries with higher inflation rates and more entrenched Christian democratic parties are more likely to link pensions in payment or past wages considered for initial calculation purposes to an economic index. This suggests that political parties differ in their support for each m...",22,3,241,258,Welfare; Economic policy; Macroeconomics; Payment; Economics; Aggregate expenditure; National Pension; Generosity; Pension; Index (economics); Inflation,,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0958928712440202 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0958928712440202,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958928712440202,,10.1177/0958928712440202,2163180350,,0,000-267-571-130-101; 000-312-266-787-641; 005-249-461-623-469; 010-278-292-671-040; 010-799-255-458-56X; 015-903-137-707-528; 018-704-306-862-543; 021-216-291-636-927; 021-597-338-010-764; 025-051-259-109-409; 025-316-114-842-053; 030-795-850-532-258; 033-305-493-654-349; 033-776-139-556-560; 033-852-662-613-736; 033-968-043-816-272; 045-907-983-791-403; 046-696-596-592-796; 047-596-095-984-909; 051-856-408-196-595; 052-239-264-004-066; 052-689-970-257-392; 056-529-789-544-234; 057-423-413-457-280; 058-057-824-033-203; 059-510-230-546-465; 059-544-440-222-544; 061-373-791-267-531; 062-639-381-292-875; 067-638-210-361-255; 070-439-295-045-214; 070-680-563-468-063; 071-846-033-952-37X; 072-839-611-781-72X; 073-123-674-530-568; 073-674-139-091-154; 077-908-763-431-030; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 084-370-283-025-895; 084-626-039-494-32X; 084-955-214-792-816; 090-434-568-862-504; 091-190-574-697-750; 093-190-746-631-057; 093-571-185-000-798; 095-954-927-968-724; 100-057-464-912-546; 101-869-775-592-412; 105-295-046-369-750; 114-285-637-300-568; 118-688-159-697-776; 121-520-493-351-50X; 127-065-762-105-566; 131-695-854-835-567; 131-900-393-723-959; 132-433-110-054-676; 134-360-829-772-124; 139-438-510-576-868; 142-445-750-138-094; 148-549-604-619-409; 154-314-204-508-516; 163-129-691-355-060; 163-870-430-410-481; 163-926-847-617-824; 163-941-214-257-860; 167-293-860-038-374; 169-669-598-978-20X; 169-899-210-770-140; 180-523-169-778-206; 185-664-190-350-82X; 188-099-675-686-380; 189-362-501-455-517; 192-789-033-769-590; 193-383-211-728-043; 195-225-514-896-027; 199-757-040-081-362,7,false,,

Through the lens of the policy-diffusion literature, this article examines the reform processes in Arizona and Illinois, two representatives of the handful of states that were late in innovating, in order to test for effects of HAVA on state decision making. These “late-to-innovate” states were unique compared with the preponderance of other states that innovated earlier. Typical internal variables explained why Arizona and Illinois fell into gridlock over election reform initially, but we must turn to other (external) explanations to understand the ultimate decisions to innovate. Also, although they are similar in being late to innovate, these two states display interesting differences as well.

As we know from international comparative cultural research, however, there are different pathways into modernity, and so the particular role of education for a nation-state’s cultural basis might differ as well. At the same time, different relations between countries, such as cultural similarity or trade, can function as channels of diffusion of welfare policies.

The article claims that, while socioeconomic factors such as globalization and economic crises and international factors such as policy diffusion were important catalysts for neoliberal institutional change, the political resources of and power relations between market-oriented reformers and nonmarket coordination-oriented anti-reformers affected regulatory reform processes and decided their characteristics. In the labor market reform, the government of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) promoted deregulation by establishing cabinet committees, whose members acted as neoliberal policy entrepreneurs by representing employers’ interests. In the financial regulatory reform, LDP senior members and financial bureaucrats resisted reform as veto players by informally coordinating with the financial sector. However, market-oriented reforms were eventually introduced by LDP and opposition reformers, whose policy entrepreneurship was crucial to market-oriented institutional change.; ; ; ; この論文は、なぜ日本の政府が、異なる政治過程を経たにもかかわらず、結果的に労働市場および金融市場の規制改革において、市場メカニズムを拡大導入したかを分析する。グローバル化や経済危機などの社会経済的要因や政策普及などの国際的要因が、新自由主義的な制度変化を引き起こす重要な要因でありうる一方で、市場志向の改革者と非市場的な手段による調整志向の市場改革反対者の政治的資源および力関係が、規制改革の過程に影響を及ぼし、その性格を決定づけたことを主張する。労働市場改革においては、経営者の利益を代表する新自由主義的な政策企業家を委員とする内閣会議を設立することにより、自民党政権は規制緩和を促進した。他方、金融市場改革においては、金融部門と非公式に利害調整することにより、自民党の年配議員と金融官僚は、拒否権をつうじて改革に抵抗した。しかし、市場志向の改革が、そのような改革に不可欠な政策企業家マインドを有する自民党と野党の改革派によって、最終的に導入された。",7,3,413,432,Neoliberalism; Economics; Financial market; Regulatory reform; Institutional change; Market economy,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aspp.12200 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aspp.12200/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aspp.12200,,10.1111/aspp.12200,2125912483,,0,017-397-981-692-898; 017-978-262-796-901; 025-346-349-322-033; 032-741-151-717-228; 047-762-407-191-686; 055-026-537-963-693; 060-188-343-841-105; 070-388-925-370-912; 072-053-591-379-922; 074-488-959-899-703; 078-150-128-753-794; 079-751-874-722-05X; 084-370-283-025-895; 085-635-171-856-181; 085-772-887-870-887; 087-663-486-169-272; 089-160-322-471-027; 092-328-337-680-723; 095-484-603-028-775; 099-054-040-390-935; 103-492-310-053-641; 109-292-035-534-492; 116-672-218-645-089; 117-117-152-471-55X; 148-149-171-922-847; 165-596-578-665-003; 174-398-316-578-830; 176-187-310-033-605; 184-996-681-717-686; 186-717-524-649-219; 195-459-088-993-271,3,false,,

The study explores the arguments for compulsory school closure and reopening decisions due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the related framing of risk and harms to children and society. Three welfare-state jurisdictions (Finland, Sweden and Ontario, Canada) are compared at the point where decisions over lockdowns were first made and at the point when students arrived from their summer break in 2020. Method. The rationales for school closures were explored through a comparative analysis using the 3I+E framework to identify the institutional arrangements, interests and ideas that were salient to these decisions. In addition, an analytic framework borrowed from the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) was used to explore how different voices were heard or not heard during the debate in each jurisdiction. Conclusions. The arguments for and against school closures were constantly renegotiated within each jurisdiction, leading to different decisions. A mix of institutional factors, such as existing legislation, a limited but increasing evidence base, policy diffusion and societal values, explains the differences in lockdown and reopening decisions across jurisdictions and whose voices ‘counted’. Ultimately, the decisions reflected different ideas about safety and what physical locations in society were deemed ‘safer’ for children during the pandemic.",,,169,203,Framing (construction); Jurisdiction; Political science; Legislation; Pandemic; Welfare; Public administration; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Law; Geography; Medicine; Disease; Archaeology; Pathology; Infectious disease (medical specialty),,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003241157-13,,10.4324/9781003241157-13,,,0,,0,false,,

Activation policies for young people in Denmark and the UK",2004-04-15,2004,journal article,International Journal of Social Welfare,13696866; 14682397,Wiley,United Kingdom,Colin Lindsay; Mikkel Mailand,"This article analyses and compares the development of activation policies for young people in Denmark and the UK from the mid-1990s. Despite their diverse welfare traditions and important differences in the organisation and delivery of benefits and services for the unemployed, both countries have recently introduced large-scale compulsory activation programmes for young people. These programmes share a number of common features, especially a combination of strong compulsion and an apparently contradictory emphasis on client-centred training and support for participants. The suggested transition from the ‘Keynesian welfare state’ to the ‘Schumpeterian workfare regime’ is used as a framework to discuss the two countries’ recent moves towards activation. It is argued that while this framework is useful in explaining the general shift towards active labour-market policies in Europe, it alone cannot account for the particular convergence of the Danish and British policies in the specific area of youth activation. Rather, a number of specific political factors explaining the development of policies in the mid-1990s are suggested. The article concludes that concerns about mass youth unemployment, the influence of the ‘dependency culture’ debate in various forms, cross-national policy diffusion and, crucially, the progressive re-engineering of compulsory activation by strong centre-left governments have all contributed to the emergence of policies that mix compulsion and a commitment to the centrality of work with a ‘client-centred approach’ that seeks to balance more effective job seeking with human resource development. However, attempts to combine the apparently contradictory concepts of ‘client-centredness’ and compulsion are likely to prove politically fragile, and both countries risk lurching towards an increasingly workfarist approach.",13,3,195,207,Welfare; Human resources; Welfare state; Economics; Convergence (economics); Unemployment; Workfare; Youth unemployment; Development economics; Economic growth; Politics,,,,,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/39413/ https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/39413/1/ijsw_FINAL.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2397.00069-i1 https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/files/12251003/ijsw_FINAL.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2397.00069-i1/abstract https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/different-routes-common-directions-activation-policies-for-young- https://core.ac.uk/download/9039615.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-2397.00069-i1,,10.1111/1468-2397.00069-i1,2118311128,,0,001-887-827-027-727; 002-552-975-744-922; 003-939-943-754-74X; 008-463-673-681-771; 009-834-414-690-67X; 009-884-238-080-244; 011-197-848-281-091; 021-003-750-254-401; 023-289-160-636-986; 023-396-284-308-128; 026-321-344-269-240; 026-643-358-887-869; 028-634-339-174-837; 030-256-375-056-80X; 032-702-427-845-684; 037-416-538-826-042; 038-227-126-293-327; 039-400-584-474-195; 041-461-503-217-295; 041-691-467-236-125; 042-037-029-010-492; 043-107-084-984-991; 049-618-792-437-473; 051-342-760-410-388; 055-069-493-924-333; 070-844-084-548-945; 072-000-701-385-129; 077-448-166-094-254; 077-514-552-995-037; 085-781-934-179-605; 091-924-822-286-177; 095-421-061-786-644; 101-891-747-222-597; 104-254-759-097-751; 109-592-709-487-683; 117-677-347-760-402; 127-220-108-018-000; 133-799-338-890-876; 138-781-307-475-043; 149-062-974-662-406; 155-802-154-019-86X; 159-758-763-848-057; 175-477-459-133-371; 176-744-896-051-518; 180-063-547-319-329; 188-833-146-945-483; 191-360-237-527-317; 195-269-139-186-377,38,true,,green

One of its biggest achievement happened in 13 December 2001 when the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the ABM treaty, a bilateral agreement with the Soviet Union. The U.S. involvement in ABM Treaty was thought by the Heritage Foundation as an obstacle to make a strong national security. Therefore, it worked to influence the U.S. withdrawal. Heritage Foundation might not be the only one actor that involved in this issue, but this thesis will specifically discuss about the role of The Heritage Foundation. As an advocacy think tank, the Heritage Foundation has four different functions: (1) producing original idea and policy recommendation, (2) providing an expertise, (3) involving in any discussion or debate, and (4) educating civil society and decision makers about current issues. Furthermore, as the embodiment of epistemic community, the Heritage Foundation has four influence mechanism: policy innovation, policy diffusion, policy selection, and policy persistence. These functions and mechanism are the keys of Heritage Foundation’s successfullness in preserving its influnce in American politics. Keywords: American politics, think tank, ABM Treaty, ballistic missile",,,,,Decision-making; Political science; Obstacle; Epistemic community; Treaty; Foundation (evidence); Public administration; Civil society; Politics of the United States; National security,,,,,http://etd.repository.ugm.ac.id/penelitian/detail/124338,http://etd.repository.ugm.ac.id/penelitian/detail/124338,,,3201662133,,0,,0,false,,

Our two experiments–embedded in national surveys of U.S. municipal officials–expose local policymakers to vignettes describing the zoning and home foreclosure policies of other cities, offering opportunities to learn more. We find that: (1) policymakers who are ideologically predisposed against the described policy are relatively unwilling to learn from others, but (2) such ideological biases can be overcome with an emphasis on the policy's success or on its adoption by co-partisans in other communities. We also find a similar partisan-based bias among traditional ideological supporters, who are less willing to learn from those in the opposing party. The experimental approach offered here provides numerous new opportunities for scholars of policy diffusion.",61,1,37,49,Ideology; Political science; Order (exchange); Foreclosure; Policy learning; Public relations; Zoning; Politics,,,,Yale University,https://myweb.uiowa.edu/fboehmke/shambaugh2014/papers/BVDSDiffExper140304.pdf http://adamdynes.com/documents/0PUB_2015_AJPS_bvds_diffusion-experiment.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/amposc/v61y2017i1p37-49.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12213,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12213,,10.1111/ajps.12213,3125037047,,0,000-705-019-742-830; 001-328-701-270-077; 001-481-906-279-295; 001-884-957-527-849; 005-692-270-875-15X; 012-286-853-432-764; 015-475-547-173-305; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-456-406-334-322; 019-520-082-731-674; 023-672-511-213-267; 026-441-553-340-687; 030-843-276-160-798; 033-085-475-899-252; 033-969-989-312-301; 034-657-800-561-085; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-818-459-512-182; 039-318-000-420-191; 044-958-408-877-837; 047-374-689-657-733; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-490-686-317-462; 072-116-040-237-640; 072-917-200-599-377; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-283-256-886-511; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-787-681-556-687; 096-460-127-598-75X; 098-353-841-797-309; 102-730-017-263-708; 105-349-901-848-551; 105-526-785-996-251; 112-333-966-495-520; 120-035-135-153-321; 120-139-197-621-051; 120-911-773-457-984; 127-807-528-981-832; 133-593-649-746-974; 143-401-886-825-354; 143-636-755-199-126; 144-230-954-815-59X; 155-580-858-393-517; 167-703-498-904-653; 179-503-601-354-258; 181-055-494-377-643; 182-753-753-973-744,105,false,,

Muir Macpherson,"We argue that the global spread of ideas contributes to trade liberalization. Building on insights from a rich case-based literature, we suggest an explicit mechanism of trade policy diffusion: US-trained Ph.D. economists, who share a common belief in the benefits of free trade, and who operate with varying degrees of political influence around the world. We offer the first cross-national test of the impact of economists on trade liberalization using a unique dataset recording the country of residence of all 6,493 foreign-based, US-trained American Economic Association (AEA) members over the period 1981–1997. Specifically, we measure the influence of economists on the timing and extent of trade liberalization. First, we endogenize the date of trade liberalization using hazard and probit models. Controlling for alternative diffusion mechanisms and other confounding variables, our results suggest that economists significantly speed up the reform process. Second, we find that countries with greater numbers o...",38,5,670,702,Commercial policy; Economics; Trade barrier; International economics; Residence; International political economy; Free trade; Probit model; Gravity model of trade; Politics,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03050629.2012.726185 https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/ginixx/v38y2012i5p670-702.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03050629.2012.726185,,10.1080/03050629.2012.726185,2127216277,,0,000-914-644-435-765; 001-953-485-766-185; 002-369-960-494-291; 003-591-923-103-54X; 005-249-461-623-469; 008-927-986-295-575; 009-285-222-350-903; 012-519-862-465-896; 014-955-833-872-445; 015-081-868-584-998; 015-348-486-636-254; 018-596-285-692-905; 019-454-920-846-524; 021-216-291-636-927; 032-338-481-743-680; 033-371-383-723-679; 034-277-783-905-290; 034-340-327-894-320; 036-635-664-099-740; 037-599-622-759-06X; 039-318-000-420-191; 042-428-421-626-425; 045-116-230-207-101; 046-343-943-091-694; 047-444-427-544-414; 051-462-440-102-200; 053-495-849-310-957; 054-880-134-792-240; 062-183-017-874-921; 062-838-107-819-701; 063-136-292-013-434; 063-400-296-712-427; 065-666-299-776-558; 067-121-006-432-261; 068-307-819-107-863; 069-909-494-409-568; 076-059-834-724-990; 076-851-468-860-624; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 079-239-338-482-723; 081-118-035-104-953; 083-128-427-871-272; 089-217-512-279-903; 089-594-336-460-79X; 093-809-804-637-585; 095-891-533-119-505; 096-556-976-531-193; 097-124-778-102-299; 098-722-879-915-957; 100-163-433-823-064; 101-355-735-818-191; 105-526-785-996-251; 105-574-915-830-185; 109-204-214-997-350; 113-070-327-876-41X; 114-357-514-662-948; 117-497-428-542-089; 118-767-489-920-542; 124-231-648-945-125; 127-826-672-055-220; 131-076-765-815-326; 133-410-667-881-147; 135-784-705-189-485; 137-396-514-389-239; 139-186-190-548-754; 148-832-222-160-771; 150-182-909-511-259; 152-377-695-077-540; 162-791-900-347-666; 179-316-265-816-834; 182-254-538-808-600; 190-032-990-340-879; 197-541-268-876-350,13,false,,

Using an original dataset of domestic violence firearm law (DVFL) enactments across all 50 states in the United States from 1990 to 2017, we analyze the circumstances under which states will adopt these laws. Using a set of political and demographic indicators as independent variables, we find evidence that state and federal factors influence policy adoption. In particular, the number of gun-related homicides, partisan control of the legislature, citizen ideology, federal policy, and election years each influence the likelihood of DVFL enactments. We find support for the effects of vertical policy diffusion on initial enactment of federal laws in this domain, but not for reauthorizations, which raises important questions about the continuous influence of the federal government on state policies.</jats:p>",22,3,247,269,Federalism; Legislature; State (computer science); Context (archaeology); Political science; Gun control; Politics; Law; Ideology; Geography; Archaeology; Algorithm; Computer science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/spq.2021.35,,10.1017/spq.2021.35,,,0,000-984-252-735-244; 004-491-271-856-578; 015-537-313-539-117; 018-454-798-334-448; 023-236-082-357-690; 023-672-511-213-267; 027-755-123-010-248; 031-349-458-874-807; 033-803-034-935-477; 035-717-322-252-568; 042-871-835-852-197; 058-071-798-060-611; 062-849-708-836-500; 067-490-686-317-462; 070-219-275-932-09X; 070-439-295-045-214; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-567-896-925-365; 080-334-065-154-492; 081-110-501-496-442; 085-301-057-452-781; 085-932-299-934-530; 086-390-934-065-868; 088-040-702-697-885; 088-919-425-365-248; 095-867-789-875-435; 100-769-412-118-477; 101-127-387-013-017; 105-256-808-682-742; 107-580-847-647-760; 123-979-634-628-851; 135-362-600-877-716; 137-649-972-432-09X; 146-112-099-512-090; 150-204-113-752-078; 156-233-844-421-468,1,true,,hybrid

Despite the relatively large number of publications, however, little attention has been paid to the important question of why a policy is differently implemented or diffused across governments. To answer this question and improve our understanding of local policy choice beyond widely cited neighboring influences, we closely examine the roles of three main policy actors—internal actors, external actors, and go-betweens—in the local policy diffusion process, drawing particularly upon property tax reassessment scenarios. In addition, we focus on nested institutional arrangements, including form of government and type of property tax assessor, that affect the policy decisions of internal actors. Using data on cities and towns in New York State for 1993-2010, we estimate event history models of property tax reassessment activities. Our findings reveal that regional interactions with neighbors that have already adopted the policy and top-down go-betweens through positive inducements can help facilitate property tax reassessment across municipalities. Reformed municipal governments in the council-manager form, along with appointed assessors, are also most likely to adopt reassessment policy frequently, compared with other institutional arrangements. Overall, this study advances the policy diffusion literature by exploring the roles of different influences through a more detailed, broader approach",47,5,599,614,Public economics; Government; Economics; State (polity); Property tax; Event history; Local policy; Policy decision,,,,,https://yonsei.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/moving-beyond-the-influence-of-neighbors-on-policy-diffusion-loca https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6062709 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0275074017706754 https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10220/42822 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0275074017706754 https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/82594/1/Moving%20beyond%20the%20Influence%20of%20Neighbors%20on%20Policy%20Diffusion_Local%20Influences%20on%20Decisions%20to%20Conduct%20Property%20Tax%20Reassessment%20in%20New%20York.pdf http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0275074017706754,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0275074017706754,,10.1177/0275074017706754,2627006302,,0,002-329-854-148-284; 005-135-400-747-139; 006-722-686-316-360; 007-939-690-189-695; 010-426-290-499-226; 012-583-204-181-329; 015-591-021-271-179; 017-711-086-512-953; 018-066-243-512-381; 018-454-798-334-448; 023-672-511-213-267; 024-814-511-741-411; 025-361-193-677-094; 027-272-349-563-922; 027-827-119-143-849; 027-953-152-555-615; 028-823-867-475-409; 030-957-645-303-236; 031-441-852-579-496; 033-353-979-086-27X; 036-961-749-635-681; 044-958-408-877-837; 047-350-687-161-682; 053-591-220-723-930; 053-779-982-866-983; 054-941-369-670-99X; 056-077-059-538-567; 056-609-522-226-43X; 058-477-331-036-546; 063-870-304-566-930; 063-933-073-180-584; 065-323-929-523-762; 065-641-307-304-315; 067-490-686-317-462; 073-187-357-658-640; 074-350-952-735-325; 075-395-252-775-989; 076-240-693-922-091; 080-285-338-290-10X; 083-425-992-938-039; 084-787-681-556-687; 085-856-771-600-680; 091-963-542-755-516; 094-682-121-532-97X; 096-517-829-236-651; 096-548-920-809-272; 096-961-374-436-358; 097-853-976-139-789; 101-127-387-013-017; 107-605-926-265-849; 110-888-566-554-313; 115-482-499-323-938; 121-051-331-943-706; 128-955-543-483-090; 134-601-172-231-765; 138-952-173-018-704; 144-181-950-058-538; 148-088-452-146-091; 158-466-521-610-723; 164-486-455-826-870; 169-306-578-492-736; 183-733-805-068-155; 188-418-846-270-802,6,true,,green

A two-level analysis of transnational interactions and domestic law making shows how Communist Party prerogatives shape the insertion of multilateral norms into the legal system. In a contentious process of local accommodation, transnationally engaged technocratic bodies, turf-conscious bureaucracies, and powerful party organs struggle to reconcile the goals of promoting global economic expansion, gaining international recognition, and absorbing innovative regulatory tools while preserving tight domestic control. In effect, Chinese policymakers try to utilize policy diffusion as a mechanism for negotiating and promoting the nation's global rise. Yet, when it comes to implementation, global regulatory standards are weakened or even neutralized through discretionary enforcement. The depth and robustness of normative assimilation therefore remain uncertain.",24,4,639,664,Political economy; Economics; Technocracy; Negotiation; Enforcement; Money laundering; Economic expansion; Bureaucracy; Communism; Economic system; Municipal law,,,,,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.wiley-gove-v-24-i-4-gove1543 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01543.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01543.x/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01543.x,,10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01543.x,1742280785,,0,000-911-511-032-918; 002-441-661-600-086; 019-066-742-738-488; 019-197-356-207-793; 019-380-053-897-42X; 026-156-902-199-704; 031-641-875-647-857; 032-220-993-507-32X; 034-293-046-158-029; 035-261-961-935-32X; 046-208-046-354-624; 046-776-606-634-524; 050-274-654-059-514; 075-428-805-584-444; 078-436-564-988-681; 084-022-394-011-890; 111-962-016-797-934; 113-741-307-551-153; 116-222-257-785-019; 134-628-309-955-546; 139-186-190-548-754; 143-443-491-610-688; 149-123-401-928-517; 164-289-216-852-884,25,false,,

Simmons; Zachary Elkins,"One of the most important developments over the past three decades has been the spread of liberal economic ideas and policies throughout the world. These policies have affected the lives of millions of people, yet our most sophisticated political economy models do not adequately capture influences on these policy choices. Evidence suggests that the adoption of liberal economic practices is highly clustered both temporally and spatially. We hypothesize that this clustering might be due to processes of policy diffusion. We think of diffusion as resulting from one of two broad sets of forces: one in which mounting adoptions of a policy alter the benefits of adopting for others and another in which adoptions provide policy relevant information about the benefits of adopting. We develop arguments within these broad classes of mechanisms, construct appropriate measures of the relevant concepts, and test their effects on liberalization and restriction of the current account, the capital account, and the exchange rate regime. Our findings suggest that domestic models of foreign economic policy making are insufficient. The evidence shows that policy transitions are influenced by international economic competition as well as the policies of a country's sociocultural peers. We interpret the latter influence as a form of channeled learning reflecting governments' search for appropriate models for economic policy.",98,1,171,189,Economics; Globalization; Exchange-rate regime; International political economy; Capital account; Current account; Economic liberalization; Liberalization; Information economy; Economic system,,,,,https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3157884/Simmons_GlobalizationLiberalization.pdf?sequence=2 http://scholar.harvard.edu/bsimmons/publications/globalization-liberalization-policy-diffusion-international-political-economy https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/3157884/2/Simmons_GlobalizationLiberalization.pdf https://scholar.harvard.edu/bsimmons/publications/globalization-liberalization-policy-diffusion-international-political-economy https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/globalization-of-liberalization-policy-diffusion-in-the-international-political-economy/B5221E84026490BEAD28085A42D636C0 http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/3157884/2/Simmons_GlobalizationLiberalization.pdf http://www.rochelleterman.com/ir/sites/default/files/Simmons_GlobalizationLiberalization.pdf https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=zachary_elkins https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/4145304.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/apsrev/v98y2004i01p171-189_00.html http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=205177 https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/15359 https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3157884 https://core.ac.uk/download/28931263.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0003055404001078,,10.1017/s0003055404001078,2123972665,,0,000-477-897-031-950; 000-663-909-364-875; 001-179-757-914-197; 002-918-520-975-795; 003-441-637-386-039; 006-032-589-883-752; 006-421-545-586-405; 007-640-095-574-963; 008-435-384-778-034; 008-869-537-705-070; 009-285-222-350-903; 010-003-191-094-552; 010-178-466-935-635; 011-658-029-134-214; 015-271-876-692-523; 015-414-879-361-880; 017-453-540-599-149; 017-559-575-177-873; 019-163-168-230-27X; 019-689-403-855-613; 021-496-722-828-736; 021-907-061-236-840; 022-157-265-077-251; 024-813-983-826-750; 026-432-771-531-196; 028-960-119-067-240; 029-396-582-469-470; 030-862-578-988-527; 031-501-671-180-285; 032-543-293-967-145; 032-853-259-553-241; 033-054-378-083-321; 034-340-327-894-320; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-576-001-630-807; 042-364-524-274-469; 046-024-369-569-631; 046-329-185-900-18X; 047-951-023-183-794; 048-043-313-040-671; 048-222-432-062-519; 049-219-615-824-319; 050-438-609-157-391; 051-138-259-192-307; 051-615-570-495-561; 051-874-080-260-395; 052-433-668-204-143; 054-809-438-594-196; 056-220-769-860-533; 059-413-948-067-83X; 061-036-272-359-197; 061-335-347-559-530; 064-030-164-836-728; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-228-324-702-34X; 068-414-274-727-416; 069-208-127-389-559; 069-776-883-740-143; 069-909-494-409-568; 070-280-023-750-823; 070-605-227-299-571; 070-928-438-572-263; 073-270-682-356-889; 075-114-262-940-454; 078-127-170-814-938; 078-465-994-236-60X; 083-062-617-862-060; 083-099-894-950-017; 083-350-034-769-24X; 084-197-742-745-570; 085-065-445-021-80X; 090-376-730-069-529; 090-441-193-209-941; 090-491-533-429-584; 093-120-955-663-916; 093-150-414-259-272; 095-343-352-543-81X; 095-730-291-498-831; 096-527-310-783-308; 097-654-427-607-349; 099-369-848-922-486; 099-941-921-077-245; 101-127-387-013-017; 104-586-674-667-883; 105-332-156-929-317; 106-657-028-963-029; 108-515-111-386-68X; 110-309-926-544-567; 110-948-868-848-79X; 111-396-820-891-581; 111-459-997-118-741; 111-728-885-213-480; 112-026-380-207-034; 113-594-726-213-530; 114-898-336-509-01X; 115-179-826-274-001; 116-240-533-363-648; 116-413-843-703-313; 117-497-428-542-089; 118-369-367-297-955; 126-150-841-012-296; 127-826-672-055-220; 128-150-266-973-359; 128-980-952-348-046; 129-095-071-614-337; 129-349-979-139-342; 129-360-167-884-344; 129-543-580-966-505; 131-806-887-165-298; 131-900-393-723-959; 137-289-819-241-725; 137-825-348-730-149; 140-212-810-563-253; 142-472-386-597-641; 148-223-435-969-407; 150-444-392-623-801; 152-406-120-995-527; 157-087-652-883-493; 157-924-243-290-801; 160-263-143-608-248; 160-614-078-170-308; 163-113-113-856-65X; 168-219-986-889-01X; 174-363-963-405-178; 176-388-714-390-722; 176-596-256-220-588; 176-962-852-554-696; 180-864-930-572-335; 183-966-824-202-847; 185-971-827-478-792; 187-151-090-396-571; 188-332-136-393-173; 190-032-990-340-879; 190-662-037-073-215,1304,true,,green
077-997-648-246-830,A disseminação de políticas de desenvolvimento territorial rural na américa latina: um estudo comparado entre Brasil e Argentina,2014-02-14,2014,dissertation,,,,,João Paulo Ghesti,"The main objective of this thesis is to understand the elements of the process of dissemination of public policies with territorial rural approach in a Latin American context by analyzing the cases of Brazil and Argentina. The research question is “how the institutional context influences the transfer of public policies with territorial approach to rural development?” Stemming from the notion that Brazil and Argentina emulated elements of the European LEADER Programme in formulating their territorial approach policies, this study seeks to carry out an interdisciplinary discussion between the theoretical assumptions of new institutionalism and the conceptual framework of policy transfer from Dolowitz and Marsh, dealing with the international movement of ideas and practices, using concepts such as policy diffusion and lesson-drawing. Thus, it is done a comparative analysis of how the Brazilian and Argentinean experiences can trigger off the diffusion of territorial approach policies in rural development. The analysis of the data is divided into three parts: the first part analyzes the model LEADER, starting from the conceptual framework of the lesson-drawing and moving on to the constraints from policy transfer. In the light of the concept of fungibility proposed by Rose (1993), a special type of fungibility is identified: the international diffusion of lessons, that is, the dissemination of a highly generalizable lesson to any institutional context. This lesson is also rationally attractive and justifiable, but is hardly efficient or effective in relation to the transfer of its contents.Two basic premises of this concept are scrutinized in the concrete cases of Brazil and Argentina: the abstract fungibility of institutions and the political desirability. Finally, the thesis, as a whole, provides an outline of a possible Latin American diffusion pattern of territorial policies for rural development: international diffusion of lessons, a mix of lesson-drawing with institutional isomorphism. Lesson-drawing due to politicians proactive search for advantageous lessons in terms of legitimacy; and isomorphism due to the fact this search for lessons seems to be motivated not by efficiency or effectiveness, but for the need for immediate accommodation to the legacy failures of previous models of rural development.",,,,,Fungibility; Public policy; Regional science; Political science; Policy transfer; The Conceptual Framework; New institutionalism; Context (language use); LEADER programme; Isomorphism (sociology),,,,,https://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/17036/1/2014_JoaoPauloGhesti.pdf https://repositorio.unb.br/handle/10482/17036,https://repositorio.unb.br/handle/10482/17036,,,2289833758,,0,,0,false,,

Contributing an original reform index of criminal procedure reform across Mexico’s 32 states from 2002-2011 and building on existing research on policy diffusion, this paper offers answers to these questions. Core findings include: (1) the 2008 constitutional reform at the federal level exerts a strong, positive effect (federal mandate); (2) being in a neighborhood of states that have reformed has a counterintuitive, negative effect (spatial proximity); and (3) having a governor of the same party as that of governors of other states that have reformed has a positive influence (network affinity).

Each paper in the dissertation investigates a different set of factors that affect the scope and nature of bureaucrats’ policy engagement. “The Millennium Effect?: When and Where does Bureaucratic Quality Matter for Human Development” looks at an international factor, the global advocacy for Millennium Development Goals, and examines its effect on the relationship between bureaucratic quality and social policy outcomes across different policy areas and task types. Designed as a cross-country comparative study, it uses country-level quantitative data. “Trusting Relations, Learning Bureaucrats: International Organisations and Early-Stage Policy Diffusion” focusses on another international factor, the World Bank, and examines its role in the adoption of the conditional cash transfer model in Turkey and Indonesia. The study employs within-case process tracing with a comparative lens and uses data from interviews and document reviews. “The Bargaining Bureaucrat: Policy Bargains and Effects of Political Context and Organisational Traits on Bureaucrats’ Policy Influence” investigates the influence of individual bureaucrats in policymaking processes with a focus on the effects of political context and organisational traits. The study uses data from interviews and employs a novel analytical model built on bargaining theory. “After the Dust Settles: Mergers, Policymaking Processes, Mid-Level Bureaucrats” examines the effect of organisational structure on policymaking processes and bureaucrats’ engagement in these processes. It is a case study of the merger of five social policy agencies in Turkey and uses data from interviews and document reviews. By putting a spotlight on the often-invisible bureaucrats, these four papers contribute to our understanding about the factors shaping the scope of bureaucrats’ policy influence in low- and middle-income countries. More generally, this dissertation draws attention to the need for a more systematic incorporation of bureaucracy into our analyses of social policy change.",,,,,Development studies; Political science; Organizational structure; Social policy; Process tracing; Conditional cash transfer; Millennium Development Goals; Human development (humanity); Public administration; Bureaucracy,,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.770813 https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2d2f398a-c4c1-45a7-9ef8-577ca6097e84,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.770813,,,2954884287,,0,,0,false,,

079-542-898-939-789,"The micro-dynamics of environmental policy diffusion: conditions, motivations, and mechanisms",2016-02-01,2016,dissertation,,,,,Michal Nachmany,"This thesis contributes to the scholarship on policy diffusion in general, and on environmental policy diffusion in particular, by unpicking the drivers of different diffusion mechanisms. Its overarching aim is to investigate the motivational dynamics influencing environmental policymaking at the fuzzy, understudied, pre-legislative stage. The thesis comprises four standalone papers: The first paper (Chapter 2) examines policymakers’ motivations to engage with the climate change mitigation agenda based on a case study of Israeli climate change mitigation policy. It suggests that Israel’s engagement with the climate change mitigation agenda, displaying an evident pattern of diffusion by emulating developed countries, is significantly motivated by considerations of internal, rather than external, legitimacy, contrary to expectations. The second paper (Chapter 3) makes theoretical advancements in recognising issue attributes as explanatory factors for the different mechanisms of policy diffusion, addressing an acknowledged gap in the literature. The third paper (Chapter 4) is an empirical application of the issue attributes model introduced in Chapter 3; the concept is applied to three diffusion processes of environmental issues in Israel: climate change, air pollution, and waste, analysing the differences in the attributes of these three issues, and subsequently, the differences in diffusion mechanisms in practice. The fourth paper (Chapter 5) investigates GLOBE International, a previously unstudied network of legislators committed to advancing climate change legislation. Its main findings show that GLOBE facilitates a mechanism of policy and political learning, but perhaps more interestingly, generates network-enabled emotional energy and esprit de corps among its members, which has helped to motivate and sustain climate action by legislators. The thesis takes a qualitative, microlevel approach, utilising data from 64 interviews with policy actors from 21 countries, as well supporting textual sources, thus contributing to the qualitative knowledge base needed to support analytical aggregations on policy diffusion processes.",,,,,Public economics; Climate change; Political science; Globe; Legislation; Scholarship; Mechanism (sociology); Legitimacy; Climate change mitigation; Management science; Politics,,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.706159 http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/3466/,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.706159,,,2596857273,,0,003-592-471-884-916; 008-414-059-072-131; 013-158-707-082-436; 014-342-791-988-72X; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-419-031-338-034; 023-672-511-213-267; 034-431-213-473-281; 035-689-436-224-80X; 036-259-082-808-838; 039-664-709-632-96X; 052-987-323-475-516; 058-071-798-060-611; 064-813-962-509-941; 066-141-735-734-026; 081-118-035-104-953; 083-128-427-871-272; 086-722-215-077-078; 087-424-172-319-399; 094-354-458-104-126; 094-833-112-635-235; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-197-270-103-414; 102-920-097-411-359; 135-215-958-327-903; 162-353-827-659-064; 193-479-506-330-290,0,false,,

Matisoff,"This paper draws upon policy innovation literature and quantitatively explains the adoption of state climate change policies, leading to a broader question—what makes states more likely to adopt policies that provide a global public good? First, existing empirical evidence relating to state climate change policy adoption is reviewed. Following this brief discussion, several analytic approaches are presented that test specific hypotheses derived from the internal determinants and regional diffusion models of policy adoption. Policy diffusion is tested as a function of the motivations, resources, and obstacles of policy change. Motivations for policy innovation include environmental conditions and demands of citizens. Resources include state financial and geographic resources, such as wind and solar potential. Obstacles include a state's reliance on carbon-intensive industries such as coal and natural gas. The results show that internal factors, particularly citizens' demands, are stronger predictors of states' policies than are diffusion effects from neighboring states.",25,6,527,546,Public economics; Policy analysis; Energy policy; Climate change; Economics; Empirical evidence; Policy studies; Global public good; Portfolio; Economic growth; Function (engineering),,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00360.x/abstract https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/revpol/v25y2008i6p527-546.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00360.x https://econpapers.repec.org/article/blarevpol/v_3a25_3ay_3a2008_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a527-546.htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00360.x,,10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00360.x,2126862646,,0,006-282-272-395-98X; 014-694-012-786-985; 017-522-617-610-438; 018-454-798-334-448; 036-961-749-635-681; 046-440-021-222-744; 051-484-829-139-99X; 058-903-156-385-886; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-905-690-168-04X; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-521-648-921-392; 084-787-681-556-687; 085-089-861-083-141; 096-517-829-236-651; 100-580-372-997-18X; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-208-298-196-530; 102-490-342-063-275; 102-797-199-716-865; 105-119-082-334-798; 116-976-658-849-459; 122-251-068-357-672; 122-515-647-781-589; 145-099-835-409-64X; 159-206-509-359-009; 159-774-184-936-415; 161-435-971-006-597,226,false,,
080-104-933-869-604,"Global Mental Health Policy Diffusion, Institutionalization, and Innovation",,2013,,,,,,Gordon C Shen,"Author(s): Shen, Gordon Chit-Nga | Advisor(s): Snowden, Lonnie R | Abstract: Mental health is an integral part of health and well-being. Mental health enables people to realize their potential, cope with the stressors of everyday life, and make contributions to society. Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders constitute 13% of the global burden of disease. And yet, across all countries, public investment in preventing and treating this cluster of disorders is disproportionately low relative to this disease burden. Health systems have not adequately or sufficiently responded to the burden of MNS disorders: the gap between the need and supply of treatment ranges from 76% to 85% in low- and middle-income countries, and from 35% to 50% in high-income countries. Mounting evidence underlines the inequitable distribution, poor quality, and inefficient use of scarce resources to address mental health needs. Globally, annual spending on mental health is less than US $2 per person in high-income countries and less than US $0.25 per person in low-income countries, with 67% of these financial resources allocated to stand-alone mental hospitals. Flagrant abuse of human rights and discrimination against people with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities have been found in such psychiatric institutions. The redirecting of mental health budgets toward community-based services, including the integration of mental health into general health care settings, is needed. To address this state of affairs, this dissertation takes a fresh look at the actions taken to formulate a comprehensive, coordinated response from health and social sectors. It is founded at the nexus of new institutional, world culture, and diffusion of innovation theories.This dissertation employs a mixed methods approach, combining statistical and survey analyses. A mental health policy is an official statement of a government that defines its vision, values, principles, and objectives to improve the mental health of a population. It also outlines the areas of actions, strategies, timeframes, budgets, targets and indicators used to realize the vision and achieve the objectives of the policy. In the first study, I examine the coercive and emulative isomorphic effects on the diffusion of mental health policy across geopolitical borders. Using discrete-time data for 193 countries covering the period from 1950 to 2011, I conduct an event history analysis to examine the influence of WHO accession, foreign aid, and peer influence on mental health policy adoption. The results confirm that the act of adopting mental health policy is partly owed to membership in the World Health Organization, as well as influence of neighbors in the same World Bank and World Health Organization regions. National mental health policy adoption is trumpeted as a milestone for mental health reform. Is mental health policy limited to a rhetorical plane or taken up for pragmatic reasons? The effectiveness of this ""upstream"" factor could be realized based on examining ""downstream"" models of deinstitutionalized programming. While mental health policy adoption is treated as an outcome of interest in the first study, it is treated as a predictor in the second study. More specifically, I test the phase of policy adoption as a determinant of psychiatric bed rate changes using panel data for the same 193 countries between 2001 and 2011. The analysis finds that late-adopters of mental health policy are more likely to reduce psychiatric beds in mental hospitals and other biomedical settings than innovators, whereas they are less likely than non-adopters to reduce psychiatric beds in general hospitals. Deinstitutionalization is a much more complex and sophisticated process than reducing dehospitalization, or the reduction of psychiatric beds. It is also about improving the quality of care provided by inpatient facilities while increasing access to care through the development of mental health services in other medical and community settings. However, progress towards mental health reform is often stalled because it is an essentially contested issue in professional and advocacy circles and a highly politicized one among governments. For these reasons, the third study gathers contemporary perspectives on deinstitutionalization from 78 mental health experts. The survey administered assesses their knowledge, attitude, and practices of expanding community-based mental health services and/or downsizing institution-based care. The respondents also attested to the enabling, reinforcing, and constraining factors prevalent in the 42 countries they collectively represent. The qualitative evidence is complementary to the quantitative evidence in that it portrays the contemporary mental health system as being controlled by a nucleus of inpatient care. It further suggests that innovations are made in linking specialty services with primary and social services to support people with mental, neurological, and substance use disorders and their families as they (re)integrate into their communities. Mental health care has branched out in new directions at the turn of the 21st century. Time and again when governments are in the throes of strengthening their mental health systems, a closer look into the setup of infrastructure, essential medicines, human resources, and civil society involvement becomes necessary. This dissertation demonstrates that deinstitutionalization is a result of mental health policies imposed from the top down by the government. The experience with deinstitutionalizing mental health care also involves grassroots mobilization of social change by citizens, clients, families, and other advocates. In parallel with service reorganization, advances have been made in training lay personnel to offer services to people with MNS disorders. Research and development have made treatment more cost-effective and accessible. Cutting across temporal and geographic borders, tradition and modernity, this dissertation probes into the permeability of mental health policy and unpacks the complexity of deinstitutionalization.",,,,,Middle Eastern Mental Health Issues & Syndromes; Mental health; Public health; Political science; Health promotion; International health; Global mental health; Health policy; Economic growth; Mental health law,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0fs1v90r.pdf https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0fs1v90r,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0fs1v90r,,,2217151387,,0,,1,false,,

McDonald; Jooho Lee,"This article examines the vertical diffusion of a policy between a state and its local governments. Although policy diffusion typically relies upon multiple mechanisms, diffusion between a state and its local governments relies primarily on coercion. Using a case study of state-mandated adherence to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), we show that the coercion mechanism is dependent upon the capacity of the state and local governments to adopt and implement a policy, as well as the discretion available to a local government. Utilizing data from all 50 states as of 2008, our findings show that the vertical diffusion of a policy is reliant on a state’s fiscal capacity and the personnel capacity of the local government. We also found that strong institutional autonomy at the local level leads a state to adopt a GAAP mandate.",48,2,188,200,Accounting standard; Business; Nexus (standard); Mandate; Coercion; State (polity); Discretion; Local government; Autonomy; Economic system,,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0275074016675966 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0275074016675966 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0275074016675966 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6269136,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0275074016675966,,10.1177/0275074016675966,2552143132,,0,001-823-310-430-81X; 003-374-054-879-758; 005-310-646-050-791; 008-875-597-674-561; 014-368-268-848-568; 018-274-620-145-721; 023-236-082-357-690; 026-477-902-557-601; 035-924-782-957-376; 036-062-108-111-758; 037-615-652-998-608; 039-453-056-515-730; 041-702-193-495-621; 041-794-014-797-415; 044-622-643-964-237; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-130-406-422-721; 064-836-606-751-979; 065-550-286-812-535; 069-823-523-980-468; 076-218-656-585-347; 076-240-693-922-091; 080-646-729-626-169; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-419-535-897-070; 086-254-802-036-25X; 089-506-852-612-89X; 092-704-053-629-025; 096-362-816-439-456; 096-763-299-175-014; 096-882-680-395-78X; 096-926-225-044-39X; 097-981-956-853-877; 100-677-977-860-507; 105-258-210-489-146; 107-218-373-155-876; 109-851-566-596-076; 111-752-857-667-40X; 128-773-776-408-772; 152-038-094-597-050; 173-073-872-735-583; 174-768-369-809-642,20,false,,

Neo-institutionalism and world systems theory differ on whether focus should be given to international convergence or domestic adaptation. Studies addressing historical and contextual dimensions of policy diffusion are relevant as they will further specify the nature of the extranational effects on national policies. The case of Argentina’s national higher education policy is particularly relevant to this literature due to political and academic traditions that have inhibited the diffusion of many global trends into the country.

In addition to new challenges to policy makers, polarization offers new opportunities for experimentation and learning that may be valuable to scholars and practitioners alike.",42,2,363,375,Public economics; Polarization (politics); Political science; Health insurance,Affordable Care Act; ideological polarization; policy diffusion,Health Policy; Humans; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; United States,,,https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article/42/2/363/13890/Policy-Diffusion-in-Polarized-Times-The-Case-of https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28007804,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/03616878-3766762,28007804,10.1215/03616878-3766762,2563066167,,0,001-048-997-114-279; 001-367-136-082-787; 001-481-906-279-295; 001-702-165-034-296; 002-557-636-257-591; 005-391-015-007-591; 019-664-267-521-174; 023-672-511-213-267; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-931-530-068-378; 038-619-779-714-232; 039-735-495-740-660; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-861-949-203-68X; 056-463-174-056-307; 058-046-685-654-371; 058-071-798-060-611; 064-753-387-756-134; 067-490-686-317-462; 073-753-993-648-180; 077-495-223-631-426; 120-911-773-457-984; 129-377-675-538-49X; 144-664-608-542-427; 155-580-858-393-517; 157-968-607-593-999; 176-306-096-567-989,7,true,,bronze

First, IGO networks facilitate policy learning by providing relevant information. Second, they encourage policy emulation by creating a sense of affinity among countries that are closely connected by IGO networks. Finally, some powerful IGOs ‘‘coerce’’ their member states to adopt certain policies. We used causal modeling to test the relationships between different types of IGOs (and the causal mechanisms to which they mostly correspond) and policy convergence. The findings demonstrate the important roles played by salient IGOs such as the WTO, the EU, and the OECD, with each of them having a strong converging effect on their member states’ domestic economic policies. More interestingly, we find that the cumulative effects of multiple layers of even the weakest types of IGOs have strong causal effects on states’ domestic policies. Indeed, the shared memberships in IGOs with economic functions and with the minimal level of institutional capacity are not only statistically associated with, but also have converging causal effects on, countries’ domestic policies. This supports the information-driven policy learning mechanism. The emulation mechanism in which IGO networks create a sense of affinity and therefore facilitate policy diffusion and convergence, on the other hand, is not supported by empirical analysis.",53,4,1095,1130,Economic policy; Causal model; Network dynamics; Emulation; Economics; Convergence (economics); Salient; Mechanism (sociology); Causal effect; Institutional capacity,,,,,http://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/53/4/1095/1813738 http://www.personal.psu.edu/xuc11/blogs/x/home/research/CaoISQ2009.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00570.x/full https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/53/4/1095/1813738 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/networks-of-intergovernmental-organizations-and-convergence-in-do http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00570.x/abstract https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00570.x/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00570.x,,10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00570.x,2007011519,,0,000-534-965-105-391; 000-914-644-435-765; 002-527-874-108-025; 002-826-166-575-247; 003-025-422-339-881; 006-421-545-586-405; 008-986-463-467-067; 010-376-175-836-706; 012-182-376-455-376; 014-648-011-111-540; 014-719-833-896-709; 016-857-978-568-376; 017-523-415-720-916; 017-842-105-849-325; 018-590-967-575-135; 021-338-591-258-046; 023-596-016-492-826; 023-707-523-136-761; 025-193-488-999-63X; 027-123-132-556-925; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-388-056-843-087; 035-870-065-215-256; 036-159-702-886-637; 038-723-719-475-911; 047-483-088-068-653; 047-992-557-420-505; 050-612-040-434-470; 052-814-003-831-336; 053-406-954-147-680; 053-580-247-638-329; 055-775-678-222-459; 056-305-091-551-309; 059-692-575-656-993; 060-629-517-891-622; 061-036-272-359-197; 062-877-575-225-439; 063-134-333-671-865; 063-149-938-949-77X; 064-336-406-971-626; 065-666-299-776-558; 065-992-235-697-432; 071-004-709-718-09X; 074-416-178-349-810; 075-016-213-883-001; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-846-878-596-830; 082-603-283-944-981; 086-116-534-070-199; 088-475-500-672-375; 088-970-978-435-553; 090-651-826-892-097; 093-594-707-758-881; 097-419-955-788-796; 101-058-395-846-549; 101-695-601-031-044; 103-856-742-498-550; 107-059-599-574-664; 107-605-926-265-849; 111-727-111-304-042; 111-819-171-804-346; 112-251-884-513-781; 113-178-467-679-623; 113-535-697-545-463; 120-686-420-989-186; 125-820-718-665-738; 128-402-767-683-008; 131-076-765-815-326; 139-186-190-548-754; 140-219-007-691-020; 143-351-408-902-404; 145-922-139-792-17X; 147-275-878-030-579; 153-763-829-691-813; 156-264-681-585-610; 156-331-542-878-621; 162-717-451-214-458; 165-358-827-428-487; 186-635-856-409-490; 195-459-088-993-271,90,true,,green

Although diffusion processes are empirically proven, we witness two shortcomings in the discussion: First, there is a lack of comparative research across policy areas. Second, the question of why diffusion might not occur in a certain domain is under-theorized and lacks an empirical test. By comparing the rationale behind diffusion processes in two policy domains—energy policy and locational policy—this paper shows that two aspects matter for diffusion processes: First is the observability of policy measures, that is, how easily things can be observed by others; second is the competitiveness of the policy domain. If policy measures can be hidden easily and the policy domain is highly competitive, policy diffusion is very unlikely to happen. Therefore, we seek the integration of these two aspects in prospective diffusion research.",45,4,345,358,Public economics; Comparative research; Positive economics; Empirical research; Policy analysis; Energy policy; Diffusion (business); Economics; Domain (software engineering); Witness; Competition (economics),,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11077-012-9149-7 https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/policy/v45y2012i4p345-358.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11077-012-9149-7.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:kap:policy:v:45:y:2012:i:4:p:345-358 https://core.ac.uk/display/11293711 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/66216/10/ZORA_NL_66216.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-012-9149-7,,10.1007/s11077-012-9149-7,2030289977,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 001-481-906-279-295; 003-592-471-884-916; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-199-445-632-772; 023-138-158-491-820; 029-694-779-807-168; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-689-436-224-80X; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 043-283-110-483-043; 043-547-850-265-638; 045-604-047-008-211; 047-127-619-842-863; 048-624-554-561-959; 049-519-595-570-845; 050-082-471-457-812; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 065-010-320-493-607; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-910-992-767-489; 071-574-179-917-714; 073-055-174-017-117; 074-591-312-235-434; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-620-947-306-135; 077-945-151-328-246; 080-080-940-303-111; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-787-681-556-687; 089-168-057-996-063; 091-380-232-071-077; 093-190-746-631-057; 101-127-387-013-017; 106-352-974-752-749; 112-333-966-495-520; 112-362-672-801-839; 113-070-268-128-816; 115-667-337-333-237; 118-513-543-976-791; 120-295-955-293-865; 132-239-025-142-98X; 145-490-347-948-398; 155-580-858-393-517; 162-739-678-156-333; 163-637-734-144-951; 171-679-671-885-909,17,true,,green

By the use of two survey experiments in very different political contexts—Texas and Denmark—and a difference-in-differences analysis exploiting a reform of the political governance of public schools in Denmark, we find that public managers respond to political pressure.

The organization is a network of trans‐governmental networks linking government bureaucracies in member and (increasingly also) non‐member states, emerging economies in particular. Its institutional advantages are its broad and select member‐ship, and its ability to work with practically all policy areas. In a highly variable and flexible in‐stitutional geometry, the OECD is the site for a range of governance activities pertaining to agenda setting, soft harmonization of national policies across multiple policy areas, and hard regulation in the form of conventions and other instruments where the OECD represents a forum for inter‐state decision making as well as policy implementation. Morten Ougaard argues that the OECD facilitates the development of joint responses to common challenges and consensus on broad contours of strategic direction setting in macro‐economic and other policy areas.

In this study, we consider the extent to which various initiatives of Canadian federal and provincial (Quebec) funders have affected the development of institutional research integrity/misconduct (RIM) policies. Examining the creation and modification dates of 32 institutional RIM policies, we find that federal but not provincial initiatives appear to have the greatest impact on the development of RIM policies. Idiosyncrasies in the creation dates, as well as lack of evidence of a systematic pattern in modification dates, suggest a complex system that is often insulated from certain government initiatives. These results lead us to conclude that there should be greater consistency in the development or updating of RIM policies to ensure the appropriate treatment of misconduct and to encourage behaviour that meets the highest standards of research integrity. Resume Au cours de la derniere decennie, les institutions academiques et les bailleurs de fonds de recherche ont consacre beaucoup d’efforts a l’elaboration de politiques pour soutenir l’integrite scientifique et prevenir les inconduites en recherche. Dans la presente etude, nous analysons dans quelle mesure les diverses initiatives des bailleurs de fonds canadiens, tant federaux que provinciaux (Quebec), ont affecte l’elaboration de politiques institutionnelles sur l’integrite et les inconduites en recherche (IIR). En examinant les dates de creation et de modification de 32 politiques institutionnelles sur l’IIR, nous constatons que ce sont les initiatives federales, et non provinciales, qui semblent avoir le plus grand effet sur l’elaboration de politiques. Des idiosyncrasies dans les dates de creation, ainsi que l’absence de preuves d’un modele systematique de dates de modification, suggerent un systeme complexe, souvent isole de certaines initiatives gouvernementales. Ces resultats nous amenent a conclure qu’il devrait y avoir une plus grande coherence dans l’elaboration ou la mise a jour de politiques sur l’IIR pour assurer le traitement approprie des inconduites et encourager un comportement qui repond aux normes les plus elevees d’integrite en recherche.",46,1,57,75,Humanities; Political science; Institutional research; Misconduct; Scientific integrity; Research integrity; Operations research,,,,,https://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/view/185166 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1098269 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1098269.pdf http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1098269.pdf https://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/download/185166/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.47678/cjhe.v46i1.185166,,10.47678/cjhe.v46i1.185166,2342525931,,0,,2,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold
082-210-325-075-685,Policymaking under Globalization Pressures: Reforming Public Utilities in Latin America,2006-12-01,2006,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Maria Victoria Murillo,"To analyse the role of partisan beliefs and interests, this paper focuses on two industriesâ€”telecoms and electricityâ€”which have been subject to strong pressures for policy diffusion and thereby are unlikely candidates for showing traces of partisanship. In the implementation of three dimensions of these reforms in three countries, this paper shows that partisan beliefs and interests influenced policy implementation with the former playing a stronger role when the policies are more easily linked to state regulation of markets facilitating their assessment over distributive expectations. Because the mechanisms for policy preference formation are defined in debates within the government coalition and political survival was a crucial incentive in policy adoption for â€œconvertsâ€ to these reforms, electoral competition can easily tip the balance in internal debates over policy preferences. Financial exposure also gives incentives for increasing the incentives to revenue maximization through the creation of rents, which can be distributed to partisan allies. Yet, neither financial exposure, nor technological pressures explain the process of preference formation and need to be complemented by partisan beliefs and interests.

082-643-432-403-158,What Curbs Social Investment? The Effect of Foreign Electoral Outcomes on Childcare Expenditure Levels,2022-01-06,2022,journal article,Journal of Social Policy,00472794; 14697823,Cambridge University Press (CUP),United Kingdom,SIMONE TONELLI,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>; 	  <jats:p>This study aims to deepen our understanding of social investment expansion proposing a political learning mechanism to link existing institutional and political explanations. When resources are limited, increased spending in social investment often comes at the expense of politically costly retrenchment of established social insurance policies. Previous studies suggest that this trade-off results in existing entitlements crowding out new policies, and that party ideology plays less of a role in determining social policy expansion. I argue that this is because parties face an electoral dilemma, as individual preferences for social investment and social insurance have been shown to differ between groups that partly overlap in their voting behaviour. Applying a policy diffusion framework to the analysis of childcare expenditure, this study proposes that policymakers learn from the political consequences of past decisions made by their foreign counterparts and update their policy choice accordingly. The econometric analysis of OECD data on childcare expenditure shows that governments tend to make spending decisions that follow those of ideologically similar cabinets abroad and that left-wing governments with a divided electorate tend to reduce childcare expenditure if a previous expansionary decision of a foreign incumbent is followed by an electoral defeat. The findings have implications for the study of the politics of social policy development.</jats:p>",,,1,21,Economics; Social insurance; Retrenchment; Ideology; Public economics; Politics; Investment (military); Voting; Dilemma; Social policy; Crowding out; Economic policy; Labour economics; Market economy; Macroeconomics; Political science; Public administration; Philosophy; Epistemology; Law,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0047279421000908,,10.1017/s0047279421000908,,,0,001-048-997-114-279; 002-557-636-257-591; 003-120-389-421-319; 005-553-153-856-945; 006-098-301-515-814; 006-673-195-318-435; 006-722-686-316-360; 007-374-819-332-822; 009-257-474-542-110; 018-903-063-385-19X; 019-933-114-114-44X; 020-751-951-221-363; 023-672-511-213-267; 025-261-533-926-731; 029-576-416-206-163; 030-716-503-815-626; 033-085-475-899-252; 038-948-985-115-609; 039-308-799-147-106; 039-389-860-012-890; 040-375-935-541-34X; 040-689-410-693-756; 041-383-954-687-105; 041-659-281-349-623; 046-112-289-222-566; 046-956-323-602-686; 047-978-771-685-677; 048-227-174-646-062; 052-340-235-749-831; 052-846-321-460-629; 054-027-690-094-277; 056-694-915-825-950; 058-071-798-060-611; 060-419-301-931-423; 061-308-647-817-198; 061-373-791-267-531; 063-504-944-027-038; 064-542-733-606-527; 067-121-006-432-261; 075-306-027-090-943; 077-495-223-631-426; 079-155-575-385-638; 082-017-566-839-450; 082-713-496-948-967; 083-128-427-871-272; 083-620-105-108-236; 084-259-974-882-794; 085-301-057-452-781; 085-980-180-128-634; 089-667-498-175-718; 090-483-162-863-815; 100-190-910-402-961; 106-404-230-876-257; 107-897-248-850-025; 112-238-569-307-615; 115-292-903-924-077; 117-873-338-012-718; 118-513-543-976-791; 120-119-111-639-974; 122-773-354-119-921; 125-430-975-297-40X; 129-827-239-773-157; 133-848-761-734-799; 134-368-094-208-712; 137-051-141-347-832; 146-747-266-480-954; 155-580-858-393-517; 169-620-600-250-182; 175-772-396-656-483; 181-904-469-222-141; 191-948-962-480-600,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

This article improves our understanding of this elusive argument by distinguishing between the policy and political consequences of reforms and by emphasizing the conditional nature of learning processes. Using a directed dyadic approach and multilevel methods, the analysis of unemployment benefits retrenchment in OECD countries demonstrates that policy makers learn selectively from the experience of others.

Schmidt,"Preemption-when a higher level of government limits the authority of a lower level to enact new policies-has been devastating to tobacco control. We developed a preemption framework based on this experience for anticipating and responding to the possibility of preemption in other public health areas. We analyzed peer-reviewed literature, reports, and government documents pertaining to tobacco control preemption. We triangulated data and thematically analyzed them.Since the 1980s, tobacco companies have attempted to secure state preemption through front groups, lobbying key policymakers, inserting preemption into other legislation, and issuing legal threats and challenges. The tobacco control community responded by creating awareness of preemption through media advocacy, educating policymakers, mobilizing national collaborations, and expanding networks with the legal community. Ten of the 25 state smoke-free preemption laws have been fully repealed. Repeal, however, took an average of 11 years.State preemption has been detrimental to tobacco control by dividing the health community, weakening local authority, chilling public education and debate, and slowing local policy diffusion. Health scholars, advocates, and policymakers should use the framework to anticipate and prevent industry use of preemption in other public health areas.",110,3,345,350,Public health; Business; Government; Preemption; State (polity); Legislation; Local government; Repeal; Tobacco control; Public administration,,Humans; Lobbying; Local Government; Public Health/legislation & jurisprudence; Smoking Prevention/legislation & jurisprudence; State Government; Tobacco Industry/legislation & jurisprudence; United States,,NCI NIH HHS (T32 CA113710) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR001872) United States,https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305473 https://dx.doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2019.305473 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31944839 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31944839/ https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9f16q628,http://dx.doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2019.305473,31944839,10.2105/ajph.2019.305473,2998900415,PMC7002944,0,001-784-698-754-175; 007-583-322-746-043; 008-272-124-071-645; 008-781-491-143-52X; 012-654-000-434-051; 014-077-663-337-215; 016-365-737-814-889; 016-922-190-269-723; 020-325-332-035-578; 022-115-454-772-602; 022-748-766-715-041; 024-778-963-126-756; 026-435-922-335-824; 029-200-150-420-414; 029-366-979-732-524; 036-922-241-103-682; 042-219-751-938-199; 044-478-253-583-048; 044-649-002-222-866; 045-228-055-311-513; 045-264-992-581-452; 048-210-446-163-267; 063-740-385-034-585; 065-201-367-923-610; 068-031-307-341-299; 075-692-820-995-922; 088-108-854-871-289; 090-000-890-350-082; 091-493-549-920-488; 096-166-623-088-858; 103-922-900-042-931; 124-960-952-480-828; 138-359-557-125-835; 154-661-395-623-619; 168-541-071-345-212,17,true,,green

Miller; Jill Nicholson-Crotty; Sean Nicholson-Crotty,Policy diffusion scholarship has long sought to understand when lawmakers will imitate innovations adopted by other jurisdictions and when they actually invest the time and resources necessary to learn about potential policies. We develop the theoretical rationale that term limits will reduce the incentive and capacity of state legislatures to gather information about policies available from previous adoptions in other states. We hypothesize that this will decrease the importance of previous adopters when term-limited legislators consider policy innovations.

083-757-786-570-975,The Enactment of Reforms in State Governance of Higher Education: Testing the Political Instability Hypothesis,,2007,journal article,The Journal of Higher Education,15384640; 00221546,Informa UK Limited,United Kingdom,Michael K. McLendon; Russ Deaton; James C. Hearn,"The theory and practice of public-sector management in the United States have undergone significant change in the past 20 years. In the 1980s and 1990s, the century-old approach to the provision of public services through vast bureaucracies began to collapse in the face of critiques alleging inadequate government performance, responsiveness, and accountability. (1) A central emphasis of reform involved the role of institutions. Institutions matter in public management, analysts and observers maintained, because organizational structure influences the manner in which services are provided. Thus, reformers heavily emphasized developing new structural models of public governance. A similar emphasis on structural change can be seen in the 20-year old phenomenon involving reforms in state governance of higher education. (2) Since the mid-1980s, the American states have engaged in a flurry of reform in their approaches to public college and university governance. While some of the measures amounted to little more than tinkering around the edges of existing governance regimes, others involved extensive redesigns of system structure and authority (Leslie & Novak, 2003; Marcus, 1997; McGuinness, 1997; McLendon, 2003b). However, little is known empirically about the origins of governance change in public higher education. Public-administration scholars have built a robust conceptual and empirical literature in pursuit of understanding how, why, and with what consequence public-sector activity is structured and managed (e.g., Lynn, Heinrich, & Hill, 2000). By contrast, scholars of state governance of higher education traditionally have focused on the general patterns by which public higher education is organized (the ""how"" question) or on the effects of governance arrangements at the state and campus levels (the ""consequence"" question). (3) Why states adopt the governance arrangements they do remains elusive--conceptually and empirically. There are compelling reasons for rigorous analysis of the determinants of state governance change in higher education. A growing body of research indicates that the manner in which states govern higher education ""matters."" (4) Thus, the restructuring of governance patterns may hold important implications for higher education policy, finance, and management. Somewhat more abstractly, shifting governance patterns afford researchers an excellent opportunity to test general theories of government behavior in the specific context of higher education, where such theories have begun to gain in prominence. Not all states have undertaken reforms. Inevitably, therefore, questions arise as to which factors drove certain states to enact changes. Why have states adopted reforms at the times at which they have? To what extent do conventional explanations of policy adoption hold in the case of higher education governance reform? To what extent have shifting governance patterns been driven by economic considerations, political conditions, or problems internal to higher education? To what extent can a single explanation account for the variety of governance changes observed? In this essay, we report the results of an empirical analysis that pursued these questions. First, we review the contemporary landscape of public higher education governance and of governance change. We then examine several conventional explanations for governance reform, along with a counter-conventional account--what we call the ""political instability hypothesis""--that we believe affords conceptual leverage in understanding policy change. Next, we distill nine hypotheses from literature in the fields of comparative state politics and higher education to guide our investigation. Employing event history analysis, we then test how the demographic, economic, organizational, and political characteristics of states, in concert with policy diffusion pressures among them, influenced the enactment of legislation reforming governance patterns from 1985-2000. …",78,6,645,675,Higher education; Political economy; Government; Economics; Accountability; State (polity); Legislation; Higher education policy; Corporate governance; Economic growth; Politics,,,,,http://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/journal_of_higher_education/v078/78.6mclendon.html https://people.smu.edu/mmclendon/files/2014/08/McLendon-Deaton-Hearn-JHE-2007.pdf http://ihe.uga.edu/uploads/publications/faculty/politicalinstability_Hearn.pdf https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221546.2007.11772075 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ778000 https://www.academia.edu/3660152/The_Enactment_of_Reforms_in_State_Governance_of_Higher_Education_Testing_the_Political_Instability_Hypothesis https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-171020626/the-enactment-of-reforms-in-state-governance-of-higher,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jhe.2007.0041,,10.1353/jhe.2007.0041,2001549567,,0,006-282-272-395-98X; 008-180-005-498-322; 012-349-897-513-991; 013-126-282-071-945; 013-731-807-621-512; 014-442-426-465-339; 014-630-161-069-223; 014-694-012-786-985; 015-591-021-271-179; 016-113-465-641-513; 017-278-269-245-208; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-123-720-228-776; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-019-561-303-434; 022-438-656-847-250; 023-831-104-510-956; 024-177-430-940-284; 027-774-303-184-687; 029-794-495-749-291; 030-381-185-832-25X; 032-288-512-921-839; 032-617-153-708-271; 036-961-749-635-681; 043-745-989-277-534; 047-420-592-819-913; 048-284-787-933-946; 050-082-471-457-812; 054-034-524-337-62X; 058-903-156-385-886; 061-255-658-806-21X; 062-222-159-195-376; 068-905-690-168-04X; 069-909-494-409-568; 070-439-295-045-214; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-423-409-997-697; 076-686-728-070-965; 081-840-373-163-25X; 084-787-681-556-687; 087-535-931-939-575; 096-924-558-296-975; 097-175-468-842-03X; 099-289-651-450-964; 100-072-817-886-925; 101-127-387-013-017; 111-156-255-712-41X; 114-085-735-646-320; 120-702-222-485-312; 126-612-393-757-342; 126-843-827-983-821; 131-900-393-723-959; 134-300-624-191-268; 134-790-108-035-204; 145-260-087-070-588; 150-446-630-720-607; 155-580-858-393-517; 173-567-809-531-297; 174-164-016-171-500; 180-187-712-085-074; 189-917-633-904-27X,76,false,,

Liefferink; Sietske Veenman,"Abstract This paper proposes a framework for analysing domestic factors behind policy diffusion and convergence. Three basic factors are distinguished, determining the extent to which countries are likely to take up different types of new policies. These factors are: culture, institutions and economy. They are operationalized with the help of three indicators: dominant religious tradition (culture), the prevailing orientation towards public/private relations (institutions), and the level of economic development (economy). It is argued that these factors may be important to different degrees, dependent on whether policy change involves the basic goals and ideas of a policy, the instruments applied, or the setting or ‘calibration’ of these instruments. This leads to the hypothesis that countries that are culturally, institutionally or economically close may be expected to adopt similar ideas, instruments or settings in public policy, respectively, and thus are likely to converge on these points.

Victor; Steinar Andresen,"This article investigates the roles of policy diffusion and policy learning in shaping the design of California’s cap-and-trade system. On the surface, it is very similar to other cap-and-trade programs, but in practice many detailed differences reflect active efforts by California policy-makers to avoid flaws that they saw in other systems, such as the EU ETS and the US East Coast’s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. We assess how California’s cap-and-trade system emerged, the significance of policy diffusion, and the lessons for other trading systems by applying two broad sets of theoretical frames—the role of policy diffusion and the role of organized local political concerns. We find that despite the signature status of the trading system, California mostly relies on much less transparent and more costly direct regulation. We also find that California’s cap-and-trade system has developed mostly in its own, special political context, which hampers the feasibility of cross-border trading.",17,3,12,30,Emissions trading; Environmental resource management; Business; International trade; Policy learning; Context (language use); East coast; Greenhouse gas; Politics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/glenvp/v17y2017i3p12-30.html https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/17/3/12/14879/California-s-Cap-and-Trade-System-Diffusion-and https://muse.jhu.edu/article/667502/pdf https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/GLEP_a_00413 https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/2567274,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/glep_a_00413,,10.1162/glep_a_00413,2725515476,,0,003-412-189-797-295; 005-249-461-623-469; 007-017-752-246-341; 008-180-005-498-322; 011-142-410-547-352; 011-822-598-365-719; 021-968-002-240-259; 027-731-919-743-088; 032-235-898-751-342; 039-538-433-033-378; 043-701-202-171-652; 045-090-127-016-160; 055-585-109-110-812; 060-276-171-144-994; 063-662-632-791-655; 072-172-316-513-519; 072-862-908-678-93X; 080-563-752-903-730; 081-619-688-784-488; 085-315-300-845-102; 085-972-628-233-652; 094-049-567-201-733; 101-208-298-196-530; 101-488-954-100-242; 108-166-013-954-847; 108-644-345-941-659; 110-459-979-959-436; 115-320-675-004-759; 125-088-349-922-801; 145-001-655-903-108; 148-460-439-813-652; 155-416-909-615-50X; 163-292-431-419-769; 173-434-315-874-231; 180-666-445-452-885; 185-607-958-646-441,58,true,,green

This chapter argues that to put health high on local social and political agendas necessarily means to transcend project-based work, and move into lasting programme and policy development. The conditions for such approaches are favourable in Healthy Cities, as a number of glocal (global and local) developments invest and sustain longer term perspectives. These conditions include emphases on policy diffusion, social justice, a better understanding of complex systems, and global commitments to the development and implementation of Health in All Policies. These efforts, in turn, are grounded in renewed and tangible support from Universal Health Coverage and Primary Health Care, asset-based community health development, and better insights into what drives (health) equity and economic development. In describing these elements of policy development for value-based Healthy Cities the chapter also gives a firm argument for a broad range of stakeholders to engage successfully in longer term policy change.",,,407,437,Political science; Asset (economics); Glocalization; Community health; Value (ethics); Public administration; Corporate governance; Argument; Equity (economics); Politics,,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7121840 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-6694-3_17 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-6694-3_17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6694-3_17,,10.1007/978-1-4939-6694-3_17,2587922796,,0,000-689-613-412-765; 001-086-924-520-222; 001-127-834-488-976; 001-526-740-127-959; 002-162-093-349-716; 003-367-453-256-536; 003-844-875-080-576; 004-656-260-318-929; 004-943-063-977-716; 005-736-488-592-98X; 005-787-753-088-822; 008-738-535-759-825; 011-199-321-518-186; 013-170-460-774-941; 013-231-596-506-31X; 014-273-915-718-371; 016-169-769-572-011; 018-053-086-891-660; 021-665-502-535-469; 023-278-729-934-221; 023-779-196-280-24X; 027-758-862-736-820; 029-640-001-015-035; 030-639-046-206-772; 032-888-650-345-568; 033-255-110-321-086; 039-814-398-448-479; 045-154-087-450-535; 045-443-631-137-798; 046-399-851-451-608; 048-899-251-036-076; 048-925-959-018-531; 050-443-987-716-871; 050-719-870-807-408; 052-232-224-890-719; 052-311-959-361-338; 056-461-573-407-363; 056-733-300-403-072; 056-847-529-480-389; 058-071-798-060-611; 062-125-433-782-975; 065-221-598-878-851; 066-304-803-794-703; 067-549-632-932-017; 070-963-846-460-598; 071-364-281-228-880; 074-556-227-312-673; 076-102-706-735-717; 084-995-084-309-350; 085-494-587-083-69X; 087-633-577-149-085; 087-840-452-514-386; 088-835-104-818-922; 091-029-029-954-773; 093-650-993-116-591; 096-778-645-744-403; 100-082-723-811-040; 103-508-531-772-547; 104-680-255-341-775; 104-926-284-502-66X; 110-384-475-978-525; 144-033-835-615-947; 147-705-334-986-318; 157-660-640-612-089; 159-623-008-647-712; 161-443-895-870-374; 165-450-196-501-343; 187-090-966-141-375,3,false,,

Bushouse; Jennifer E. Mosley,"The role of philanthropic foundations in the policy process is largely hidden and thus significantly under conceptualized. In this paper, we argue that several key characteristics of foundations serve as advantages for them to play an intermediary role in different stages of the policy process. By leveraging their independent resources, credibility, and strategic giving, they are able to build coalitions of interest to advance and secure preferred policy alternatives through agenda setting, policy diffusion, and coordinating implementation efforts. We provide evidence for this intermediary role through two qualitative case studies, (1) the Pew Charitable Trust’s efforts to promote universal pre-kindergarten, 2002–2012, and (2) multiple foundations’ role in supporting extended foster care in California, 2008–2012. In both cases, we find that foundations wielded significant political power within policy communities by serving as central hubs of information, facilitating coordinated action, incentivizing action, and connecting diverse actors. This allows them to play a crucial, yet veiled, role in attempts to advance policy change. This phenomenon may be welcomed for supporting evidence-based policymaking and capacity building, but is troubling in regards to transparency and accountability.",7,3,289,311,Public policy; Political science; Accountability; Foster care; Transparency (market); Capacity building; Credibility; Public relations; Political communication; Politics,,,,William T.

Grady; Keon S. Chi,"INTRODUCTION For the past three decades, students of public administration have considered the development of innovations within organizations an important topic in organizational theory (e.g., Wilson, 1966; Downs, 1967; Rowe and Boise, 1974; Kingdon, 1984; Altshuler and Zegans, 1990).(1) Paralleling this interest, students of comparative state politics and policy have considered the diffusion of innovations a central element in the process of state policy formulation and agenda setting (e.g., Walker, 1969; Gray, 1973; Savage, 1985a).(2) Both bodies of literature have resulted in important and theoretically rich speculations on the propensity of certain types of organizations to engage in innovative activities and the flow of new ideas within the American federal system. However, students of administration have typically ignored the political context within which public sector innovations emerge and students of interstate policy diffusion have generally treated ""innovations"" as if all new approaches were essentially similar in magnitude. The analysis to follow attempts to merge these literatures by focusing on the political environment surrounding successful state government innovators in the late 1980s. The central premise of the research in that successfully implementing a public sector innovation is fundamentally a political process. While one might expect that new ideas are continually floating around state governments as they attempt to tackle increasingly complex policy problems, only those ideas that capture the attention of relevant decision-makers will eventually become an innovation. The analysis begins with a brief review of the literature regarding the political context of public sector innovation and the literature on differences among innovations that would affect political receptivity to the new approach. The research design, data gathering procedure, and operationalization of different types of innovation are then presented. Analysis is conducted assessing if different types of innovation trigger differential involvement of political actors. The analysis concludes with recommendations for future research in the area of innovation development and execution. THEORETICAL ORIENTATION AND HYPOTHESES Public officials operate in an environment deliberately established (division of labor, chain of command, administrative procedure regulations, overhead political control) to prevent their agencies from embarking on new ideas without the concurrence of other relevant actors within the decision-making environment. Previous work on the decision environment of state agencies (Wright, 1978; Brudney and Hebert, 1987; Miller, 1987) has identified a number of actors involved in agency decision-making and has found that external actor influence varies systematically, depending upon characteristics of the state, the policy responsibilities of the agency, and structural features of the agency in question. The environmental actors identified in this literature are governors, legislators, interest groups, clients, other agencies, federal officials, and professional associations. By their very nature, public sector innovations create turbulence within organizations and policy communities leading to the potential of resource and power relationship changes. However, not all innovations are the same and their differences should, theoretically, affect how they are received by external actors. In Rowe and Boise's (1974) review of innovation theory, they offer a category scheme drawn from Wilson (1966) and Knight (1967) premised on the ""impact"" of the innovation. Impact is defined on two dimensions: organizational impact, ""the amount of organizational and/or societal space, i.e., activities and interactions, affected by an innovation;"" and social impact, ""the degree of radicalness, i.e., extent of change in activities and interaction, of an innovation"" (Ibid., 289). From Wilson (1966) the social scope of the innovation refers to how fundamentally the innovation affects the organization's task environment. …",17,4,468,,Sociology; Public sector; ROWE; Diffusion of innovations; Central element; Public relations; Federalism; Organizational theory; Operationalization; Politics,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/40861602 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-34578/formulating-and-implementing-public-sector-innovations,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-34578/formulating-and-implementing-public-sector-innovations,,,265523599,,0,001-099-114-464-823; 001-984-160-917-565; 002-723-718-213-489; 003-650-949-706-215; 013-753-441-575-394; 036-961-749-635-681; 041-514-466-137-996; 050-845-803-924-097; 066-196-175-938-562; 069-246-795-278-536; 071-361-180-414-699; 072-488-549-475-315; 076-240-693-922-091; 084-154-879-306-982; 096-517-829-236-651; 101-127-387-013-017; 122-702-980-135-349; 127-586-029-676-511; 129-405-833-430-827; 142-387-011-015-100; 148-460-439-813-652; 188-256-636-922-033,3,false,,

The first part of the paper frames pandemics within in the context of international law, focusing especially on the right to health, the WHO 2005 International Health Regulations, and derogations from human rights in normal times as well as during states of emergency. The second part of the paper sets out a theoretical framework, deriving three hypotheses for why certain states declare SOE while others do not: (i) states look to their regional peers for inspiration and legitimation, leading to patterns of regional policy diffusion; (ii) newer and less robust democracies are more likely to resort to SOEs, compared with mature democracies and dictatorships; (iii) states with a higher pandemic preparedness are less likely to resort to a SOE.; ; The third and fourth parts of the paper presents data and results, respectively. The results suggest that states’ declaration of SOEs is driven by both external and internal factors. A permissive regional environment, characterized by many and simultaneously declared SOEs, may have diminished reputational and political costs, making employment of emergency powers more palatable for a wider range of governments. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, shaped governments’ decisions. Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably more likely to opt for a SOE than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness.",,,,,Political economy; Human rights; Political science; International Health Regulations; Preparedness; State of emergency; Right to health; International law; Democracy; Politics,,,,,https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3641384 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3641384,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3641384,,10.2139/ssrn.3641384,3122129753,,0,,2,true,,green
085-275-150-183-604,Innovation and Its Discontents: Pathways and Barriers in the Diffusion of Assertive Community Treatment,2019-11-04,2019,journal article,The Milbank quarterly,14680009; 0887378x,Wiley-Blackwell,United Kingdom,David A. Rochefort,"Policy Points Widespread diffusion of policy innovation is the exception rather than the rule, depending as it does on the convergence of a variety of intellectual, political, economic, and organizational forces. The history of Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) provides a compelling case study of this process while also showing how conditions may shift over time, altering the scenarios for continued program expansion. Diffusion of a program like ACT challenges government to play a nuanced role in which public endorsement and resources are used to strengthen a worthwhile service, but without suppressing flexibility and ongoing experimentation as core program values. Acceptance as a proven form of ""evidence-based practice"" is a critical element in the validation of ACT and other community mental health interventions that combine clinical and social features in novel ways. However, the use of conventional evidence-based research as a singular gold standard of program value narrows the range of stakeholder input, as well as the evaluation methodologies and forms of data deemed worthy of attention. Context Originating at the county level in Wisconsin in the early 1970s, Assertive Community Treatment is one of the most influential mental health programs ever developed. The subject of hundreds of research studies and recipient of enthusiastic backing from private advocacy organizations and government agencies, the program has spread widely across the United States and internationally as a package of resources and management techniques for supporting individuals with severe and chronic mental illness in the community. Today, however, ACT is associated with a rising tide of criticism challenging the program's practices and philosophy while alternative service models are advancing. Methods To trace the history of the Assertive Community Treatment movement, a diffusion-of-innovation framework was applied based on relevant concepts from public policy analysis, organizational behavior, implementation science, and other fields. In-depth review of the literature on ACT design, management, and performance also provided insight into the program's creation and subsequent evolution across different settings. Findings A number of factors have functioned to fuel and to constrain ACT diffusion. The former category includes policy learning through research; the role of policy entrepreneurs; ACT's acceptance as a normative standard; and a thriving international epistemic community. The latter category includes cost concerns, fidelity demands, shifting norms, research contradictions and gaps, and a multifactorial context affecting program adoption. Currently, the program stands at a crossroads, strained by the principle of adherence to a long-standing operational framework, on the one hand, and calls to adjust to an environment of changing demands and opportunities, on the other. Conclusions For nearly 50 years, Assertive Community Treatment has been a mainstay of community mental health programming in the United States and other parts of the world. This presence will continue, but not in any static sense. A growing number of hybrid and competing versions of the program are likely to develop to serve specialized clientele groups and to respond to consumer demands and the recovery paradigm in behavioral health care.",97,4,1151,1199,Policy analysis; Mental health; Evidence-based practice; Government; Health care; Political science; Stakeholder; Assertive community treatment; Epistemic community; Public relations,Assertive Community Treatment; community mental health care; community support systems; deinstitutionalization; evidence-based practice; policy diffusion; recovery model,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12429 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6904263 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6904263/ https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/innovation-and-its-discontents-pathways-and-barriers-in-the-diffusion-of-assertive-community-treatment/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31680353/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12429,31680353,10.1111/1468-0009.12429,2987557972,PMC6904263,0,000-817-821-450-823; 001-201-790-715-622; 001-490-418-957-59X; 002-671-233-762-322; 003-105-228-916-470; 003-405-025-504-067; 006-704-936-521-721; 008-267-109-949-521; 009-590-777-799-537; 011-492-278-212-845; 012-053-033-813-046; 013-199-995-806-865; 013-911-336-397-996; 016-582-240-686-827; 019-339-609-732-66X; 022-231-103-854-524; 024-794-009-054-688; 025-630-454-936-502; 028-266-497-345-009; 030-373-619-934-182; 031-216-217-070-956; 033-884-501-033-382; 034-204-905-067-858; 034-291-367-783-977; 034-568-634-023-235; 035-368-872-291-243; 043-667-892-256-867; 043-834-845-107-725; 045-928-513-909-473; 046-010-413-311-041; 046-204-327-258-876; 046-801-918-326-661; 048-297-066-162-216; 049-450-780-681-077; 049-604-223-903-588; 050-795-290-313-430; 056-213-300-304-075; 056-940-970-462-479; 062-912-839-304-060; 062-929-669-460-175; 069-025-690-842-779; 069-767-500-651-502; 073-588-842-343-527; 073-848-957-112-567; 081-083-550-738-785; 083-753-748-431-511; 084-734-001-627-543; 090-381-555-368-623; 095-441-778-051-205; 095-745-380-651-510; 100-447-916-345-778; 102-937-074-435-586; 105-221-804-390-435; 105-958-585-792-683; 112-532-809-589-736; 112-935-449-682-545; 114-232-606-724-406; 120-253-946-355-942; 125-296-386-173-623; 131-405-216-311-787; 136-664-245-893-534; 137-416-465-424-805; 141-430-086-038-707; 142-599-077-958-35X; 142-704-995-077-932; 165-486-894-782-837,13,true,,green

Policy diffusion means that policies in one unit (country, state, city, etc.) are influenced by the policies of other units. The diffusion literature conceptualises these interdependencies with four mechanisms: learning, competition, coercion and emulation. The article identifies a model of diffusion that is dominant in the diffusion literature. According to this model, policies spread because decision makers evaluate the policy implications of the actions of other units. It is argued that the role of politics remains in the background in this model, and the article shows how going beyond a narrow focus on policy adoptions helps us to consider the politics of policy diffusion more explicitly.",58,4,1245,1256,Economics; Interdependence; Coercion; State (polity); Policy transfer; Articulation (sociology); Competition (economics); Unit (housing); Economic system; Politics,,,,,https://boris.unibe.ch/141497/ https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=7096714 https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.12326 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/177197/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12326,,10.1111/1475-6765.12326,2914305915,,0,001-367-136-082-787; 002-290-868-673-180; 003-628-352-044-22X; 004-642-261-134-761; 007-696-868-566-045; 008-414-059-072-131; 008-631-552-749-08X; 008-651-558-737-563; 009-285-222-350-903; 010-238-999-857-133; 010-725-868-080-473; 011-957-020-185-592; 015-271-876-692-523; 015-701-444-535-687; 016-634-173-735-220; 016-857-978-568-376; 017-612-323-073-939; 017-928-849-887-225; 023-672-511-213-267; 025-112-618-417-304; 025-193-488-999-63X; 026-412-549-797-331; 026-591-558-832-633; 031-720-973-363-722; 033-969-989-312-301; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-746-837-546-09X; 038-790-977-968-874; 040-739-114-535-043; 042-471-303-468-159; 044-223-537-133-095; 047-799-556-360-710; 048-084-385-775-90X; 050-274-654-059-514; 051-563-283-713-00X; 051-925-465-626-092; 052-340-235-749-831; 052-747-500-010-38X; 058-071-798-060-611; 063-854-160-127-102; 064-878-640-987-438; 067-490-686-317-462; 074-465-905-471-400; 075-098-926-871-766; 076-059-834-724-990; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-490-597-322-561; 077-495-223-631-426; 077-926-704-396-107; 083-099-894-950-017; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-534-004-481-061; 101-127-387-013-017; 103-377-559-100-569; 103-856-742-498-550; 104-616-150-338-477; 112-333-966-495-520; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-677-347-760-402; 117-873-338-012-718; 118-513-543-976-791; 123-893-910-829-020; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-090-049-187-98X; 133-068-634-776-681; 137-051-141-347-832; 141-110-584-180-455; 145-428-474-771-751; 151-957-596-917-668; 155-580-858-393-517; 156-586-921-097-184; 163-976-601-636-617; 165-160-810-978-761; 174-679-244-552-770; 187-151-090-396-571; 197-541-268-876-350,70,false,,

085-736-603-243-42X,"'Thank you for Smoking!': a multi-level study on the policy impact of anti-tobacco movements, tobacco industry's countermovements and political opportunity structure on tobacco control policies in 22 European countries",,2015,dissertation,,,,,Johannes Cornelis Kuijpers,"Based on a cross- national study of 22 European countries, we conducted a multi-level assessment of the impact of societal, political and industry factors on the strictness of tobacco control legislation for the period 1980-2012. Specifically we framed tobacco control policy processes as taken place in the realm of the triad formed by the state on top and anti-tobacco movement and tobacco industry’s countermovement on both base corners. Our main question concerns the separate influence of these parties in tobacco policy processes and its resulting consequences in terms of policy outcomes. We draw on political opportunity structure (POS) theory and policy diffusion theory to assess the possibilities a political system provides for grassroots participation in policy processes. Corporate Political Action (CPA) theory is used to evaluate tobacco industry’s countemobilization efforts to impede policy reform. Finally, we draw on resource mobilization (RM) theory to indicate anti-tobacco movements abilities to impact policy processes. We found that a population’s likeliness to participate in politics negatively relates to the strictness of tobacco control policies. Potentially because policymaking processes become more complex as a multitude of grassroots interests are released on policymakers which constrains more radical policy decision-making. In accordance, we found that state’s repression of grassroots participation in politics, is positively related to the strictness of tobacco control legislation. In such case, state public health concerns or international legislative pressure, outweigh grassroots interests in policy decisions. No evidence was found that POS, and specifically the openness of political systems and the presence of allies, enabled the anti-tobacco movement and tobacco industry’s countermovement, to impact policy outcomes. Moreover, we found no evidence that tobacco industry’s countermovements impacted domestic tobacco control policies. Our main contribution are integrating state, social movement and corporate countermovement in one framework and study these parties influence on policy processes in a simultaneously manner. Moreover policy processes are complex and could only partly be explained by the multi-level factors included in our study. Clustering our data within countries, revealed that there are unobserved characteristic nested within countries that do impact the strictness of tobacco control policies but we did not control for. We encourage researchers to include more factors in our suggested triad framework and test their impact on policy processes, in order to further unravel the complex phenomena policy processes are.",,,,,Public economics; Social movement; Political science; Political opportunity; Countermovement; Tobacco control; Political system; Tobacco industry; Grassroots; Public relations; Resource mobilization,,,,,https://purl.utwente.nl/essays/67527 https://essay.utwente.nl/67527/,https://purl.utwente.nl/essays/67527,,,1859594158,,0,,0,false,,

Jakobi,"This article analyses the role of international organisations in global policy diffusion, drawing on the example of lifelong learning, a currently widely appreciated concept in education policy. I explain this success based on a sociological institutionalist framework, arguing that lifelong learning has become a global norm in education policy. For this purpose, I conduct a quantitative study of 99 countries from 1996 to 2004, showing how the idea of lifelong learning has been disseminated by international organisations and how states have reacted to this development. I first outline the theoretical framework, highlighting in particular the crucial role of international organisations. In a further step, I present the data and methods. In the third part, I analyse the activities of several international organisations on lifelong learning. In the fourth step, I show how lifelong learning has spread, distinguishing the idea of lifelong learning and reforms linked to it. Fifth, as the quantitative analysis shows, international organisations like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union can explain a large part of dissemination when it comes to the idea of lifelong learning, but reforms are more dependent on national preconditions like the wealth of a country. In the conclusions, I sum up the article's main findings and outline further research areas linked to global diffusion processes.",15,1,31,64,Lifelong learning; Norm (social); Political economy; Sociology; Development studies; European union; International political economy; International relations; Public relations; International studies; Education policy,,,,,http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jird/journal/v15/n1/abs/jird201020a.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fjird.2010.20.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Fjird.2010.20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/jird.2010.20,,10.1057/jird.2010.20,2000013982,,0,001-322-417-791-417; 002-994-504-050-869; 011-497-790-292-357; 014-359-556-843-433; 015-271-876-692-523; 015-340-230-493-134; 018-557-589-344-940; 019-664-267-521-174; 022-512-643-506-628; 027-827-119-143-849; 028-646-513-819-396; 029-333-773-751-841; 030-044-496-565-462; 031-379-991-759-927; 031-643-146-545-980; 033-051-942-885-234; 033-990-579-692-133; 034-277-783-905-290; 047-180-946-176-514; 047-860-502-496-946; 048-084-385-775-90X; 053-045-381-886-417; 055-070-798-326-463; 057-518-474-140-211; 058-028-014-085-084; 060-181-531-161-113; 060-652-895-354-512; 063-149-938-949-77X; 063-643-701-913-238; 064-190-997-753-604; 064-443-001-417-356; 070-905-249-699-458; 071-846-033-952-37X; 073-270-682-356-889; 074-465-905-471-400; 075-270-816-130-950; 083-376-965-715-560; 095-343-352-543-81X; 095-484-603-028-775; 097-591-319-695-649; 105-526-785-996-251; 107-451-773-711-844; 109-957-044-733-999; 110-897-464-603-385; 111-085-619-662-631; 115-482-499-323-938; 122-325-619-150-176; 127-515-026-171-966; 137-226-496-892-268; 139-654-243-705-704; 151-217-229-237-093; 155-721-376-179-311; 155-737-315-936-194; 164-350-015-282-053; 172-581-999-522-563; 179-758-858-672-280; 182-694-302-180-836; 188-035-998-584-503; 195-694-089-301-871; 197-384-890-021-364; 199-712-007-406-234,44,false,,

It was the government’s aim to forge a new settlement with the sector after eleven years of Liberal/National Coalition government during which contractual governance rather than relational governance was the norm. The provenance of the National Compact, launched in March 2010, can be traced back to similar framework documents for inter-sectoral cooperation in the United Kingdom (principally, The Compact) and Canada (the Accord). The National Compact) cannot be explained solely in terms of policy diffusion or the predilection of centre-right political parties for policy instruments of this sort. Rather, explanation requires a more nuanced contextual analysis of the political and policy environment within which these frameworks emerged. In this article we compare the range of factors contributing to the development of The Compact (UK), the Accord) (Canada) and the National Compact (Australia). We apply a similar analysis to policy frameworks in selected Australian states. We conclude that compacts arrive on the policy agenda via the opening of policy windows and through the actions of policy entrepreneurs. Policy windows and the attention of policy entrepreneurs might be both contextual and therefore, time-limited. We consider the range of factors that appear to have a bearing on the impact and durability of inter-sectoral policy frameworks in each jurisdiction in order to draw tentative conclusions about the prospects for the Australian National Compact.",3,2,1,44,Government; Political science; Order (exchange); Coalition government; Jurisdiction; Settlement (litigation); Public administration; Corporate governance; Context analysis; Politics,,,,,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/22714 https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/55833 https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/55833 https://espace.curtin.edu.au/bitstream/20.500.11937/54617/2/253758.pdf https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/54617 https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/npf.2012.3.issue-2/2154-3348.1038/2154-3348.1038.xml https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bpj:nonpfo:v:3:y:2012:i:2:p:44:n:1 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/nonpfo/v3y2012i2p44n1.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/2154-3348.1038,,10.1515/2154-3348.1038,1988148837,,0,,5,true,cc-by,gold

Ellis,"Why and how have Slovakia and the Czech Republic adopted flat tax policies? That is what this paper answers. This is a curious development given that flat tax policies were noticeably absent from the landscape of most of the world, including Eastern Europe. I argue that two simultaneous processes occur that make adoption viable.  First, at the domestic level, the idea of the flat tax is held in esteem by a number of actors, specifically: elite carriers, tax and financial ministers, think tanks and right-wing political parties. They champion this idea to its adoption, or at the least, introduce the flat tax into the policy-making apparatus. Second, at the international level, policy diffusion of the flat tax takes place. In other words, the experience of previous adopters impacts the decisions of future adopters. Examining both cognitive heuristics theory and rational learning I argue that there are “varieties of diffusion” during the diffusion of the flat tax.",5,1,24,50,Value-added tax; Economics; Flat tax; Champion; Market economy; Double taxation; Tax avoidance; Tax reform; International taxation; Economic system; State income tax,,,,,https://www.cejpp.eu/index.php/ojs/article/view/80 https://doaj.org/article/0a513c7bfaff4121b32c0e037178c258 https://www.cejpp.eu/index.php/ojs/article/view/80/0 https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=247891,https://www.cejpp.eu/index.php/ojs/article/view/80,,,2149187132,,0,009-285-222-350-903; 009-589-456-653-168; 011-506-457-763-495; 017-170-773-275-495; 017-848-659-469-399; 018-037-611-462-558; 018-303-135-974-657; 021-419-031-338-034; 031-051-426-608-991; 034-277-783-905-290; 037-795-985-384-058; 039-318-000-420-191; 053-185-408-328-840; 054-093-185-680-932; 057-016-417-144-064; 063-154-561-868-334; 065-423-746-506-124; 066-141-735-734-026; 071-306-624-372-513; 074-047-340-228-240; 075-447-013-517-458; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 081-731-800-117-491; 086-360-527-581-868; 088-260-998-050-582; 093-190-746-631-057; 095-484-603-028-775; 098-775-297-726-573; 101-127-387-013-017; 107-768-573-462-48X; 112-334-115-056-954; 114-190-464-534-718; 115-096-759-366-489; 118-228-879-101-371; 118-767-489-920-542; 123-509-771-179-953; 123-635-884-623-579; 126-125-111-968-03X; 129-335-961-741-581; 133-087-716-464-773; 137-149-220-755-098; 139-586-435-659-042; 142-194-939-269-449; 145-597-789-135-634; 148-204-889-184-408; 151-248-813-226-299; 155-543-653-784-650; 162-693-200-614-699; 163-522-550-423-331; 166-211-762-092-520; 169-571-769-586-572; 175-896-839-425-022; 179-546-915-291-536; 188-144-058-186-604,0,true,cc-by,gold

086-967-374-811-028,International diffusion and response : the social dimension of the EU-China relationship,,2015,dissertation,,,,,Hang Yuan,"The studies of political science and social policy have a strong tradition of analyzing the role of developed countries and the organizations like the European Union (EU) in shaping international diffusion of social policy. However, in-depth research focusing on the response of developing and emerging countries, in particular China, is lacking. Therefore, this dissertation presents an original analysis of the involvement of EU and China in bilateral and international social policy diffusion/transfer. It highlights the relational nature of the normative power Europe (NPE) and the impact of the recipient country China on the NPE. The dissertation conceptualizes the response of recipient countries to international diffusion and develops a typological framework of it. The dissertation refines the existing theoretical framework of policy learning by highlighting the complexity of learning through trial-and-error processes. It also illustrates the usefulness of careful case study design and content analysis in researching bilateral relations and refining the conceptual and theoretical frameworks of international diffusion.; The analysis of the social dimension of the EU-China relations indicates that the EU’s mixed approaches combine pragmatic and normative concerns. The typological framework of the variability of response (VOR) introduced and developed in this dissertation is more capable of mapping China’s mixed response than the existing linear conceptual frameworks. China’s learning from European expertise in social security since late 1990s results from its reflections on the undesirable social consequences of neoliberal-oriented reforms since 1970s and has been reinforced by its successful cooperation with the EU in the past decade. The labour provisions travelling though free trade agreements from the EU has been restrained by some recipient countries including China. The findings unveil the complexity of the social dimension of the EU-China relationship due to each party’s mixed approaches. The findings indicate that the others’ positive perceptions of the EU are crucial for the success of the NPE. The dissertation accentuates complex causality in international diffusion including policy learning, which requires better understanding by taking different causal factors into consideration and refining existing theoretical frameworks including typological theories.",,,,,Emerging markets; Conceptual framework; Political science; Social policy; China; Social security; European union; Free trade; Normative; Development economics; Economic system,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7005708/file/7005714.pdf https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7005708,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7005708,,,2291621154,,0,,0,false,,
087-560-586-526-28X,Gender equality policy and gender mainstreaming in Irish Aid: From diffusion to dilution to disappearance,2013-01-01,2013,journal article,Irish Studies in International Affairs,03321460; 20090072,Project Muse,Ireland,Niamh Reilly,"This article offers a critical analysis of Irish Aid's treatment of gender equality and gender mainstreaming. Informed by key concepts in policy process and feminist scholarship, it examines the evidence of Irish Aid's progress in this area. The author finds that gender equality has low salience in Irish Aid and a record of weak implementation. It is argued that while the adoption of a gender equality policy in Irish Aid reflects global policy diffusion, Ireland's rhetorical endorsement of gender equality in international affairs stems chiefly from an instrumental interest in the reputational gains it can offer and is indicative of the exercise of 'soft coercion' rather than of a principled interest in achieving gender equality. The weakness of state feminism in Ireland and the weak links between officials and women's movement actors are also factors. Further, while the disadvantage of low salience can be offset by the presence of effective 'policy entrepreneurs' using discretionary power to augment resources, this is not evident in Irish Aid in the case of the gender equality policy. Furthermore, the rising paradigm of 'managing for development results' poses new challenges to rights-based approaches to development, including gender mainstreaming. For these reasons, the gender equality policy in Irish Aid is at risk of continued dilution and perhaps disappearance.",24,-1,237,257,Salience (language); Political science; Disadvantage; Scholarship; State feminism; Irish; Gender mainstreaming; International relations; Development economics; International development,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/42912421 https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/bitstream/10379/15621/4/Reilly-2013-Gender_Equality_Policy_and_Gender_Mainstreaming_in_Irish_Aid_%28ISIA_24%29-early_version.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.3318/isia.2013.24.9 http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/isia.2013.24.9 https://core.ac.uk/download/267805065.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/isia.2013.24.9,,10.3318/isia.2013.24.9,2320548306,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc-nd,green

Feiock,"Purpose – This paper aims to examine state adoption of climate action plans (CAPs) and investigates the factors driving the adoption of these climate policies in the states. Design/methodology/approach – The framework that is formulated to explain the state climate actions involves four dimensions: climate risks, climate politics, climate economic and climate policy diffusions. These hypotheses are tested with event history analysis on a panel data set on 48 US continental states from 1994 to 2008. Findings – This paper found empirical evidence to support climate politics, economics and policy diffusion explanations. It also found that climate risks are not taken into account in states’ climate actions. A comparison is conducted to compare the differences in state and local climate policymaking. Originality/value – The paper investigates the motivations of state governments in adopting CAPs, and makes comparisons with local climate strategies.

The thesis sets out to explain whether policy convergence has occurred and the possible explanations connected with it. It is stated that 15 out of 25 EU Member States had introduced or decided to introduce smoke-free restaurants and bars up to April, 2006. Out of all the countries in the world, 35, including the EU Member States, had introduced or decided to introduce smoke-free restaurants and bars. The result is analysed by using policy convergence theory and by putting the case in a global environment where tobacco control has become an ever more central theme for public health policy.; ; The EU Member States are different in several ways considered to be important factors for policy convergence, such as cultural, institutional and socio-economic similarities, and the conclusion is made that EU membership has been a most crucial factor for the rapidity of the policy diffusion. A limited, however tangible, convergence has occurred. The EU institutions have no formal competence on the policy area in question. Instead, transnational communication from the European Commission and the governments of the Member States has been the means through which the influence has come.",,,,,Competence (human resources); International trade; Political science; Tobacco control; Public health policy; Member states; European commission; Public administration; Global environmental analysis; Symbolic convergence theory,,,,,https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1325852/file/1325853.pdf https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/1325852,https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/1325852,,,1749951314,,0,,0,false,,

We use gun control policymaking within California to illustrate how local government characteristics, the presence of regional associations, and the establishment of interest groups may lead to policy development and diffusion.

The relational approach is especially designed to account for such processes, combining relational arguments of previous studies with contributions from anthropology, human geography, sociology and public policy theory. Following a transactional ontology, this approach conceives the locality as an open site for processes of regional, national and transnational scope. Through these processes, the locality and its policies are formed in relation to dynamics at work on other levels and in other places. This ontology can be operationalized through the concept of policy network, theories of policy diffusion, and the concept of city scale.

Lead market arguments for the export potential of eco-innovations can provide an argument for policy support for environmental niches. International policy diffusion and learning across countries on the level of niche–regime interaction can improve the legitimacy of supporting policies. We propose how eco-innovation can be framed within an integrated MLP-lead market approach. Eco-innovations address two classes of regimes (infrastructure and eco-efficiency), which are likely to follow different transition pathways. The use of indicators for lead market factors for empirically analysing the opportunities for system transformation in the MLP framework is assessed. Indicators for the lead market factors can be attributed to the MLP. However, some of the indicators are more general in nature and do only indirectly point towards system transformation towards eco-innovations.",10,,20,41,Environmental resource management; Economics; Eco-innovation; Lead (geology); Transition (fiction); International policy; System transformation; Argument; Industrial organization; Legitimacy; Sustainability,,,,Germany Ministry of Education and Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210422413000944 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210422413000944 https://core.ac.uk/display/82825223,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2013.12.004,,10.1016/j.eist.2013.12.004,1986861763,,0,002-977-896-315-365; 008-497-367-521-548; 009-231-355-183-631; 009-893-259-296-866; 011-120-134-686-665; 011-453-841-242-137; 015-138-192-758-832; 015-251-775-791-516; 016-467-248-543-325; 016-760-210-921-370; 018-366-120-517-558; 020-955-929-008-907; 021-266-304-835-665; 021-494-458-567-223; 024-261-836-866-805; 024-770-754-770-979; 028-716-551-245-89X; 029-664-721-913-569; 030-489-105-070-65X; 030-883-868-650-623; 032-283-105-118-130; 034-692-979-960-652; 036-059-729-508-89X; 040-002-949-730-721; 040-117-023-931-503; 043-810-319-055-551; 048-857-136-508-941; 053-307-973-148-247; 054-742-004-227-715; 056-216-969-874-380; 060-739-571-510-226; 061-491-363-438-813; 062-586-162-675-490; 063-170-528-019-904; 068-259-085-977-283; 068-500-117-986-087; 069-768-228-605-80X; 069-792-702-484-233; 070-039-824-773-995; 075-137-503-060-83X; 076-152-196-587-931; 085-149-832-475-041; 086-436-455-410-282; 087-724-027-160-996; 087-939-942-222-60X; 090-491-221-614-123; 094-653-638-103-69X; 103-571-421-701-723; 109-660-742-113-749; 111-481-830-551-499; 113-324-253-036-043; 114-410-567-464-603; 116-665-420-292-883; 122-289-228-815-868; 130-204-732-988-818; 130-663-829-859-062; 136-344-456-963-691; 144-316-790-427-925; 151-097-054-357-603; 154-976-454-698-191; 163-108-674-509-299; 167-259-755-475-83X; 177-943-630-081-769; 193-143-616-761-105; 198-673-887-586-329,32,true,cc-by-nc-sa,hybrid

R. Oakley,"Objectives. This study combines theories on agenda setting, policy innovation, and policy learning to develop an improved model of state policy change. The case of fetal killing policy change in the states is used to develop a model that incorporates national media attention and the decisions of state courts, in addition to policy learning variables that account for the policy changes of neighboring states and the passage of time.; ; ; ; Methods. I test the effect of national media attention, decisions by the courts, and the actions of neighboring states on the likelihood that states will change their fetal homicide policies. Using time-series cross-sectional data from 1970 to 2002, the model is tested using logistic regression analysis. In addition to testing the theories mentioned above, control variables in the model include citizen and government ideology and the percentage of state residents who are fundamentalist Protestants.; ; ; ; Results. Three of the four research hypotheses are supported by the statistical analysis. The results demonstrate that increased media attention to fetal homicide in a given year increases the likelihood that a state will change its policy the next year. Support is also found for the hypothesis that state court decisions will affect policy change. One of the control variables, government liberalism, is also found to decrease the likelihood that states will change their fetal homicide policies.; ; ; ; Conclusions. This study lends insight into why states change their policies by including agenda-setting variables such as media attention and decisions made by the courts. States do react to the actions of the courts by making changes to policies affected by the decisions.",90,1,164,178,Public economics; Judicial opinion; Public policy; Policy analysis; Government; Economics; Foreign policy analysis; Policy studies; Poison control; Public administration; Education policy,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00609.x https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bla:socsci:v:90:y:2009:i:1:p:164-178 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/socsci/v90y2009i1p164-178.html http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00609.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00609.x,,10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00609.x,2066895891,,0,000-882-398-389-316; 005-261-328-376-894; 045-553-054-284-68X; 076-240-693-922-091; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 131-900-393-723-959; 148-460-439-813-652; 151-816-975-549-712; 178-352-125-937-759; 186-661-322-517-779,12,false,,

It argues against explanations which stress unilaterally the role of external actors and shows the limitations of approaches based on diffusion models in which the actor’s choice space is not examined. It argues that domestic factors are crucial in determining the outcomes of policy-diffusion processes. Although current policy ideas and models are important, the extent to which they are influential and shape concrete policy choices are primarily determined by domestic political institutions and pathdependent domestic factors. Ideas and policy paradigms provide a possibility set for an institutionally and path-dependent constrained choice. Drawing on a case study of the diffusion of the reform model advocated by the World Bank, the article argues that Brazil’s non-reform can be best explained by path dependency and by t...",25,3,320,341,Public economics; Positive economics; Economics; Set (psychology); Convergence (economics); Space (commercial competition); Pension; Path dependency; Diffusion (acoustics); Global environmental analysis; Politics,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1601670 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0192512104043019 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512104043019 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192512104043019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0192512104043019,,10.1177/0192512104043019,2329373135,,0,001-465-071-220-964; 003-102-506-571-342; 004-988-416-775-79X; 005-422-051-250-176; 008-185-467-423-213; 009-666-640-958-021; 026-680-488-354-30X; 027-827-119-143-849; 031-638-936-885-828; 032-235-898-751-342; 036-159-702-886-637; 039-318-000-420-191; 041-217-138-998-606; 050-187-879-123-710; 050-274-654-059-514; 052-723-818-069-06X; 058-081-297-715-033; 059-826-978-896-677; 061-260-406-161-693; 065-214-102-471-762; 083-331-359-969-676; 087-562-382-423-931; 097-453-106-269-982; 101-156-814-399-173; 103-374-234-231-073; 107-605-926-265-849; 115-482-499-323-938; 128-150-266-973-359; 135-658-426-949-640; 173-567-809-531-297,18,false,,

Why do many diverse countries adopt similar changes? Focusing on the spread of Chilean-style pension privatization in Latin America, this article assesses the relative merit of four theoretical explanations that scholars of diffusion have proposed. As the principal mechanism driving innovations' spread, these approaches emphasize external pressures, emanating especially from international financial institutions; the quest for symbolic or normative legitimacy; rational learning and cost-benefit calculation; and cognitive heuristics, respectively. The article assesses which one of these frameworks can best account for the three distinctive features of diffusion, namely its wavelike temporal pattern; its geographical clustering; and the spread of similarity amid diversity. While several approaches contribute to understanding policy diffusion, the analysis suggests that the cognitive-psychological framework offers a particularly persuasive account of the spread of pension reform.",57,2,262,295,Public economics; Positive economics; Latin Americans; Economics; Similarity (psychology); Diversity (business); Pension; Cognitive heuristics; Diffusion (acoustics); Normative; Legitimacy,,,,,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/188644 http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S004388710001769X https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S004388710001769X https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/theories-of-policy-diffusion-lessons-from-latin-american-pension-reform/35FEEB73909503EEC4A99AEB8D7B50DA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/wp.2005.0019,,10.1353/wp.2005.0019,2069696039,,0,009-703-653-980-148; 010-003-191-094-552; 011-258-149-193-742; 014-694-012-786-985; 016-511-223-130-984; 016-877-514-590-231; 020-481-980-392-113; 023-074-701-058-229; 027-152-711-597-919; 027-747-799-895-947; 029-186-959-850-541; 029-662-267-745-411; 032-164-929-841-901; 032-377-270-760-335; 034-046-551-536-459; 034-644-159-296-059; 036-143-486-380-167; 038-818-459-512-182; 040-201-411-215-105; 040-513-525-737-473; 041-077-342-413-159; 041-579-199-131-350; 043-017-630-273-451; 043-802-411-858-277; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-354-693-465-265; 051-222-115-697-201; 054-706-056-753-727; 057-371-621-536-192; 058-815-135-876-678; 061-602-896-004-937; 064-320-852-158-399; 066-055-962-674-405; 067-694-063-223-210; 069-046-835-164-327; 069-208-127-389-559; 069-615-800-693-349; 069-727-881-724-448; 070-430-647-474-637; 072-684-205-430-090; 073-270-682-356-889; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-279-330-331-820; 083-895-922-180-919; 084-787-681-556-687; 092-649-968-873-246; 095-343-352-543-81X; 096-480-287-110-651; 099-834-697-705-943; 101-111-899-958-608; 101-571-654-506-512; 103-804-660-323-269; 110-571-023-368-658; 111-820-232-181-612; 118-545-580-157-222; 125-268-617-755-543; 128-150-266-973-359; 129-543-580-966-505; 132-314-232-662-897; 133-087-716-464-773; 139-436-776-001-149; 142-031-016-296-207; 142-472-386-597-641; 161-916-694-633-062; 163-413-656-134-535; 163-637-734-144-951; 182-486-534-854-813,439,false,,

Mitchell,"ABSTRACTThis article assesses the role of mass media markets in the diffusion of antismoking legislation in the state of Missouri in the US. Testing multiple diffusion theories, this study finds that media markets can facilitate the diffusion of policies among local jurisdictions by exacerbating intercounty competition. More attention should be given to media markets when assessing policy diffusion mechanisms at the local level. Media markets can be an important source for policy information conveyance among counties over a large geographic area. Furthermore, traditional diffusion studies that rely on geographical contiguity measures may not be completely capturing the existence of diffusion by excluding media markets.",42,5,665,688,Public economics; Public policy; Diffusion (business); Economics; Legislation; Competition (economics); Geographic area; Mass media; Contiguity,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2016.1167044 https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/flgsxx/v42y2016i5p665-688.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03003930.2016.1167044,,10.1080/03003930.2016.1167044,2487505674,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 002-557-636-257-591; 005-692-270-875-15X; 012-027-098-920-994; 013-753-441-575-394; 015-591-021-271-179; 016-088-247-599-087; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-507-965-164-922; 024-374-726-113-336; 028-233-073-308-991; 030-097-046-778-291; 030-424-309-303-411; 031-540-345-426-181; 033-645-579-104-509; 033-696-549-241-393; 034-885-191-890-792; 039-664-709-632-96X; 044-958-408-877-837; 048-497-111-852-264; 048-966-725-973-22X; 049-390-214-661-846; 050-082-471-457-812; 052-841-629-671-34X; 054-263-752-462-798; 057-621-004-140-001; 057-942-706-927-05X; 058-071-798-060-611; 060-883-654-712-022; 062-989-130-038-979; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-264-304-760-006; 073-014-201-416-869; 073-166-408-788-371; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-256-123-771-451; 079-111-679-619-65X; 079-416-691-248-326; 080-595-342-315-043; 084-154-879-306-982; 085-835-075-480-379; 086-295-173-349-915; 088-919-425-365-248; 089-696-997-588-368; 096-895-399-512-668; 106-352-974-752-749; 110-283-548-015-63X; 112-071-346-721-120; 114-469-305-545-899; 118-051-957-199-44X; 140-882-984-483-643; 142-654-492-516-830; 143-779-381-672-57X; 144-284-867-936-370; 150-961-458-885-966; 170-434-705-795-740; 173-925-400-486-088; 186-994-947-508-464; 189-206-448-622-018,5,false,,

Even though regional higher education policies are developed within certain intergovernmental policy settings encompassing shared interests among states of regional groupings, they tend to travel across continents impacting other regions, sometimes in quite different contexts. In this regard, the policy travel of the Bologna process of Europe into other regions could be a very good example as one of the pioneers of higher education policy harmonisation initiative. Since its inception in 1998, the policy has managed to attract the attention of other regions, including Africa, reshaping higher education policies at national sub-regional and continental levels. Explaining similar scenarios, a considerable number of literatures on the inter-regional movement of ideas and practices in social policy has been developed over the last twenty years through various concepts including ‘policy transfer’, ‘policy diffusion’, ‘cross-national attraction’, ‘policy borrowing’ and ‘policy convergence’. This particular paper explores the notion of policy travel through the conceptions of ‘policy transfer’ and ‘policy diffusion’ and addresses the underlying question of how the Bologna process of Europe travelled to the various sub-regions of Africa.",,,43,59,Public policy; Higher education; Political economy; Political science; Social policy; Policy transfer; Higher education policy; Regionalisation; Bologna Process; International relations,,,,SC Enformation SRL,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-77407-7_4.pdf https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77407-7_4 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-77407-7_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-77407-7_4,,10.1007/978-3-319-77407-7_4,2811450512,,0,015-271-876-692-523; 018-456-620-461-481; 018-606-574-430-262; 022-512-643-506-628; 027-827-119-143-849; 032-771-012-705-064; 045-242-332-974-800; 050-274-654-059-514; 052-396-312-292-592; 064-369-619-254-082; 085-723-871-099-61X; 091-919-980-175-150; 115-482-499-323-938; 115-985-678-388-600; 120-732-619-427-986; 125-470-082-379-957,4,false,,

To cover the gap, we assemble a dataset of counties in all states for FY1970-2006 but focus on 12 states not threatened by intra-jurisdictional competition. Our empirical analyses yield evidence that a county adopts local sales tax for political and economic rationale rather than fiscal condition. Accordingly, regional diffusion has positive effects on local sales tax adoption in a county.

094-648-255-439-915,Learning from Others to Make Sense of the Law: Legal Response Policy Making in Higher Education,,2010,,,,,,David Matthew Glick,"This research explores how organizations decide how to respond to the laws that affect them. It investigates how they convert abstract legal changes into concrete policy responses. Much of the legal impact literature focuses exclusively on either on legal institutions and social outcomes, or on the dynamics within organizations. This work investigates systematic variation across organizations and issues. It analyzes the actors affected by legal changes as if they were political institutions making complex policy choices. It focuses on the importance of information and the ways in which these actors learn from others facing the same problems. It combines a theoretical model of policy diffusion and learning from others with original interview and survey data. The model points to, and emphasizes, the interdependence of policy decisions. It builds on the largely empirical diffusion literature by deriving clear predictions from straightforward micro-foundations. It yields propositions about which organizations are most likely to rely on learning from others, and who they are likely to learn from. The data, collected from colleges and universities, concern how organizations decided how to respond to legal changes in areas such as affirmative action and medical privacy. They provide support for the targeted-learning model. They suggest that other colleges and universities look to each others’ policies in systematic ways as a response to the information available to them. They do so to maximize the likelihood of making a good decision in a difficult situation. For example, the propensity to learn varies inversely with capacity, and there is less learning when other concrete policy guidance is available. By approaching legal response from this angle, the research supports a general model of policy choice under uncertainty which has applications to other political institutions, settings, and activities. It also suggests new ways of thinking about legal implementation and it has implications for those using legal strategies in pursuit of social change.",,,,,Higher education; Work (electrical); Political science; Survey data collection; Law; Social change; Medical privacy; Affirmative action; Education policy; Politics,,,,,http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dglick/DissFinal.pdf https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED513506,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED513506,,,2128795079,,0,003-592-471-884-916; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-197-858-651-50X; 008-854-755-099-767; 011-110-112-376-747; 013-535-160-555-332; 014-182-607-415-607; 014-435-905-904-110; 015-796-365-470-015; 017-049-972-469-781; 017-476-109-693-543; 019-468-253-709-055; 021-310-546-160-117; 024-850-329-245-487; 025-894-023-644-419; 027-827-119-143-849; 028-672-563-523-082; 033-020-070-398-508; 033-969-989-312-301; 034-674-667-986-678; 035-178-641-236-522; 037-295-708-652-850; 038-781-859-110-063; 039-515-181-628-508; 039-746-919-671-229; 041-691-558-092-454; 042-711-850-422-416; 045-587-309-910-554; 046-225-893-032-612; 048-332-483-331-659; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-486-926-784-117; 058-071-798-060-611; 061-762-703-388-616; 064-853-589-545-691; 067-121-006-432-261; 072-629-809-611-202; 077-945-151-328-246; 078-304-746-038-64X; 078-871-361-117-970; 088-777-016-495-497; 092-696-498-246-580; 093-190-746-631-057; 095-331-528-342-870; 102-091-938-347-764; 108-166-013-954-847; 112-333-966-495-520; 118-513-543-976-791; 118-861-737-822-02X; 119-520-676-491-749; 129-964-560-009-615; 131-070-598-577-043; 147-454-181-506-681; 151-886-075-838-504; 152-625-377-131-775; 155-058-689-869-155; 155-580-858-393-517; 158-371-797-508-955; 161-600-661-091-243; 171-093-266-236-800; 191-997-326-967-048; 197-048-609-953-328,1,false,,

It forms part of a broader trend of countries enacting overarching national framework climate change legislation, with the UK Climate Change Act of 2008 considered to be the pioneering legislation. This article seeks to answer two questions. First, to what extent did Irish policy-makers and other stakeholders draw explicitly on the example of the UK Climate Change Act in developing the Irish climate law? Second, to what extent was the development of the climate law in Ireland characterised by convergence towards the UK Climate Change Act, and how can we explain the observed level of convergence? Using a framework drawn from policy diffusion studies, the article argues that the development of Irish climate legislation can be characterised as partial policy diffusion from UK.

Trandel,"We study the dynamics of policy diffusion when a first-moving jurisdiction that legalizes an activity reduces the probability of legalization in nearby later-acting jurisdictions. If a jurisdiction’s firms can sell to neighboring residents, but if the good is competitively sold at every location, then policies converge: all jurisdictions legalize or all jurisdictions ban. If firms have some market power, and if the location of firms depends on the order of legalization, an early-adopting government may legalize, but an otherwise identical, but later-acting, neighboring government might not. This possible asymmetry is due to state dependence resulting from the initial distribution of firms following the first-mover’s legalization. Empirically, counties that legalize the sale of fireworks first have more firework vendors just inside their border than counties that legalize later. Furthermore, counties have a longer duration to legalize fireworks if nearby counties have already adopted. State dependence resulting from a first-mover advantage contributes to the policy divergence of regulatory policies.",,,,,Business; Government; Externality; Order (exchange); International economics; Market power; Jurisdiction; Legalization; Fireworks; Duration (project management),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_7867.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_7867.html,,,3121703488,,0,,0,false,,

The study describes the policy diffusion, which adopted the mechanisms of learning and emulation, and proposes a theoretical model. The literature reviewed associates the debate on judicial policies, specialization of courts, and public policy diffusion. Specialization of state courts was implemented in Brazil in four different waves throughout the period between the edition of the National Council of Justice Recommendation in 2006, until nowadays. The specialization of courts in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil was carried out to fight organized crime related to drug trafficking and criminal groups. The most recent wave originated as an outcome of the corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, apparently associated with political and economic corruption in the Southeast, Central-West, and South regions of the country.",5,2,24,51,Public policy; Economic Justice; Political science; Corruption; Organised crime; State (polity); Specialization (functional); Drug trafficking; Public administration; Politics,,,,,http://www.sbsociologia.com.br/sid/index.php/sid/article/view/sid.v5i2.111 http://www.sbsociologia.com.br/sid/index.php/sid/article/download/sid.v5i2.111/Madeira%20et%20al. https://lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/220169,http://www.sbsociologia.com.br/sid/index.php/sid/article/view/sid.v5i2.111,,,3123921723,,0,,0,false,,

While leaders often claim responses are based on the best available advice from scientists and public health experts, recent policy diffusion research suggests that countries are emulating the COVID-19 policies of their neighbors instead of responding to domestic conditions. Political and geographic considerations play a role in determining which countries imitate one another, but even among countries that are politically or geographically distant, nationalist regimes seem to favor certain approaches towards the pandemic. We investigate why this is the case by examining whether countries that embrace a nationalist ideology are more likely to emulate the COVID-19 policies of similarly nationalist regimes. We demonstrate that, even after controlling for domestic circumstances and linguistic, trade, geographic, and political connections, nationalist countries are emulating each other’s responses. These results are robust and shed light not only on new mechanisms of policy diffusion but also on the growing international cooperation of nationalist regimes and leaders.",,,,,Public policy; Political economy; Government; Ideology; Political science; Globe; Flattery; Nationalism; Pandemic; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3694677,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3694677,,,3125612892,,0,,0,false,,

Focusing on a case with a high degree of programmatic similarities, this contribution fills this gap by analyzing the adoptive process in an industrialized country. The empirical analysis involves the transfer and diffusion of the Swedish pension reform in Norway. Norway has a long history of borrowing from Sweden. Following a highly publicized Swedish pension reform embraced by the World Bank, Norwegian policy makers could have easily introduced this reform at home when they embarked into a reform process in the early 2000s. By analyzing core policy instruments of the Swedish pension reform and the agenda-setting and the formulation stages in the policy process in the Norwegian case, this contribution explains why it proves complex and difficult to attribute the outcome of a reform to a diffuser and it argues that more attention is needed on the process behind the adoption of policies from abroad.",50,3,427,448,Economic policy; Policy analysis; Developed country; Economics; Policy transfer; Pension; Norwegian; Economic system; Politics,,,,Canada Research Chairs (CA),https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/policy/v50y2017i3d10.1007_s11077-016-9269-6.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11077-016-9269-6.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-016-9269-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11077-016-9269-6,,10.1007/s11077-016-9269-6,2567684746,,0,001-543-715-351-46X; 001-680-728-136-84X; 003-767-544-389-134; 004-127-325-413-385; 004-870-676-018-804; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-106-338-978-676; 012-562-267-270-940; 013-803-459-482-463; 015-342-711-843-800; 020-889-023-546-562; 021-284-073-298-397; 021-419-031-338-034; 023-144-910-369-091; 026-664-820-400-225; 029-694-779-807-168; 030-228-826-085-928; 035-762-699-112-154; 036-223-524-757-034; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-359-187-987-283; 038-818-459-512-182; 039-318-000-420-191; 047-680-544-466-018; 047-812-993-541-791; 050-274-654-059-514; 051-608-597-124-183; 052-656-907-476-049; 058-071-798-060-611; 061-308-647-817-198; 063-504-944-027-038; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-428-985-427-413; 069-432-140-149-994; 070-360-301-711-438; 074-153-290-031-683; 074-591-312-235-434; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-781-417-674-679; 077-926-704-396-107; 081-118-035-104-953; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-567-154-825-257; 095-355-525-225-94X; 095-421-061-786-644; 097-619-405-643-951; 098-353-841-797-309; 099-369-848-922-486; 104-388-940-143-621; 107-572-149-436-667; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 120-521-444-245-979; 120-610-824-268-907; 121-699-289-709-271; 125-268-617-755-543; 130-493-662-199-189; 130-505-930-216-578; 133-694-723-198-818; 146-841-948-489-850; 148-460-439-813-652; 149-915-536-660-103; 160-491-857-581-184; 173-196-196-966-617; 176-032-498-639-900; 179-852-785-824-255; 184-638-759-472-325; 195-728-488-677-772,3,false,,

Berry,"This chapter reviews the dominant theories of government innovation in the public policy literature. It shows that these theories borrow heavily from others developed to explain innovative behavior by individuals: teachers using a new method of instruction, farmers adopting hybrid seeds and fertilizers, and consumers purchasing new products. The chapter explores that theories of government innovation share many commonalities with models that seek to explain organizational innovation. It deals with separate discussions of the central features of internal determinants and diffusion explanations for the adoption of a policy. The chapter explains three models that dominated early scholarship on policy innovation such as the national interaction model, the regional diffusion model and the leader-laggard model. It presents a model of American state lottery adoptions reflecting the simultaneous effects of both internal determinants and policy diffusion on state adoption behavior and employed event history analysis to test their model.",,,223,260,Public economics; Public policy; Diffusion (business); Government; Economics; State (polity); Lottery; Scholarship; Purchasing; Organizational innovation,,,,,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429494284-8/innovation-diffusion-models-policy-research-frances-stokes-berry-william-berry https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780429494284/chapters/10.4324/9780429494284-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780367274689-8,,10.4324/9780367274689-8,193139145,,0,090-016-236-512-944; 106-164-929-775-054,145,false,,

First, conceptualization of policy diffusion is considered a task completed by the first two “generations”. Second, the work of the second generation is located against the background of globalization, democratization and the trend towards the adoption of market instruments. And, third, methodological sophistication is equated with the development of large-n empirical methodologies. Each of these features is discussed in turn. We argue that diffusion studies remain seriously hindered by a lack of clarity about the dependent variable under examination; second, that the peculiar interest of the second generation in measuring the impact of large scale diffusion mechanisms such as democratization, globalization and market orientation has led to an unfortunate focus on the adoption of particular instruments and “settings” as the sole indicators of diffus...",10,4,385,402,Economy; Macroeconomics; Economics; Sophistication; Democratization; Globalization; Variables; CLARITY; Market orientation; Scale (social sciences); Conceptualization,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/13876980802468816 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13876980802468816,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13876980802468816,,10.1080/13876980802468816,2022747061,,0,000-877-035-407-996; 002-777-232-926-984; 004-379-868-674-339; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-722-686-316-360; 006-792-832-567-680; 007-523-728-807-649; 008-180-005-498-322; 008-713-130-629-634; 011-410-137-587-211; 013-185-831-653-789; 014-211-067-865-438; 015-674-536-250-207; 017-488-958-070-437; 018-313-256-596-532; 019-042-329-041-816; 019-426-014-162-034; 019-898-527-342-749; 022-481-270-309-840; 024-079-647-339-888; 025-131-708-021-155; 025-225-485-143-696; 026-412-549-797-331; 032-185-623-082-423; 032-235-898-751-342; 033-276-129-038-785; 034-629-614-592-197; 035-954-250-934-779; 036-664-233-897-751; 037-319-952-106-45X; 037-649-430-227-74X; 037-659-975-906-59X; 039-313-902-427-541; 042-583-625-945-348; 042-606-441-021-270; 043-972-759-635-674; 045-852-584-872-825; 046-096-558-383-003; 046-871-834-972-803; 047-688-756-434-452; 049-327-198-078-05X; 052-336-963-263-74X; 052-723-818-069-06X; 052-727-331-224-345; 056-729-478-472-495; 058-110-266-116-353; 061-539-997-699-329; 065-028-669-318-639; 065-998-026-916-659; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-171-917-872-761; 071-236-664-000-123; 076-104-058-345-073; 077-608-034-232-58X; 077-945-151-328-246; 082-018-719-710-071; 082-376-452-622-477; 082-760-580-086-476; 085-741-557-166-780; 087-788-273-949-91X; 088-934-795-853-447; 094-681-480-344-466; 094-833-126-001-305; 095-553-703-424-00X; 096-156-212-171-009; 096-180-676-351-18X; 097-967-063-109-185; 100-051-340-849-680; 105-526-785-996-251; 107-572-149-436-667; 109-826-807-965-414; 110-142-777-510-256; 110-257-934-520-504; 110-346-717-632-248; 112-333-966-495-520; 116-570-825-868-332; 120-706-599-155-506; 120-834-946-229-992; 125-268-617-755-543; 125-466-033-448-053; 129-335-961-741-581; 131-369-150-408-264; 147-642-082-613-586; 149-703-510-585-446; 149-864-261-986-800; 154-203-737-156-005; 160-272-209-271-620; 162-097-512-618-970; 164-652-499-055-976; 167-232-072-704-533; 168-327-842-939-215; 180-864-930-572-335,36,false,,

Historically, quantitative research on global trends has focused on a single policy dimension, potentially masking the unique factors that affect the diffusion of each policy dimension independently. Using an ordered probit model to analyze new human trafficking policy data on national prosecution, prevention, and victim-protection efforts, we find that global ties and domestic interest groups matter more where international law is less defined. While prosecution, mandated by the trafficking protocol, was relatively impervious to global ties and domestic interest groups, both trafficking prevention and victim protection were associated with these factors. Our findings also suggest that fear of repercussions is not a major driver of state actions to combat trafficking — neither ratification of the protocol nor levels of US aid were associated with greater implementation of anti-trafficking measures.",,,,,Public economics; Political science; Criminal law; Globalization; Ratification; Law enforcement; Outreach; Masking (Electronic Health Record); International law; Ordered probit,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2581597 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2581597_code1066364.pdf?abstractid=2581597&mirid=1&type=2,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2581597,,,3122006519,,0,004-843-830-206-27X; 017-515-422-774-904; 024-877-372-580-045; 026-531-701-913-459; 045-471-701-564-33X; 103-532-066-907-935; 104-065-881-644-074; 128-143-792-649-027; 150-372-244-980-17X; 170-686-336-981-775,0,false,,

This article analyzes the research findings, data sources, and methodological approaches of this applied and theoretical policy research, including numerous comprehensive state tobacco policymaking studies analyzing issues such as youth access enforcement, tobacco taxes, anti-tobacco education efforts, and clean indoor air programs. Other studies have focused on individual policymaking instruments designed to address state tobacco control issues, including tort reform, tobacco listed as a cause of death on death certifcates, tobacco sampling, promotion and advertising restrictions, and fire-safe cigarettes. This wealth of research into tobacco policymaking has contributed significantly to our understanding of federalism, policy diffusion, and iron triangles and issue networks.",6,3,339,351,Public economics; Public policy; Iron triangle; Data mining; Political science; State (polity); Enforcement; Tobacco control; Federalism; Tort reform; Promotion (rank),,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/153244000600600305 https://core.ac.uk/download/215206452.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/153244000600600305,,10.1177/153244000600600305,2140995110,,0,006-234-882-494-110; 008-975-326-206-49X; 009-332-229-771-005; 010-964-498-575-003; 011-042-061-370-473; 015-199-562-551-206; 016-253-430-886-072; 017-373-137-166-642; 019-544-709-070-31X; 020-877-898-204-460; 023-418-371-753-320; 025-981-886-409-305; 026-697-623-743-756; 029-366-979-732-524; 032-694-226-254-354; 035-000-091-685-789; 038-952-819-872-278; 040-281-467-479-356; 042-668-845-278-56X; 043-352-120-729-015; 045-637-549-335-723; 046-871-694-423-705; 048-831-652-920-70X; 052-268-979-479-48X; 053-585-146-010-279; 054-917-172-837-602; 055-824-584-389-256; 059-089-838-300-379; 059-431-435-680-507; 062-371-198-544-101; 066-907-133-574-367; 072-859-033-969-736; 075-692-820-995-922; 077-688-493-278-897; 078-418-910-615-185; 092-203-049-604-110; 092-503-706-846-49X; 095-371-894-234-729; 098-068-959-753-288; 098-069-553-582-647; 098-762-332-558-999; 103-137-804-445-075; 103-603-476-152-032; 104-300-338-436-633; 115-501-521-672-52X; 126-923-507-663-028; 132-819-828-269-838; 132-901-821-528-895; 142-090-880-007-148,1,true,,green

Contrary to fears that global competition would produce a race to the bottom, there appears to be a race to the top, not only among rich countries but also among poor ones. Using econometric analysis of the adoption of automobile emission standards over the past twenty years for 129 countries, the author argues that this global diffusion results from countries’ efforts to stay competitive in the international market. Due to the pressure from importing countries that have adopted stringent emission standards, even developing countries have rapidly moved to adopt rich country standards. The evidence shows that adoption of automobile emission standards correlates with an increase in the total value of automobile exports. Under some conditions, economic incentives in a global market can be a complement to environmental protection.",65,1,1,33,Economics; International economics; Race to the bottom; Value (economics); Competition (economics); Race to the Top; Incentive; Econometric analysis; International market; Economic growth; Developing country,,,,,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/497816/figure/fig01 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/policy-diffusion-of-emission-standards-is-there-a-race-to-the-top/D96A1738EAD23072623984D7FE52FF21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0043887112000238,,10.1017/s0043887112000238,2161420834,,0,002-645-648-819-301; 009-703-967-271-926; 014-145-446-402-502; 014-719-833-896-709; 016-777-561-999-525; 017-010-933-750-388; 017-207-530-347-577; 023-512-678-969-055; 027-169-272-591-400; 029-099-267-525-603; 030-365-048-727-429; 031-489-470-658-693; 032-925-886-572-222; 035-261-961-935-32X; 039-318-000-420-191; 040-229-797-597-322; 043-714-057-974-194; 045-312-470-986-632; 046-431-892-895-448; 055-827-568-962-167; 058-071-798-060-611; 060-739-571-510-226; 071-293-782-288-122; 071-846-033-952-37X; 074-440-638-968-971; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 084-001-465-924-433; 084-105-803-745-582; 086-216-752-861-616; 088-234-707-616-496; 092-530-947-075-343; 102-014-555-515-442; 103-377-559-100-569; 108-835-553-268-27X; 108-919-766-251-496; 123-893-910-829-020; 126-062-812-255-686; 126-419-586-283-329; 128-638-621-431-095; 131-900-393-723-959; 144-188-231-594-467; 150-970-862-869-903; 159-346-836-194-525; 177-487-141-968-071; 187-666-907-019-133; 190-557-428-758-751,41,false,,

This paper conceives of European regional policy as a process of policy diffusion in which the supply side of (European) policies and the demand side of the domestic arena can be linked in different ways. The paper will present, firstly, an analysis of the opportunity structures European regional policies provide for domestic actors; and, secondly, a typology of different domestic constellations which lead to a different use of European policies. The empirical cases of eastern Germany and southern Italy, two of the most important underdeveloped areas in western Europe, demonstrate that the use of European policies for the empowerment of the regions and for a transformation of policies and polity are two of the possible results of the impact of European regional policy, but they are bound to very specific domestic preconditions.",3,,71,95,Empirical research; Economy; Regional science; Political science; European studies; European integration; Network governance; Regional policy; Opportunity structures; Polity; Corporate governance,,,,,http://journals.aau.dk/index.php/ijis/article/view/187 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/229012084.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5278/ojs.ijis.v3i0.187,,10.5278/ojs.ijis.v3i0.187,2343845461,,0,,0,true,,

Haider-Markel,"In 1996, more than half of the states considered legislation banning same-sex marriages. This article examines these events as a geographic expansion of the scope of the conflict rather than as traditional state-centered policy innovation. I argue that the diffusion of same-sex marriage bans was determined by the organized efforts of advocacy coalitions and internal state characteristics rather than by regional diffusion or communication among policy experts. I use state-level data collected from activists, media accounts, and official sources to establish the organized efforts to ban same-sex marriage. I then develop and empirically test a model of policy diffusion to predict both state consideration and adoption of policies banning same-sex marriage. The findings suggest that the diffusion of these policies is best explained by the presence of an organized national campaign by conservative religious groups, the local resources of interest groups, and other internal state characteristics rather than by regional diffusion patterns. I also find that the influence of state characteristics may vary during the policymaking process.",1,1,5,26,Diffusion (business); Political economy; Political science; State (polity); Legislation; Test (assessment); Scope (project management); Same sex; Public relations; Politics,,,,,http://spa.sagepub.com/content/1/1/5.abstract http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/153244000100100102 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/policy-diffusion-as-a-geographical-expansion-of-the-scope-of-political-conflict-samesex-marriage-bans-in-the-1990s/EB154464907C09267CCCEF7629D05F96 https://www.jstor.org/stable/40421412 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/153244000100100102,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/153244000100100102,,10.1177/153244000100100102,2323848371,,0,001-500-207-423-316; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-966-329-404-965; 008-180-005-498-322; 014-694-012-786-985; 015-591-021-271-179; 017-277-944-387-775; 018-769-346-177-716; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-475-024-189-309; 026-344-391-898-21X; 032-164-929-841-901; 034-602-347-957-269; 036-471-831-569-386; 036-961-749-635-681; 046-871-834-972-803; 047-558-081-081-541; 058-694-414-758-078; 060-896-115-101-479; 065-661-698-376-559; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-781-823-105-391; 070-829-451-787-361; 071-361-180-414-699; 073-985-912-113-778; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-544-962-568-939; 084-787-681-556-687; 088-126-031-721-094; 090-289-071-624-991; 096-837-016-253-203; 097-416-968-699-086; 098-419-626-337-536; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-490-342-063-275; 104-650-834-138-838; 120-652-376-982-714; 140-903-698-141-79X; 161-381-015-129-326; 175-162-941-666-655; 178-366-044-276-810; 181-273-172-374-410; 183-079-321-581-821; 183-331-587-329-801,147,false,,

Second, conditions of global agenda setting and policy diffusion are presented; building up a model of global policy development, a frame in which the worldwide spread of global public policy can be analyzed. Third, I present a case study of global policy development, namely the rise of ‘lifelong learning’ as part of current education policy.

Parinandi,"Over the last twenty years, a range of studies have been undertaken to evaluate whether states engage in a ‘race to the bottom’ (RTB) in the provision of welfare services. Many of these studies have primarily used spatial lags to prove/disprove the existence of RTB and have painted RTB as a continuous, linear process where welfare services approach a minimal limit. Here, I re-conceptualize RTB in the context of local political determinants and use geographically weighted regression to determine whether RTB can occur in locally specific settings but not in a global geographic space. I find that RTB is a much more local process than was previously thought and also find that much of what we consider to be RTB took place in the industrial Midwest rather than the South. Additionally, RTB is not limited to welfare benefits but can take other forms, such as restricting access. Rather than being continuous and linear, RTB is highly dynamic and influenced by local exigencies and necessities.",,,,,Public economics; Welfare; Economics; Race to the bottom; Context (language use); Geographically Weighted Regression; Linear process; Geographic space; Pressure group; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1644126,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1644126,,,1572521667,,0,,0,false,,

098-970-678-480-89X,Policy integration for sustainable development: Agenda 2030 meets Region Skåne,,2018,,,,,,Filip Lidegran,"In an effort to promote sustainable development work in Region Skane, the regional government seeks to integrate Agenda 2030 into their Regional Development Strategy (RUS). This paper compares the two policies, using qualitative content analysis to problematize the prospects of policy integration. Applying theories from policy integration, policy transfer and policy diffusion, the analysis covers four dimensions of policy integration: the frame, the interactive, the substantive and the motivational dimension. Key insights from the study showcase that RUS’s international character opens it to integration: both policies share a humanistic worldview, emphasize liberal market dynamics, environmental improvement, increased sciences funding and expanded infrastructure. Simultaneously, they have differing understandings on matters of openness, governance and sustainable growth. There are also substantial challenges: Agenda 2030’s qualitative indicators for sustainable development need to be concretized into the local context of Skane. Pressing deadlines regarding Agenda 2030’s environmental ambitions must be assessed according to Skane’s ability to match them. Lastly, the highly competitive character of RUS should be weighed according to what is best for sustainable development on a global level. The thesis concludes that policy integration would not resolve the imbalance between the economic, social and environmental pillars of sustainable development in Region Skane.

Conti; David K. Jones,"The ACA entails a number of provisions that are profoundly changing the way the states ensure access to medical care, including the expansion of Medicaid and the maintenance of health insurance exchanges. Here, we argue that while federal policy is the originating force of whether these provisions are adopted, individual state decisions are made within a larger ecosystem. This ecosystem has two main components: (1) complementary and competing state and federal policies; and (2) medical provision by a variety of suppliers. Specifically, the merits, costs, and uncertainties associated with adopting these provisions cannot be considered by the states in a vacuum-they may interact with a large set of simultaneously launched or existing local, state, and federal policies aimed at ensuring access to medical care. They may also interact with specific state and federal reimbursement policies and other requirements facing local hospitals and medical providers. We illustrate by example how these interactions may have important implications for the diffusion of ACA provisions. One implication of this perspective is that future empirical work on the rate, determinants, and impacts of ACA coverage expansions on individual and aggregate well-being must incorporate systematic study of this complex public-private sector ecosystem.",42,2,377,385,Public economics; Variety (cybernetics); Business; Public sector; Marketing; State (polity); Medicaid; Reimbursement; Health insurance; Federal policy; Medical care,340B drug discount program; Affordable Care Act; diffusion; insurance; medical care,"Health Insurance Exchanges; Humans; Insurance, Health; Medicaid; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Public Sector; United States",,,https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article/42/2/377/13897/Policy-Diffusion-across-Disparate-Disciplines https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28007793 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28007793,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/03616878-3766771,28007793,10.1215/03616878-3766771,2566007204,,0,015-564-631-687-696; 018-507-965-164-922; 018-769-346-177-716; 019-142-222-669-089; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-749-731-761-716; 023-641-766-450-713; 026-070-041-528-74X; 036-630-266-475-146; 040-698-329-741-815; 045-542-945-134-294; 048-267-906-218-212; 051-563-283-713-00X; 057-771-304-270-813; 058-071-798-060-611; 062-362-498-949-253; 067-020-613-560-975; 073-822-258-832-930; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-413-548-207-63X; 079-798-642-602-014; 085-054-251-145-237; 097-164-713-193-237; 098-317-151-036-205; 101-216-475-602-289; 117-961-527-536-174; 122-831-549-770-67X; 134-326-237-481-463; 154-017-833-073-649; 178-927-906-303-374,2,true,,bronze

Public policies spread through the ‘policy diffusion’ process, enabling governments to learn from another’s enacted policy solutions. The Prevention Policies Directory (the Directory), an online database of municipal, provincial/territorial, and federal cancer and chronic disease prevention policies from across Canada, was developed to facilitate the diffusion of healthy public policies and support the work of prevention researchers, practitioners, and policy specialists. Through a participatory engagement approach, this information technology solution was implemented as a communication channel or policy knowledge transfer tool. It also addressed the intrinsic shortcomings of environmental scanning for policy surveillance and monitoring. A combination of quantitative web metrics and qualitative anecdotal evidence have illustrated that the Directory is becoming an important tool for healthy public policy surveillance and policy diffusion in Canada.",6,2,e177,,Public policy; Information technology; Public health; Policy studies; Anecdotal evidence; Knowledge transfer; Directory; Online database; Public relations; Medicine,cancer prevention; chronic disease prevention; healthy public policy; knowledge transfer and exchange; policy diffusion; policy informatics,,,,http://ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/ojphi/article/view/5372 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4221084/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4221084 https://ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/ojphi/article/view/5372/4136 https://ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/ojphi/article/download/5372/4136 https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/ojphi/article/download/5372/4136 https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/ojphi/article/view/5372,http://dx.doi.org/10.5210/ojphi.v6i2.5372,25379125,10.5210/ojphi.v6i2.5372,2118205431,PMC4221084,0,001-328-701-270-077; 001-481-906-279-295; 003-516-758-612-673; 003-592-471-884-916; 005-692-270-875-15X; 008-860-772-189-175; 009-249-108-095-680; 027-835-981-532-333; 034-519-174-883-806; 042-823-469-793-644; 046-981-842-053-02X; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-255-920-569-979; 055-025-832-215-482; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-651-373-859-820; 064-256-681-169-910; 064-303-508-781-427; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 084-787-681-556-687; 094-331-518-356-228; 101-488-954-100-242; 102-730-017-263-708; 118-513-543-976-791; 141-097-582-918-715; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-637-734-144-951; 178-927-906-303-374; 191-090-513-096-916,5,true,publisher-specific license,gold

Initially, electric vehicles (EVs) were the most promising technology. Most large car firms developed EVs and started bringing them to the market, in limited numbers. Yet, car firms halted their EV engagement around 2001 and focused on hybrid vehicles (HVs) and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) instead. Hybrids found their way into the product portfolios of most car manufacturers while FCVs failed to gain traction. In 2006, car firms again committed to EVs, and on a larger scale. To better understand recurring waves of firms’ low-emission-vehicle investments in the international context, this paper explores the influence of geographically-bound government policies on car firms’ innovation strategies. An analysis of archival data from 1997 to 2010 details LEV-specific developments per region/firm, and shows the complex interplay between policies on local, national and international levels and firms’ strategies. Three mechanisms seem to shape the international LEV trajectory: (1) international policy diffusion (vertically and horizontally), (2) firms’ international operations, (3) fit between policy requirements and firm capabilities. Heeding the call for a better geographical conceptualization of technological trajectories, this paper also proposes a framework that explains co-evolution between government policies and car manufacturers.",,,,,Public policy; Product (category theory); Economics; Marketing; Archival research; Context (language use); International policy; Industrial organization; Scale (social sciences); Conceptualization; Low emission vehicle,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/74103227 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2622214 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2622214_code105013.pdf?abstractid=2622214&mirid=1 https://ssrn.com/abstract=2622214,https://core.ac.uk/display/74103227,,,2192789843,,0,113-935-290-318-181; 162-999-590-598-234,1,false,,

Considering that the common explanation of policy diffusion cannot explain all instances of isomorphism, this paper proposes an alternative way of operationalising interdependent decision-making. Drawing on emerging work in neoinstitutionalist world society theory, we suggest that the rise of global policy models can be explained by thinking of the world polity as a synchronised system in which national states keep an eye out on each others’ moves and, often, match them. As a consequence, global models are formed in parallel with their spread. We illustrate this argument by analysing the worldwide institutionalisation of national bioethics committees (NBCs). Using qualitative analysis of official documentation on NBCs, we trace how the institution has evolved into a widely recognised and codified format in four shifts – the appearanc...",2,3-4,267,290,Political economy; Sociology; Institutionalisation; Empirical evidence; Bioethics; Polity; Institution; Social science; Argument; Documentation; Isomorphism (sociology),,,,Koneen Säätiö,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23254823.2016.1147370 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23254823.2016.1147370 https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/the-construction-and-spread-of-global-models-worldwide-synchronis,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23254823.2016.1147370,,10.1080/23254823.2016.1147370,2339049687,,0,000-038-230-810-935; 005-684-419-014-439; 006-341-460-702-091; 007-832-107-722-895; 009-357-792-803-695; 009-864-320-004-699; 009-870-162-706-927; 016-857-978-568-376; 017-243-088-486-088; 019-925-000-616-329; 022-068-286-762-165; 025-421-735-902-041; 027-206-956-903-807; 030-058-436-830-348; 033-852-662-613-736; 034-748-654-743-377; 037-183-432-019-432; 037-560-691-221-45X; 038-064-710-398-327; 038-240-188-235-233; 039-301-414-998-179; 043-581-965-730-850; 043-727-123-138-569; 044-798-335-303-399; 045-969-121-870-494; 048-404-532-675-897; 050-566-600-452-876; 052-581-866-489-359; 053-175-713-733-077; 057-016-379-973-936; 060-256-541-686-662; 061-889-440-613-700; 063-149-938-949-77X; 063-592-276-066-80X; 065-557-900-220-655; 071-846-033-952-37X; 073-336-485-432-263; 077-537-463-470-88X; 077-945-151-328-246; 079-217-749-542-615; 079-863-038-288-012; 081-776-782-264-461; 083-223-312-687-016; 088-222-511-162-914; 089-548-510-856-136; 095-484-603-028-775; 099-243-916-927-243; 103-563-340-614-230; 113-741-307-551-153; 114-506-892-994-268; 117-677-347-760-402; 120-791-681-916-465; 133-557-325-104-491; 135-690-174-979-180; 136-644-294-244-145; 144-533-933-934-942; 149-056-733-736-960; 168-018-523-358-908; 178-178-431-446-631; 178-309-663-067-320; 180-505-769-529-298; 187-965-943-668-798,11,false,,

101-802-054-827-270,An Integrated Model of Legal Transplantation: The Diffusion of Intellectual Property Law in Developing Countries†,2014-12-01,2014,journal article,International Studies Quarterly,00208833; 14682478,Oxford University Press (OUP),United Kingdom,Jean-Frédéric Morin; Edward Richard Gold,"Why do some countries adopt exogenous rules into their domestic law when those rules contravene their specific interests? We draw on the policy-diffusion literature to identify four causal mechanisms that we hypothesize explain the adoption of such rules. While existing literature treats these mechanisms as independent, we argue that each works in combination with the others to facilitate legal transplantation. While one mechanism—coercion—tends to initiate the transplantation process, it fades over time and three others largely supplant it: contractualization, socialization, and regulatory competition. These mechanisms act in a mutually supportive manner. We test our claims via a quantitative analysis of legal transplants in the field of intellectual property (IP) that incorporates an original index of IP protection in 121 developing countries over more than 14 years. This article concludes with a plea for theoretical eclecticism, acknowledging multicausality and context-conditionality. Any comprehensive explanation of legal transplantation must include the identification of mutual reinforcement between causal mechanisms, rather than simply rank their relative contributions. “[Laws] should be so specific to the people for whom they are made, that it is a great coincidence if those of one nation can suit another” argued Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws (1961:295). Apparently, history is full of coincidence. Laws frequently travel across both time and space. Sections of the Code of Hammurabi, enforced in Babylonia four thousand years ago, were integrated into Persian law, made their way into Greek law, and were subsequently incorporated into Roman law (Watson 1974:22–23). The Roman legacy then inspired the European Civil Codes that include elements of the ancient text. More recently, the European Codes have served as models for legal reform in countries as diverse as Peru, Egypt, and Japan. Legal transplantation proves particularly puzzling in situations of asymmetric interests: Those in which the interests of the adopting state conflict with those of the state in which the rule originated. Why would a country adopt foreign rules that run counter to its own interests? Existing scholarship lacks adequate answers to this question. This article argues that the explanation for legal transplantation lies not in any single causal mechanism but in the succession and reinforcement of multiple mechanisms. In making this claim, we favor analytical eclecticism and answer the call of Sil and Katzenstein for “complex causal stories that forgo parsimony in order to capture the interactions among different types of causal mechanisms normally analyzed in isolation from each other within separate research traditions” (2010:412). The article proceeds in three main sections. The first draws upon legal and political scholarship to build a typology of causal mechanisms for legal transplantation.

With the importance of cities’ sustainability efforts, scholars have increasingly explored what factors motivate local governments to implement voluntary sustainability programs by focusing on internal government and community characteristics. However, what is missing in the previous discussion is whether city governments respond to sustainability efforts by other government entities, especially neighboring local governments. Drawing on institutional and policy diffusion theories, we analyzed the sustainability programs of 251 suburban cities in 66 metropolitan areas. We find that suburban cities are likely to consider sustainability efforts of central cities in the same metropolitan area when determining the extent to which they implement their sustainability programs.

Over the past decade, performance-based financing (PBF) has rapidly spread in Africa. This study explores how, through the PBF Community of Practice’s attributes, structure, and strategies, PBF diffusion was fostered in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods Informed by the diffusion entrepreneurs’ (DEs) framework dimensions, we used a mixed methods convergent design to investigate how the attributes, structure, and strategies of this community fostered the diffusion of PBF. The quantitative strand of work included firstly a semantic discourse analysis of textual data extracted from CoP’s online discussion forum (n = 1346 posts). Secondly, the relational data extracted from these 1346 forum posts was examined using social network analysis (SNA). We confronted these quantitative results with a thematic analysis of qualitative interviews (n = 40) and data extracted from the CoP’s key documentation (n = 17). Results CoP members’ attributes included: representation systems anchored in clinical and economic sciences, strong expectations that the CoP would boost professional visibility and career, and significant health systems knowledge and social resources. The CoP’s core group, dominated by high-income country (HIC) members, critically matched PBF principles to major health systems issues in Africa. The broad consensus in online PBF thematic discussions created a strong sense of community, a breeding ground for emulation among CoP members. The CoP also sought to produce and promote experiential knowledge exchanges about PBF amongst African practitioners. Findings from network analyses showed that the promoted Africa-driven community was led by HIC members, although their prominence tended to decrease with time. Conclusion This empirical research highlighted some of the constituting features, structure, and strategies of policy networks in influencing health policy diffusion. Despite good intentions to disrupt the established governance landscape, influential actors coming from HICs continued to drive the framing, and shaped health systems policy experimentation, emulation, and learning in African countries. Beyond mere knowledge exchange platforms, CoP can act as meaningful transnational policy networks pursuing the diffusion of health systems reforms, such as PBF.",10,6,310,323,Finance; Empirical research; Experiential knowledge; Framing (social sciences); Political science; Community of practice; Sense of community; Health policy; Thematic analysis; Discourse analysis,Communities of Practice; Performance-Based Financing; Semantic Analysis; Social Network Analysis; Sub-Saharan Africa; Transnational Policy Networks,"Africa South of the Sahara; Health Policy; Health Services; Healthcare Financing; Humans; Reimbursement, Incentive",,,https://www.ijhpm.com/article_3796_62424a6013cd4d214b95424a8eb3dfb2.pdf https://www.ijhpm.com/article_3796.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610754,http://dx.doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.57,32610754,10.34172/ijhpm.2020.57,3020760985,PMC9056145,0,000-203-627-584-442; 000-574-580-091-79X; 003-790-523-092-150; 005-746-378-498-65X; 008-293-510-564-74X; 008-367-857-261-624; 017-967-623-762-675; 032-500-978-799-180; 035-754-408-816-46X; 036-106-751-774-78X; 038-136-655-947-548; 042-656-804-399-607; 044-264-540-708-452; 050-011-294-391-139; 051-543-670-457-546; 051-813-102-078-422; 058-071-798-060-611; 062-045-784-363-959; 062-923-529-495-264; 063-750-934-915-190; 066-182-936-475-690; 075-094-848-103-455; 083-113-641-633-679; 090-609-558-511-657; 110-309-926-544-567; 112-944-478-565-334; 133-639-962-835-165; 134-117-393-639-030; 135-276-119-685-821; 137-598-543-807-650; 148-873-247-805-83X; 149-605-584-926-275; 159-854-362-378-437,3,true,cc-by,gold

This article examines the launching of conditional cash transfer programs by Brazilian municipalities to explore this problem. The literature of political science asserts that such programs have been widely implemented because they correspond to an alternative policy strategy adopted by governments facing opposition to implement universal public policies. So, political competition would be at the root of CCT launching. This article presents an alternative explanation. From 1995 to 2001, local governments created or emulated the Bolsa Escola Program (BEP) in all regions of the country. Sucha a path continued after the lauching of the national Bolsa Escola by the federal government. Why did some local governments decide to adopt the national BEP and others did not? To answer these questions, the research tests the influence of structural, internal and external variables on the dissemination of CCT programs. Two main hypotheses are tested. The first asserts that local political competition is positive for policy diffusion. The second hypothesis claims that party alignment between the municipal and federal levels increases the likelihood of municipalities adopting the federal BEP. The research uses Event History Analysis to test statistically the impact of political incentives on policy diffusion among Sao Paulo State's municipalities. Two types of policy diffusion are examined: horizontal and vertical. The findings confirm that political competition influences the horizontal diffusion among municipalities. Unexpectedly, vertical diffusion does not occur because of party alignment or political competition. Rather, levels of socioeconomic development drive policy emulation.",6,2,56,87,Public economics; Public policy; Law; Cash transfers; Local government; Conditional cash transfer; Opposition (politics); Incentive; Horizontal and vertical; Politics,,,,,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bpsr/v6n2/a03v6n2.pdf http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1981-38212012000200003 https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1981-38212012000200003&script=sci_arttext http://www.scielo.br/j/bpsr/a/CpZxGxHTpSryqYgLpfMQ5hz/ https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3943/394334972003.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s1981-38212012000200003,,10.1590/s1981-38212012000200003,2023451478,,0,001-016-638-553-927; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-106-338-978-676; 006-902-155-088-74X; 010-786-133-682-640; 012-533-852-579-460; 015-591-021-271-179; 016-937-048-893-746; 018-454-798-334-448; 025-826-626-668-87X; 027-128-952-167-530; 031-318-852-376-118; 033-786-486-087-286; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-373-878-461-823; 039-422-867-104-685; 039-664-709-632-96X; 050-274-654-059-514; 056-214-871-504-120; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-067-510-293-836; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-572-338-742-129; 084-154-879-306-982; 087-535-931-939-575; 088-993-237-313-315; 092-067-965-798-746; 093-190-746-631-057; 100-548-136-504-080; 111-533-042-559-328; 114-590-251-239-996; 117-677-347-760-402; 128-150-266-973-359; 129-868-939-005-475; 133-087-716-464-773; 142-739-519-814-372; 158-868-403-828-213; 158-936-603-235-254; 163-076-040-775-567; 163-637-734-144-951; 177-438-235-402-633,21,true,cc-by,gold

Wilkerson; Shaun Bevan; Gerard Breeman; Christian Breunig; Laura Chaqués; Christopher Green-Pedersen; Will Jennings; Peter John; Bryan D. Jones; David Lowery; Arco Timmermans,"In this paper, we introduce an ambitious comparative politics research program. The Comparative Agendas Project has two main purposes. The first is to bring together scholars from many nations who share an interest in developing systematic indicators of issue attention and policy outputs within their nations??? political systems. The second is to advance collaborative, comparative policy research by applying ??? to the extent feasible ??? the same set of attention and output indicators to every political system. Constructing a policy topic system that effectively captures changing issue attention within a country over many years is challenging enough. The Comparative Agendas Project seeks to develop a single topic system that effectively captures the range of issues addressed across most advanced industrialized democracies. For the first time, scholars will be able to reliably compare the attention that one country???s government devotes to an issue to the attention that issue is receiving in other countries. This measure of activity can then be used to test longstanding questions about agenda setting, institutional design, and policy diffusion, among others.The starting point is the Policy Agendas Project originally developed by Baumgartner and Jones for the U.S. (www.policyagendas.org). This system assigns a single label to each event at two levels of discrimination for a total of 19 major topics and 224 subtopics. In the U.S., this topic coding system has been applied to legislative, judicial, executive, and media activities from the Second World War to the present, encompassing nearly one million events in all. Other individual country projects such as that of Denmark are also now well developed, and are generating papers and publications that shed new light on the evolution of politics within particular countries, as well as allowing for the study of broader political science questions (John & Margetts, 2003; Breunig, Green-Pedersen & Mortensen, 2005; Baumgartner and Jones 2006). This paper uses this new system to begin to compare issue attention across six of these countries. We focus on just one form of activity, the production of laws, during a limited time period, 1990-2003. Our goal is to introduce this and begin to investigate some of the comparative questions that these data allow us new approach, discuss some of the unique methodological challenges involved, and introduce three general methods for comparing policymaking patterns across countries. We do not draw any firm conclusions about lawmaking similarities and differences across these systems ??? to do so would be premature for reasons discussed below.",,,,,Government; Political science; Productivity; Research program; Lawmaking; Political system; Public relations; Management science; Comparative politics; Legislature; Politics,,,,,http://www.unc.edu/%7Efbaum/papers/ECPR_2008_Laws.pdf https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/legislative-productivity-in-comparative-perspective-an-introduction-to-the-comparative-agendas-project(ae27b0e4-3624-489e-b564-57bcaf312916).html https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:80308,http://www.unc.edu/%7Efbaum/papers/ECPR_2008_Laws.pdf,,,2510571471,,0,005-439-868-038-998; 012-612-779-600-897; 052-216-675-145-283; 078-089-832-143-201; 078-441-911-862-431; 096-895-399-512-668; 102-530-163-295-47X; 141-717-322-711-894; 176-640-540-551-515; 183-390-520-651-417,3,false,,

While leaders often claim responses are based on the best available advice from scientists and public health experts, recent policy diffusion research suggests that countries are emulating the COVID-19 policies of their neighbors instead of responding to domestic conditions. Political and geographic considerations play a role in determining which countries imitate one another, but even among countries that are politically or geographically distant, nationalist regimes seem to favor certain approaches towards the pandemic. We investigate why this is the case by examining whether countries that embrace a nationalist ideology are more likely to emulate the COVID-19 policies of similarly nationalist regimes. We demonstrate that, even after controlling for domestic circumstances and linguistic, trade, geographic, and political connections, nationalist countries are emulating each other's responses. These results are robust and shed light not only on new mechanisms of policy diffusion but also on the growing international cooperation of nationalist regimes and leaders.",26,1,1,22,Political economy; Government; Ideology; Political science; Globe; Flattery; Nationalism; Panel data; Pandemic; Politics,COVID-19; Coronavirus; Nationalism; Pandemic; Panel data; Policy diffusion,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132688 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11366-020-09702-7/tables/1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11366-020-09702-7.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33132688/ https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5989&context=facpubs https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/facpubs/4835/ https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7584404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11366-020-09702-7,33132688,10.1007/s11366-020-09702-7,3092698806,PMC7584404,0,004-110-957-593-192; 006-282-272-395-98X; 013-731-270-122-755; 014-580-410-907-88X; 014-694-012-786-985; 018-454-798-334-448; 021-456-617-181-866; 022-303-939-580-092; 027-475-395-959-514; 031-321-563-518-279; 035-140-806-849-359; 036-661-319-308-619; 037-093-910-834-572; 038-137-345-592-926; 041-498-232-392-874; 047-100-096-242-649; 047-385-352-717-976; 052-780-578-940-987; 056-486-429-067-596; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-668-244-624-560; 060-881-928-065-821; 061-793-046-506-062; 062-338-272-345-545; 062-849-708-836-500; 064-296-699-251-37X; 070-439-295-045-214; 072-100-996-697-047; 073-192-785-131-729; 074-254-394-170-189; 076-777-723-036-470; 080-544-706-827-876; 083-229-103-568-341; 084-787-681-556-687; 087-972-672-842-60X; 089-224-504-410-76X; 093-625-230-192-508; 096-397-544-324-638; 100-338-387-041-898; 101-488-954-100-242; 104-322-059-448-145; 108-263-128-627-517; 108-975-910-572-777; 109-005-040-311-328; 123-117-445-164-323; 129-512-614-893-104; 131-900-393-723-959; 137-185-324-044-387; 140-708-002-284-458; 150-372-244-980-17X; 155-580-858-393-517; 162-022-517-054-960,10,true,,green

Mooney,"In 1969, political scientist Jack Walker published 'The Diffusion of Innovations among the American States' in the American Political Science Review. 'Walker 1969' has since become a cornerstone of political science, packed with ideas, conjectures, and suggestions that spawned multiple lines of research in multiple fields. In good Kuhnian fashion, Walker 1969 is important less for the answers it provides than for the questions it raises, inspiring generations of political scientists to use the political, institutional, and policy differences among the states to understand policymaking better. Walker 1969 is the rock on which the modern subfield of state politics scholarship was built, in addition to inspiring copious research into federalism, comparative politics, and international relations. This Element documents the deep and extensive impact of Walker 1969 on the study of policymaking in the US states. In the process, it organizes and analyzes that literature, demonstrating its progress and promise.",,,,,Political science; Law and economics; Element (criminal law); Scholarship; Cornerstone; Diffusion of innovations;

The implications of the recent Hartz reforms for the German welfare state,,2005,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Achim Kemmerling; Oliver Bruttel,"The twin predicaments of German labour market performance and welfare state performance triggered an ongoing debate on reforming the German model. Recently, this debate has yielded an outcome in the form of the so-called Hartz laws, a bundle of labour market policies aimed at the reduction of unemployment and the decrease of non-wage labour costs. The Hartz reforms have played a prominent role in the public discussion, but are they really a watershed as both optimists and pessimists claim? In this article we argue that the Hartz reform is one of the most ambitious German reform projects since World War II, and embed it in an international context. We discuss three views of policy reform: reform as a process of policy-learning, as a process of competitive realignment and as a process of reinforcing path dependence. We show which of the three paradigms accounts for what part of the political result. We find evidence for both policy diffusion and retrenchment, but these follow a traditional German pattern: reforms within institutions rather than of institutions.",,,,,Retrenchment; Welfare state; Political economy; German; Economics; Unemployment; Path dependence; Context (language use); German model; Politics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/wzblpe/spi2005101.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:wzblpe:spi2005101,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/wzblpe/spi2005101.html,,,3124804131,,0,,7,false,,

Using spatial econometric models for limited dependent variables, this paper presents evidence on the diffusion of charter schools among California school districts. Strong positive spatial correlation either in the districts' predisposition towards the establishment of charter schools or between the districts' predisposition and lagged adoptions of neighbors is found. The results support the view that in decentralized systems of government the diffusion of new political technologies is driven by horizontal interactions among jurisdictions.",,,,,Diffusion (business); Regional science; Government; Emulation; Economics; Econometric model; Variables; State (polity); Charter; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1123405,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1123405,,,3123647266,,0,,3,false,,

This paper presents evidence on the extent of international convergence inpublic policy, with particular focus on labour, welfare, savings and retirement policy.

Recently, this debate has yielded an outcome in the form of the so-called Hartz laws, a bundle of labour market policies aimed at the reduction of unemployment and the decrease of non-wage labour costs. The Hartz reforms have played a prominent role in the public discussion, but are they really a watershed as both optimists and pessimists claim? In this article we investigate in what sense the Hartz reforms mark a substantive political change and how they are related to similar processes in other countries. To characterise the policy output we discuss three views of policy reform: reform as a process of policy-learning, reform as a process of competitive realignment and reform as a process of reinforcing path dependence. We show which of the three paradigms accounts for which part of the political result.

105-978-255-087-082,Mental health policy adoption as a seminal event: A response to recent commentaries.,2015-04-24,2015,journal article,International journal of health policy and management,23225939,Kerman University of Medical Science,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",Gordon C Shen,"The leadership for mental health is not commensurate with the burden of mental, neurological, and substance (MNS) use disorders nationally or internationally. This is a sentiment I share with Prof. Jenkins (1) and Ms. Lee (2). With that said, I would like to make two clarifications about my study and two concomitant acknowledgements about its limitations (3). First, I conceptualized national mental health policy adoption as an isolated event. Policy adoption is one – albeit pivotal – node embedded in a ratification process. Second, I focused solely on external actors’ influence on policy adoption. Politics and policy are intertwined, and there are certainly actors situated inside, as well as outside, each country who are engaged with mental health policy-making, but they were not addressed by my study. I will elaborate on what I set out to do before giving pointed responses to their comments. ; ; My global and historical account of the presence of mental health on national policy-making agendas is the result of harmonizing theory, quantitative methods, and different empirical contexts. The theoretical position I assumed was derived from the world polity theory (4). The world polity provides a set of cultural norms and guidance for each member country in dealing with the MNS burden prevalent in their population. The prediction is that mental health policy adoption, a trigger to mental health reform, would happen successively across countries due to their individual relationships with the World Health Organization (WHO) (“coercive isomorphism”), with their region and with one another (“mimetic isomorphism”). I chose discrete event history analysis to examine policy diffusion across countries in the WHO Mental Health Atlas and other secondary datasets. And I found trace evidence in support of these mechanisms that cut across geopolitical contexts and bind countries together. ; ; Prof. Jenkins and Ms. Lee have pointed out some of the limitations of my study, and offered interesting points of departure for me and other researchers. Studies designed using quantitative and/or qualitative methods can reveal different facets of mental health reform, which I concur with both Prof. Jenkins and Ms. Lee, and I used the former. For instance, “normative isomorphism”, a third potential mechanism of convergence in mental health policy adoption, was not accounted for in my study. Professional, research, civil society networks that span multiple countries can and do proffer tacit, scholarly, and practitioner knowledge to influence policy (5,6). The role these intermediaries play in national policy fora and their power relations are largely absent from multi-national databases, including the WHO Mental Health Atlas. The WHO and the Gulbenkian Global Mental Health Platform did jointly field a survey to the epistemic community involved with deinstitutionalization (7). Two of the five key principles respondents identified for deinstitutionalization is that political support at the highest and broadest level is crucial, and that policy change happens during certain windows of opportunity. Stakeholder and network analyses are just as important as quantitative analyses in shedding light on whether and how the target that the WHO stipulated for 80% of its member countries to develop or update their mental health policy in line with international and regional human rights instruments can be achieved by 2020 (8). The results of my study can only speak to the rate at which policy development occurred leading up to 2011. An update of my study using data from the 2014 WHO Mental Health Atlas, currently underway, could show whether adoption rates continued at the same rate beyond 2011. Finally, my study is an assessment done on the country level of analysis, but future studies would be well-served by tailoring my approach to elucidate the science behind the formulation and reformulation of evidence-based mental health policy sub-nationally. ; ; Mental health policies, unlike plans or legislations, are broad statements declaring decision-makers’ commitment to address the burden of MNS disorders prevalent among their citizens. Policy commitments would need to be coupled with and be reinforced by funding flows and governance structures to be fulfilled. In answering to Lee about the need to examine policy effectiveness in addition to policy adoption, Prof. Snowden and I would refer readers to another published study where I compared changes different policy adoption groups made in population-scaled psychiatric bed rates over the course of a decade (9). We found that countries that are late-adopters of mental health policy are more likely to reduce psychiatric beds in mental hospitals and other biomedical settings than innovators, whereas they are less likely to reduce psychiatric beds in general hospitals than non-adopters. We thus inferred that late adopters are motivated to implement deinstitutionalization for technical efficiency reasons rather than social legitimacy reasons. The two quantitative studies are related in their theoretical rationale and empirical contexts examined. Policy commitments have a lagged impact on the process indicators Prof. Snowden and I scrutinized. Policy’s impact on outcome indicators such as morbidity and mortality take even longer to be realized. ; ; Sea changes in global agreements after my study period are causes of optimism, but it remains to be seen whether the same changes will to be reflected on the national level. Most notably, the WHO’s Mental Health Action Plan (2013-20) was adopted by 194 member states during the 66th World Health Assembly. Mental health also has political support from bilateral funding agencies such as Grand Challenges Canada. However, reporting against set targets remains nascent given how recent these international commitments were made to mental health. To elaborate on the point made by Prof. Jenkins, mental healthcare and substance abuse control are both subsumed under the code 12191 for “Medical services” in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Creditor Reporting System. Systematic, cross-national collection of data, including aid data would ultimately improve the way mental health is treated as a policy issue. ; ; National mental health policy adoption is a seminal, focusing event which changes the status quo of treatment and prevention for MNS disorders. Ideally, it sets into motion the reform of mental health system in an iterative and recursive manner. IJHPM readers would hopefully find the vectors coming out of the exchange between me, Prof. Jenkins, and Ms. Lee inspiring for their future research.",4,7,493,494,Mental health; Sociology; Mimetic isomorphism; Epistemic community; Global mental health; Normative isomorphism; Coercive isomorphism; National Policy; Population; Public administration; Public relations,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26188817/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4493593 https://ijhpm.com/pdf_3017_9c020757543a7b7b56d07bd0252dd0eb.html https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26188817 https://core.ac.uk/display/33487829 https://www.ijhpm.com/article_3017.html https://core.ac.uk/download/33487829.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.15171/ijhpm.2015.90,26188817,10.15171/ijhpm.2015.90,2125600839,PMC4493593,0,011-519-972-554-033; 027-330-095-013-340; 048-084-385-775-90X; 066-372-955-149-740; 071-846-033-952-37X; 107-223-490-512-824,0,true,cc-by,gold
106-308-658-566-719,"Legislation, Policy and Procedure: A Critical Study of The Child Protection Law in Kuwait",,2016,,,,,,Anne Al-Hosainy,"The aim of this study is to critically explore the effects of pre-existing norms on the establishment of child protection policies in Kuwait, as well as to deliver an analysis of the timeline of the formation of the Child Rights Law (CRL), taking into account the role of institutional and administrative capacities in the country. The subject is analyzed using the concepts of policy diffusion theory as well as family structure theory. Child abuse occurs in all societies in both developed and developing nations. Although the inevitability of child protection is commonly acknowledged, the pathways to recognize the problem vary from one country to the other. This study is based on a research review that highlights aspects of childhood, family, and violence in Kuwait. A parliament debate about child abuse and the lack of national regulations led to the suggestion for a child law establishment in 2013. Finally in March 2015 the CRL was approved, and it was passed in January 2016. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how the law was established and what will lead to its implementation. Investigation of documents has been embraced to comprehend the problem. Various countries have different understandings of child abuse; therefore nations react differently to this subject. Even though Kuwait is ranked in the top 10 richest countries according to its GDP per capita, there are multiple other factors that play a meaningful role is the way child abuse is looked upon, such as: the welfare system, socioeconomic situations, culture, and religion.

107-020-946-716-375,Policy Diffusion: An Agent-Based Approach,,2011,,,,,,S. Luyet,"Methods like Event History Analysis can show the existence of diffusion and part of its nature, but do not study the process itself. Nowadays, thanks to the increasing performance of computers, processes can be studied using computational modeling. This thesis presents an agent-based model of policy diffusion mainly inspired from the model developed by Braun and Gilardi (2006). I first start by developing a theoretical framework of policy diffusion that presents the main internal drivers of policy diffusion - such as the preference for the policy, the effectiveness of the policy, the institutional constraints, and the ideology - and its main mechanisms, namely learning, competition, emulation, and coercion. Therefore diffusion, expressed by these interdependencies, is a complex process that needs to be studied with computational agent-based modeling. In a second step, computational agent-based modeling is defined along with its most significant concepts: complexity and emergence. Using computational agent-based modeling implies the development of an algorithm and its programming. When this latter has been developed, we let the different agents interact. Consequently, a phenomenon of diffusion, derived from learning, emerges, meaning that the choice made by an agent is conditional to that made by its neighbors. As a result, learning follows an inverted S-curve, which leads to partial convergence - global divergence and local convergence - that triggers the emergence of political clusters; i.e. the creation of regions with the same policy. Furthermore, the average effectiveness in this computational world tends to follow a J-shaped curve, meaning that not only time is needed for a policy to deploy its effects, but that it also takes time for a country to find the best-suited policy. To conclude, diffusion is an emergent phenomenon from complex interactions and its outcomes as ensued from my model are in line with the theoretical expectations and the empirical evidence.Les methodes d'analyse de biographie (event history analysis) permettent de mettre en evidence l'existence de phenomenes de diffusion et de les decrire, mais ne permettent pas d'en etudier le processus. Les simulations informatiques, grâce aux performances croissantes des ordinateurs, rendent possible l'etude des processus en tant que tels. Cette these, basee sur le modele theorique developpe par Braun et Gilardi (2006), presente une simulation centree sur les agents des phenomenes de diffusion des politiques. Le point de depart de ce travail met en lumiere, au niveau theorique, les principaux facteurs de changement internes a un pays : la preference pour une politique donnee, l'efficacite de cette derniere, les contraintes institutionnelles, l'ideologie, et les principaux mecanismes de diffusion que sont l'apprentissage, la competition, l'emulation et la coercition. La diffusion, definie par l'interdependance des differents acteurs, est un systeme complexe dont l'etude est rendue possible par les simulations centrees sur les agents. Au niveau methodologique, nous presenterons egalement les principaux concepts sous-jacents aux simulations, notamment la complexite et l'emergence. De plus, l'utilisation de simulations informatiques implique le developpement d'un algorithme et sa programmation. Cette derniere realisee, les agents peuvent interagir, avec comme resultat l'emergence d'un phenomene de diffusion, derive de l'apprentissage, ou le choix d'un agent depend en grande partie de ceux faits par ses voisins. De plus, ce phenomene suit une courbe en S caracteristique, poussant a la creation de regions politiquement identiques, mais divergentes au niveau globale. Enfin, l'efficacite moyenne, dans ce monde simule, suit une courbe en J, ce qui signifie qu'il faut du temps, non seulement pour que la politique montre ses effets, mais egalement pour qu'un pays introduise la politique la plus efficace. En conclusion, la diffusion est un phenomene emergent resultant d'interactions complexes dont les resultats du processus tel que developpe dans ce modele correspondent tant aux attentes theoriques qu'aux resultats pratiques.",,,,,Diffusion (business); Humanities; Political science; Emergent phenomenon,,,,,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_2C7230CA9240.P001/REF.pdf https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_2C7230CA9240,https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_2C7230CA9240,,,2799814271,,0,,0,false,,

National Policy, Local Dynamics, and the Consequences for School Food in the U.S.",,2017,,,,,,Helena Carrillo Lyson,"Author(s): Lyson, Helena Carrillo | Advisor(s): Enriquez, Laura | Abstract: AbstractFood Fight! National Policy, Local Dynamics, and the Consequences for School Food in the U.S.by Helena Carrillo LysonDoctor of Philosophy in SociologyUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Laura Enriquez, ChairSkyrocketing childhood obesity rates in the U.S. have helped fuel mounting public concern about the health and well-being of America’s children. Efforts to address childhood obesity have increasingly targeted improvements to federal school food programs. Such programs provide critical nutrition to hundreds of thousands of children, including many low-income, minority youth who have been disproportionately affected by obesity. In particular, the landmark 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) marked the first substantial changes to federal school food policy in recent years, including stricter nutritional requirements for all foods served in schools. In addition, a growing, grassroots farm to school (FTS) movement, which seeks to improve student access to and consumption of fresh, healthy foods, has taken hold in cafeterias throughout the country. It is against this backdrop of dramatic changes to federal policy and widespread school food reform efforts that this dissertation explores how both top-down federal policies and bottom-up, local dynamics have affected the nature and quality of school food programs at both national and local levels. More specifically, this mixed methods project 1) quantitatively examines the effects of federal legislation and state-level sociopolitical factors on school food environments across the country as measured by the prevalence of FTS programs; and 2) qualitatively explores how local-level school food program implementation dynamics affect the outcomes of these programs in two case study school districts in California. Based on a variety of data sources, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s inaugural Farm to School Census, the quantitative analysis tests key hypotheses from the policy diffusion literature related to the impact of federal policy and state-level sociopolitical arrangements on the prevalence of FTS programs across the states. My results highlight inequities in state-level implementation of school food programs based on economic affluence, underscoring the need for increased federal funding to poorer states in order to subsidize the cost of FTS programming. The qualitative component of the project draws on 15 months of interview-based and participatory fieldwork in two large urban school districts resulting in a deep understanding of the nuances of local school food program dynamics and outcomes. Building on theories of neoliberalism and privatization from political and economic sociology, and extending sociological theories of social movement activism, I find that opposing operational structures of federal school food programs – privatized vs. self-operation – play a key role in setting local-level priorities for the meal programs on the ground. In particular, privatization effectively discourages schools from exploring the sourcing of fresh foods from small, local farmers and constrains grassroots FTS efforts. Self-operation, on the other hand, in conjunction with parent-activists, a motivated nutrition services director, and community support lends itself toward responsiveness to bottom-up social change efforts that can make school food reform a reality. By combining quantitative analysis of school food programs on a national scale with qualitative analysis of programs in case study school districts, my research sheds important light on the myriad factors that determine the nature and quality of federal nutrition programs on the ground, and what changes are needed to create healthier and more equitable school food environments throughout the country. In doing so, my findings contribute to critical policy discussions surrounding federal school food programs and childhood health.",,,,,Agriculture; Neoliberalism; Political science; Social change; Legislation; Farm to School; Food policy; Grassroots; National Policy; Economic growth,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9318f5v9 https://escholarship.org/content/qt9318f5v9/qt9318f5v9.pdf?t=p2qx87,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9318f5v9,,,2800307193,,0,000-594-854-431-025; 003-592-471-884-916; 004-606-080-097-297; 006-880-103-099-91X; 006-900-426-719-728; 008-682-576-216-886; 010-280-842-182-720; 010-288-449-017-119; 013-523-597-775-663; 015-072-308-549-495; 017-502-645-404-860; 018-453-816-651-363; 018-507-965-164-922; 025-769-089-706-640; 029-192-477-977-065; 031-615-138-009-645; 042-811-295-107-553; 050-016-123-635-111; 052-269-461-985-681; 055-498-815-134-39X; 055-803-055-466-751; 059-112-399-704-285; 061-771-138-593-303; 064-254-119-289-043; 064-440-192-325-329; 070-939-496-757-77X; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-271-476-154-952; 077-982-724-482-615; 081-566-709-917-475; 084-196-894-545-83X; 088-907-915-777-482; 091-266-569-353-716; 099-894-293-630-329; 100-385-481-402-639; 109-723-950-284-919; 131-502-649-538-682; 133-349-509-609-463; 141-984-836-446-772; 166-908-479-268-105; 175-658-759-454-460; 176-032-114-011-20X; 177-728-276-658-235; 183-237-914-278-888; 185-232-196-419-569; 188-203-909-664-377,0,false,,

107-462-254-364-186,Democratization and police reform,,2007,,,,,,Christopher Paun,"This paper compares police reforms during democratization in Poland, Hungary, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It analyses the changes to the structure of the democratic control of the police in each reform, paying special attention to the decentralization versus centralization aspect of it. The research question of this paper is: Why are some states decentralizing the democratic control of the police, while others are centralizing it, both with the aim of democratization? The theoretical background of this study are theories about policy diffusion and policy transfer. Therefore this study can be categorized as part of two different research areas. On the one hand, it is a paper from the discipline of International Relations. On the other hand, it is a paper from the discipline of Comparative Politics. The combined attention to international and national factors influencing police reform is reflected by the structure of this paper. Chapter 3 examines police structures and police reforms in established democracies as possible role models for new democracies. Chapter 4 looks at international and transnational actors that actively try to influence police reform. After having examined these external factors, three cases of police reform in new democracies are examined in chapter 5.",,,,,Decentralization; Political economy; Democratization; Political science; Control (management); Policy transfer; Research question; International relations; Democracy; Comparative politics,,,,,https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/docId/1789 https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/files/1789/paun_master.pdf,https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/docId/1789,,,3155584197,,0,002-830-834-944-549; 004-943-920-113-980; 006-005-932-680-757; 006-626-812-070-286; 010-997-433-633-568; 012-286-853-432-764; 012-962-348-869-747; 017-142-824-429-75X; 018-457-907-210-131; 021-160-963-136-280; 024-038-577-214-359; 026-723-940-576-417; 027-178-633-781-176; 027-931-625-349-524; 029-951-678-548-878; 030-769-074-318-400; 031-113-400-519-73X; 032-235-898-751-342; 032-439-740-181-25X; 036-880-554-527-379; 036-989-087-222-363; 037-078-477-329-798; 037-217-184-109-65X; 037-399-421-533-818; 038-423-169-720-446; 039-414-426-703-818; 039-781-464-347-169; 042-078-026-008-435; 043-916-462-789-836; 046-866-014-593-668; 047-985-051-960-648; 048-617-122-270-992; 048-767-461-145-727; 051-194-316-889-001; 052-870-937-566-245; 055-078-193-772-731; 056-055-269-198-882; 063-367-164-767-037; 063-810-724-868-703; 066-349-742-687-013; 071-114-292-220-356; 073-737-023-305-427; 074-429-879-257-815; 075-546-198-311-440; 077-687-891-501-228; 085-732-265-028-699; 086-685-491-611-206; 086-992-707-633-149; 087-101-035-881-899; 088-914-832-533-963; 090-339-997-423-731; 091-435-762-865-806; 092-156-897-674-067; 092-468-154-763-205; 094-477-496-920-992; 101-718-432-744-391; 103-577-677-633-960; 114-303-724-379-098; 119-019-958-995-524; 119-505-240-802-74X; 119-795-920-034-340; 122-589-834-107-76X; 124-222-510-570-346; 126-916-833-440-473; 140-635-139-528-64X; 142-195-477-792-722; 142-228-145-147-442; 143-003-211-737-07X; 146-920-596-496-998; 151-967-499-821-313; 169-314-932-859-423,1,false,,

Policy-making,,2017,book,Politics Trove,,Oxford University Press,,Christoph Knill; Jale Tosun,"<p>This chapter examines the process related to policy-making as well as potential determinants of policy choices. It begins with a discussion of conceptual models of policy-making, namely: the institutional, rational, incremental, group, elite, and process models. It then considers the policy cycle, which models the policy process as a series of political activities, consisting of agenda setting, policy formulation, policy adoption, implementation, and evaluation. It also analyses the role of institutions, frames, and policy styles in policy-making and concludes with an assessment of the most crucial domestic and international factors shaping the design of policies, focusing in particular on theories of policy diffusion, policy transfer, and cross-national policy convergence, along with international sources that affect domestic policy-making.</p>",,,,,Policy transfer; Elite; Policy studies; Policy making; Policy analysis; Process (computing); Political science; Public economics; Convergence (economics); Politics; Public administration; Economics; Public policy; Computer science; Economic growth; Law; Operating system,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/hepl/9780198737421.003.0022,,10.1093/hepl/9780198737421.003.0022,,,0,,1,false,,

A multi-dimensional analysis was used to discover how newspapers reported changes in Queensland’s public sector information (PSI) policy to identify whether stories on PSI policy were reframed over time. At a quantitative level, the text analytics software Leximancer was used to identify key concepts, issues and trends in 786 relevant articles from national, metropolitan and regional newspapers. At a qualitative level, discourse analysis was used to identify key themes and patterns from the newspaper articles. Both qualitative and quantitative shifts in the media reporting of Right to Information (RTI) and FOI were revealed across three time periods representing the periods before, during and after the reform implementation. The findings offer insights into the role of newspapers in policy diffusion, revealing how Queensland media reports framed the shift in PSI policy from pull model FOI to push model RTI.",162,1,90,106,Journalism; Public sector; Metropolitan area; Economics; Framing (social sciences); Newspaper; Freedom of information; Policy transfer; Public administration; Public relations; Discourse analysis,,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1329878X16680655 https://ecommons.aku.edu/eastafrica_gsmc/16/ http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1329878X16680655 https://ecommons.aku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=eastafrica_gsmc http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1329878X16680655?journalCode=miad https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:472466 https://core.ac.uk/download/84855109.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1329878x16680655,,10.1177/1329878x16680655,2580994287,,0,001-481-906-279-295; 004-596-329-016-223; 009-449-071-775-901; 009-878-671-268-511; 025-109-323-703-170; 043-200-840-148-259; 060-203-651-895-925; 062-708-339-721-716; 073-764-872-184-379; 108-968-598-839-020; 122-951-398-160-669; 130-406-213-454-895; 136-937-750-820-695; 141-409-033-271-664; 193-502-618-625-23X,0,true,cc0,green

Three graduate student coders familiar with the policy typologies literature were independently asked to identify three types of policies: (a) morality policies – a form of social regulatory policy in which the government practices “the exercise of legal authority to affirm, modify, or replace community values, moral practices, and norms of interpersonal conflict” (Tatalovich and Daynes 1998, xxx); (b) governance policies – a category of regulatory policy that “modifies the behavior of the public sector and government officials” by changing the rules of the political system to “regulate how the state should proceed to govern” (Tolbert 2002, 80); and (c) state regulatory policies , – economic, environmental, and professional regulatory policy innovations in which government uses its coercive authority to shape the behavior of private industry or citizens in order to achieve policy goals. Coders were given a fourth option for policies that did not match any of these criteria. Because policies are often overlapping (involving both regulatory and morality components), coders were instructed to classify policies by their dominant characteristics. Only policies with perfect intercoder agreement were included in the aggregated measure. This method identified 40 regulatory policies, 22 morality policies, and 10 governance policies. These policies are listed in pages that follow.",,,197,200,Public economics; Private sector; Public sector; Government; Political science; Order (exchange); Morality; State (polity); Political system; Public administration; Corporate governance,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/policy-diffusion-dynamics-in-america/innovations-collected-by-policy-type-and-target/8735E148DA8DFA4193FA74985CF3BC48,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511778834.009,,10.1017/cbo9780511778834.009,1015240441,,0,,0,false,,
110-469-019-707-134,Divergence and Convergence in the Diffusion of Performance Management in China,2016-03-23,2016,journal article,Public Performance & Management Review,15309576; 15579271,Informa UK Limited,United Kingdom,Wei Liu; Wenzhao Li,"ABSTRACTThis research focuses on policy diffusion of performance management in authoritarian China. A three-stage theory of diffusion is proposed by conducting a process that traces divergence and convergence in the diffusion of performance management in China. When a superior government only has a policy goal, the inferior governments, competing for innovation, will develop divergent policy instruments. When the superior government’s policy goal and policy content seem clear, local governments, competing for loyalty or bandwagoning, adjust their diverged policy instruments to converged ones conforming to the superior’s policy content. Finally, when the superior government issues a systematic set of policy goals, content, and instruments, it may use coercive power to promote diffusion. In the process, when the contents of diffusion are different, the superior government applies different levels of coercive power, and the mechanisms, characteristics, and outcomes of diffusion also differ.

110-756-608-594-491,"Accommodating Housing in India: Lessons from Development Capital, Policy Frames, and Slums",2016-09-14,2016,,,,,,Cheryl K. Young,"Author(s): Young, Cheryl | Advisor(s): Reid, Carolina | Abstract: Since the nation’s first Five-Year Plan in 1951, the Government of India has focused attention on increasing the country’s housing supply, particularly for low-income households. The nature of housing policy has shifted over the years, however, with the most recent period focused on developing a private housing market through governmental support of mortgage finance institutions and the establishment of a housing finance regulator. Despite these efforts, recent estimates place India’s housing deficit at close to 19 million units with tens of millions of the nation’s population living in slums. There has been limited research that has traced the evolution of India’s housing policy since 1951, precluding our ability to understand the persistence of unmet housing demand and the proliferation of slums.This dissertation fills this gap by examining how low-income housing policy is shaped in India at three scales: 1) the global, 2) the national, and 3) the local or household scale. It argues that this multi-scalar approach to examining housing policy is necessary in order understand the factors that shape specific policy regimes. In India, international flows of capital collide with nationalistic goals of “slum-free” cities to produce specific policy actions, which again are shaped by the particulars of households’ decisions about where they choose to live and why. The dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter 1 introduces the low-income housing challenge in India, describes the three housing policy paradigms that dominate global housing policy discourse and praxis, and provides a review of how housing is funded in India. Chapter 2 approaches low-income housing policy at the global scale, applying theories of policy diffusion to make the case that low-income housing policy in India is shaped by funding flows and knowledge-sharing from international actors. This chapter traces shelter lending from the World Bank Group, the single largest outside provider of development capital for housing to India, and examines the degree and type of influence the Bank has had on India’s approach to low-income housing. This analysis reveals that India is most susceptible to policy shifts that reflect the World Bank’s own policy objectives when it is most in need of outside funding. When India’s financial position is strong, housing projects are seen as attractive investments by the World Bank Group’s private sector arm and serve to provide momentum for India’s own housing policy objectives. Chapter 3 is situated at the national scale and examines the role of policy frames in India’s public discourse on low-income housing in shaping the specific policies of different planning eras. The analysis applies a mixed-methods approach to reading the housing-related chapters in each of India’s twelve Five-Year Plans. These documents provide an ongoing, textual record of national directives and external messages concerning the country’s central planning efforts. Subjecting the plans to qualitative content and computational text analyses reveals the contours of India’s housing policy frames. This chapter finds that larger shifts in policy frames occur after significant events that fundamentally alter the Government of India’s conception of its institutional and fiduciary role in low-income housing provision.Chapter 4 concentrates on the local scale, examining housing demand across two major Indian cities. The myriad low-income housing policies implemented by the Government of India have systematically overlooked low-income households’ demand or willingness to pay for housing. This chapter questions whether low-income housing policies have been remiss in ignoring their beneficiaries' preferences for housing characteristics. The data used here are previously-collected household surveys in the Maharashtrian cities of Mumbai and Pune. Using a hedonic analysis of housing markets, this chapter compares income and price elasticities of demand between slum and non-slum households. The findings reveal that demand elasticities are higher among slum-households, but also expose a number of empirical issues that compromise external validity when using pre-existing household survey data. The findings from this dissertation have implications for India as it continues to urbanize and craft housing policies to address imminent growth. Other developing and emerging economies can also benefit from this scaled analysis that utilizes a range of data sources and methods to critically examine the role external forces play in shaping national housing policy, how the national government frames its approach to low-income housing, and what household behavior can reveal about which policies to pursue.",,,,,Emerging markets; Private sector; Government; Economics; Planned economy; Position (finance); Slum; Population; Development economics; Economic growth; Scale (social sciences),,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4pw782h9 https://escholarship.org/content/qt4pw782h9/qt4pw782h9.pdf?t=odhue1 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4pw782h9.pdf,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4pw782h9,,,2545516640,,0,000-236-878-104-360; 001-062-845-680-387; 001-091-124-402-371; 002-285-946-205-061; 002-515-408-083-416; 002-595-147-873-972; 002-624-554-906-583; 003-376-095-373-816; 003-441-391-245-622; 003-544-056-320-324; 004-285-761-649-582; 005-062-076-268-704; 007-160-508-017-573; 007-726-932-343-028; 008-764-292-394-831; 008-914-217-222-934; 009-285-222-350-903; 010-865-914-495-157; 011-088-314-276-746; 011-218-686-196-352; 012-909-266-553-092; 013-031-948-957-725; 013-118-820-698-404; 013-119-111-595-159; 014-224-700-732-060; 014-747-951-289-457; 015-454-769-968-071; 016-328-230-939-161; 017-567-575-470-287; 018-212-668-836-616; 020-596-218-483-734; 020-900-835-306-040; 021-833-963-482-814; 022-227-655-463-781; 022-281-581-052-513; 023-527-288-646-316; 024-453-119-560-674; 025-016-303-542-821; 026-412-549-797-331; 026-644-400-296-128; 028-032-452-025-763; 028-863-455-772-286; 029-985-760-740-784; 030-804-578-832-201; 031-074-959-120-51X; 033-034-863-713-86X; 033-478-711-942-185; 034-204-036-062-309; 034-616-208-582-53X; 037-305-444-508-834; 037-413-356-548-332; 038-735-689-164-853; 039-493-024-642-424; 039-493-962-854-52X; 040-406-529-735-236; 040-747-723-579-13X; 041-240-642-190-580; 041-345-179-687-990; 045-636-896-316-098; 046-287-152-919-56X; 046-444-271-300-109; 048-041-062-404-055; 048-311-488-199-13X; 048-572-765-486-125; 049-888-347-057-691; 050-274-654-059-514; 050-718-944-413-694; 051-356-987-199-094; 052-349-995-550-914; 053-255-084-841-04X; 053-865-640-931-571; 056-449-585-767-620; 057-593-263-050-187; 058-042-417-218-030; 059-665-982-507-836; 061-484-818-034-175; 062-633-260-460-505; 062-976-613-317-603; 063-412-364-302-98X; 064-293-473-562-913; 064-882-116-569-370; 064-909-919-692-45X; 065-107-741-804-152; 065-450-718-289-488; 066-141-735-734-026; 067-012-899-033-272; 068-500-534-501-095; 069-555-860-560-132; 069-959-548-941-695; 069-993-649-820-568; 070-234-188-060-620; 070-983-442-226-533; 072-050-889-156-71X; 072-840-218-973-627; 072-855-211-434-817; 074-600-887-219-779; 077-945-151-328-246; 078-488-778-759-301; 080-971-185-294-117; 084-196-473-699-689; 084-447-883-341-608; 086-163-694-850-604; 087-986-669-555-148; 088-943-926-981-532; 089-268-279-118-029; 089-950-841-979-187; 090-491-533-429-584; 092-236-495-760-421; 093-016-532-112-637; 095-656-007-684-66X; 098-493-032-656-746; 098-658-224-449-285; 098-718-348-241-488; 099-336-614-468-857; 099-366-378-708-093; 100-460-762-930-005; 101-488-954-100-242; 104-196-054-107-208; 111-312-648-755-025; 112-161-780-094-704; 112-545-601-494-925; 113-095-451-560-632; 114-301-579-506-492; 122-557-640-774-082; 123-523-669-210-978; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-361-658-002-698; 129-579-205-304-352; 129-967-868-059-356; 130-969-298-223-787; 137-763-843-323-494; 139-004-669-583-252; 142-244-582-708-148; 143-467-103-336-901; 146-931-252-143-447; 147-181-825-363-815; 147-490-086-133-184; 147-553-152-586-321; 158-240-162-830-879; 166-662-528-759-027; 166-712-224-761-948; 167-326-016-263-726; 168-129-822-256-006; 168-389-041-360-514; 168-488-466-492-663; 168-627-086-668-409; 174-877-736-436-319; 181-059-203-842-188; 197-372-369-313-288; 197-541-268-876-350; 199-254-944-645-20X,0,false,,

Tempus is the oldest and most dominant instrument to modernize higher education in central and east European countries. It promotes the adoption of key managerial reforms elements. Drawing of these perspectives on policy diffusion, we analyze the relative impact of the program. Based on data from over 50 Western Balkan universities, we compare institutions deeply involved in the Tempus program and those minimally involved or non-affiliated with Tempus.

The diffusion of laws and regulations across political boundaries can reduce the tension that arises between innovation and consistency. Policy diffusion has been a topic of focus across the social sciences for several decades, but due to limitations of data and computational capacity, researchers have not taken a comprehensive and data-intensive look at the aggregate, cross-policy patterns of diffusion.

Even if the ultimate outcome of this influence only in few cases leads to unconditional convergence, the EU has markedly accelerated policy diffusion among its member states.",,,,,Public economics; Outcome (game theory); Economics; International economics; European integration; Tax policy; Harmonization; Competition (economics); Convergence (relationship); Double taxation; Unconditional convergence,,,,,http://aei.pitt.edu/59170/,http://aei.pitt.edu/59170/,,,884946109,,0,,1,false,,

Martin,"<jats:p>This paper presents inquiries into the interdependence of cigarette taxation in U.S. states between 1971 and 2006. It is argued that diffusion influences emanating from the tax policies of other states have an effect that is conditional upon the government ideology in a focal state. Specifically, it is shown that only those state governments that are not positioned on the far right end of an ideology continuum use an environment of high cigarette taxes to pursue their fiscal and health policy goals. At the same time, interventionist ideology can only be effective if it operates within a favorable policy environment. I argue that casting policy diffusion as conditional allows for empirically more accurate and theoretically richer models.</jats:p>",6,1,,,Diffusion (business); Political economy; Ideology; Political science; Tax competition; Economic system; Politics,,,,,https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/wps.2010.6.1/wps.2010.6.1.1087/wps.2010.6.1.1087.xml?lang=en https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/wps.2010.6.1/wps.2010.6.1.1087/wps.2010.6.1.1087.xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1935-6226.1087,,10.2202/1935-6226.1087,2327551982,,0,,7,false,,

International organizations’ mandates influence government behavior. Dependency on external resources, namely foreign aid, also affects governments’ formulation of national policy. And finally, mounting adoption in a region alters the risk, benefits, and information associated with a given policy. Methods I use post-war, discrete time data spanning 1950 to 2011 and describing 193 nations’ mental health systems to test these diffusion mechanisms. Results I find that the adoption of mental health policy is highly clustered temporally and spatially. Results provide support that membership in the World Health Organization (WHO), interdependence with neighbors and peers in regional blocs, national income status, and migrant sub-population are responsible for isomorphism. Aid, however, is an insufficient determinant of mental health policy adoption. Conclusion This study examines the extent to which mental, neurological, and substance use disorder are addressed in national and international contexts through the lens of policy diffusion theory. It also adds to policy dialogues about non-communicable diseases as nascent items on the global health agenda.",,,,,Public economics; Mental health; Government; Political science; New institutionalism; Polity; National Policy; Global health; Measures of national income and output; Isomorphism (sociology),,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2511722,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2511722,,,3122689427,,0,014-128-081-516-800; 077-755-989-237-949; 113-377-188-742-45X; 122-704-086-357-851; 145-647-086-916-672; 163-145-773-402-959; 175-419-683-343-300,3,false,,

This question is important insofar as it looks at the rise of ""policy diffusion"" in the former country of Czechoslovakia. In 2004, Slovakia - following the course taken by the Baltic states and Russia - approved a flat 19% rate on incomes. However, its neighbor the Czech Republic maintained progressive taxation until 2008, when they also joined the flat tax club. This paper analyzes the extent to which Slovakia was influenced by prior flat tax adopters, and then turns attention to the Czech Republic's decision to join the flat tax club after years of resistance. I argue that the timing influences the process by which policies change. The longer a policy is known to the public the greater the challenge of adopting it. Moreover, right-wing politicians in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic become prominent carriers of the flat tax idea, even in the face of mounting criticism.",,,,,Value-added tax; Economy; Dividend tax; Geography; Club; Flat tax; Czech; Market economy; Tax reform; Criticism,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1452127 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1464950_code629430.pdf?abstractid=1452127&mirid=1,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1452127,,,2295058062,,0,,0,false,,

E. de Vries-Jordan,"<p>Marriage equality movements have been successful in achieving policy change in an increasing number of states. Hence, a growing body of scholarship has explored institutional and cultural factors that influence activists’ tactics and messaging and, in turn, contribute to marriage equality policy diffusion. Democracies with parliamentary, presidential, and semi-presidential systems, federal and unitary states with varying levels of centralization, and the presence or absence of constitutional anti-discrimination protections provide social movements with divergent political opportunity structures, contributing to dynamics in their tactical choices. In addition, the type of electoral system and party system, the presence of political parties that are movement allies, the use of conscience votes, the level of party discipline, the presence of out LGBT elected officials and straight political allies, and the degree of political will to enact policy change also impact activists’ strategic calculations. Finally, the use of personalized narratives in advocates’ messaging, the framing of marriage equality and LGBT rights as human rights norms, the adoption of family values frames to coopt opponents’ messaging, and the use of homonationalist versus homophobic discourses to justify policymaking decisions regarding same-sex marriage are explored. This article provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research concerning all of the states that have legalized same-sex marriage as well as a detailed analysis of the mechanisms used to achieve policy change. After examining how different explanatory factors perform in accounting for the dynamics in marriage equality activism and policy convergence across a broad range of national contexts, new directions for future scholarship are suggested.</p>",,,,,Social movement; Diffusion (business); Economics; Marriage equality; Demographic economics,,,,,http://politics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1343 https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1343 https://politics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1343,,10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1343,2887980756,,0,,0,false,,

To accomplish such objectives, South Korea was selected as a case in point by which to test the proposed twenty theoretical hypotheses. The focus of this study is to ascertain the motivation, barriers and outcomes of knowledge transfer or policy diffusion from one country to another country. Contrary to some assumptions about incentives for conducting a knowledge transference project, this study reveals that the primary driving forces for implementing such programs are the national interests of the donor and recipient countries. There are, however, many barriers to knowledge transference programs. These barriers could be classified as at the national, organizational, and individual levels, or could be interpreted in terms of political, economic, social and cultural aspects. The overall conclusion for the outcome of the knowledge transference projects is that it is successful.

114-161-511-060-816,Trying to keep up with the Joneses: A study of peer diffusion by American public research universities,2007-06-26,2007,,,,,,Matthew Alexander Weinstein,"Political scientists examining the phenomenon of policy diffusion have routinely found that states within a similar geographical region tend to adopt similar policies over time. This result has been proven over a wide range of social policies and time periods. The theoretical logic behind the ""contiguous state"" explanation is twofold. First, states are in constant economic competition with each other for valuable resources such as industries and productive citizens, which in turn places pressure on state legislatures to emulate the public policies enacted by their adjacent neighbor so as not to lose the inter-state battle. Second, state governments and agencies lack the necessary resources (in terms of money, time, and information) to conduct a thorough investigation of potential policies to address their specific public issues. Thus they engage in a form of ""satisficing"" where instead of enacting the ideal policy solution, state policy-makers simply adopt familiar and convenient policies from their neighboring states. Unfortunately political scientists have only primarily applied this theory to the institution of state legislatures, raising the question about its generalizability to other public policy institutions. This dissertation tests this question by applying the theory to the institution of public research universities while concurrently exploring a novel alternative explanation for policy diffusion - peer pressure. Using an original data set of three highly salient higher education policies (establishing a technology transfer office, launching a capital campaign, and raising tuition) this dissertation finds that the actions of one's peers (universities that share similar levels of prestige) can have a greater influence than the actions of one's geographical neighbors in determining the eventual implementation of specific policies. This finding highlights the importance of professional reputation when creating policy networks that lead to institutional innovations.",,,,,Public policy; Higher education; Political science; Policy studies; Peer pressure; Institution; Public relations; Reputation; Legislature; Satisficing,,,,,http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/7287/1/MattAWeinstein5.11.07.pdf http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/7287/,http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/7287/,,,2137388430,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 002-135-097-462-376; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-620-624-540-400; 005-692-270-875-15X; 008-986-463-467-067; 009-357-166-288-358; 009-425-813-612-612; 010-345-377-307-579; 013-126-282-071-945; 015-591-021-271-179; 019-246-425-600-379; 019-456-406-334-322; 021-727-755-047-907; 027-827-119-143-849; 028-657-520-508-063; 029-794-495-749-291; 029-874-087-945-656; 032-164-929-841-901; 032-510-161-156-788; 036-159-702-886-637; 036-337-838-186-532; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-472-046-682-309; 039-269-092-789-181; 048-413-313-313-364; 050-082-471-457-812; 054-147-200-088-12X; 054-254-457-307-854; 057-621-004-140-001; 059-744-102-244-624; 059-985-565-107-13X; 062-554-485-459-673; 063-212-074-039-179; 064-729-721-799-018; 068-536-258-079-020; 068-905-690-168-04X; 073-753-993-648-180; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 084-787-681-556-687; 086-616-517-831-399; 090-394-845-362-302; 096-517-829-236-651; 096-924-558-296-975; 097-416-968-699-086; 100-780-263-273-98X; 101-127-387-013-017; 106-988-088-562-098; 114-156-288-181-896; 120-430-735-161-851; 122-753-496-105-56X; 129-090-487-615-699; 130-122-811-229-300; 139-133-079-965-85X; 148-460-439-813-652; 151-091-670-021-25X; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-637-734-144-951; 178-883-041-977-406; 179-021-942-561-069; 189-917-633-904-27X; 191-822-445-578-286; 193-040-292-664-023,4,false,,

Yet the recent ‘spatial turn’ in comparative politics has also influenced welfare state research. For some years now, the field has been witnessing a growing interest in questions about interdependencies and policy diffusion between countries. In this article, we provide a structured overview of the state of the art in the policy diffusion and transfer literature that deals specifically with social policy. We present and critically evaluate existing theoretical concepts and quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches that enable the analysis of interdependencies between countries. Moreover, we summarize the empirical findings of quantitative and qualitative studies on the diffusion and transfer of social policy, from some pioneering studies to the latest findings. Against this background we point out what we believe to be promising avenues for future research. We focus on five areas: theoretical work on the mechanisms underlying diffusion and transfer; methodological approaches; the impact of domestic institutions and policy characteristics on social policy diffusion and transfer; programme-specific dynamics; and the systematic combination of horizontal and vertical interdependencies.",47,1,111,129,Public economics; Policy analysis; Welfare state; Economics; Interdependence; Qualitative research; Social policy; Policy transfer; Horizontal and vertical; Comparative politics,,,,,http://findresearcher.sdu.dk/portal/da/publications/policy-diffusion-and-policy-transfer-in-comparative-welfare-state-research(17754e2d-fe7a-43df-b3dd-c4c7577c538d)/export.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/spol.12003 https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/publications/policy-diffusion-and-policy-transfer-in-comparative-welfare-state https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spol.12003/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/spol.12003,,10.1111/spol.12003,2020078061,,0,000-803-694-602-443; 003-193-896-799-954; 003-513-319-335-404; 004-375-451-605-479; 005-249-461-623-469; 010-118-914-495-318; 010-278-292-671-040; 010-760-865-068-229; 011-497-790-292-357; 012-328-640-760-580; 017-249-124-720-757; 018-507-965-164-922; 021-216-291-636-927; 024-004-469-792-295; 024-953-859-303-113; 025-112-618-417-304; 033-085-475-899-252; 033-398-973-405-70X; 035-870-065-215-256; 036-825-482-394-084; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-400-584-474-195; 039-547-330-572-082; 040-984-026-537-427; 042-583-625-945-348; 043-426-670-556-20X; 043-506-165-559-979; 043-857-339-378-727; 044-566-597-109-593; 044-958-408-877-837; 046-990-963-221-119; 047-262-775-098-337; 050-274-654-059-514; 052-513-369-850-209; 058-788-533-475-801; 061-373-791-267-531; 062-866-137-568-841; 065-666-299-776-558; 067-490-686-317-462; 067-556-730-308-483; 070-150-985-024-413; 070-491-706-755-13X; 071-598-729-761-942; 071-846-033-952-37X; 072-862-908-678-93X; 073-703-393-997-98X; 073-907-101-210-976; 074-465-905-471-400; 077-945-151-328-246; 082-017-566-839-450; 082-299-686-848-210; 083-128-427-871-272; 085-034-227-045-860; 086-139-872-882-01X; 086-825-113-425-889; 088-421-133-532-819; 089-956-227-750-507; 092-645-591-040-210; 104-368-865-652-566; 105-526-785-996-251; 108-260-688-587-740; 112-654-780-338-479; 112-962-096-683-174; 115-667-337-333-237; 116-125-662-494-181; 117-677-347-760-402; 120-610-824-268-907; 121-133-996-131-146; 125-268-617-755-543; 127-826-672-055-220; 128-150-266-973-359; 129-827-835-580-183; 133-819-007-054-078; 139-704-764-397-340; 145-428-474-771-751; 155-580-858-393-517; 157-969-366-462-465; 163-637-734-144-951; 182-659-171-513-325; 190-032-990-340-879,88,false,,
114-410-567-464-603,Trend‐setters in environmental policy: the character and role of pioneer countries,2005-03-17,2005,journal article,European Environment,09610405; 10990976,Wiley,United States,Martin Jänicke,"There is reason to believe that environmental policy convergence resulting from policy diffusion is influenced not only by functional imperatives of the world market, but also by a collective behaviour of national governments, where pioneer countries function as (intellectual) leaders under conditions of uncertainty. Their solutions for general environmental problems are adopted by other countries. As a rule, there is one single solution that is preferred by a large group or the majority of countries. This regulatory ‘conformism’ makes pioneer roles of countries highly relevant. The article analyses the character and role of such ‘trend-setters’ in environmental policy.; ;  A necessary condition for becoming a pioneer country in environmental policy is a high domestic capacity for environmental policy-making. This encompasses institutional, economic and informational framework conditions as well as the relative strength of the green advocacy coalition of a country. While these factors refer to relatively stable factors of policy-making, this does not explain why sometimes countries give up their roles as pioneers. To explain this, an analytical framework is proposed that encompasses situative factors, strategic factors and actor constellations, especially the coalition between organized proponents of environmental objectives and economic modernizers. This coalition of ecological modernizers may break down, for example in times of economic crisis. The political and economic framework conditions of globalization may sometimes bear impediments for pioneers, but at the same time they also provide incentives for highly advanced countries to take over national pioneer roles – at least in the field of environmental protection, which has become an important issue in the competition for innovation.

Steinwand,"Existing research has linked the adoption of pension reforms to demographic pressures, party ideology, and the diffusion of social policy ideas. We argue that pension policy change in Western Europe is also related to the “shock” of European Monetary Union (EMU). We use a Spatial Autoregressive Probit model with event-history features to test whether the decision to reform can be best explained by domestic factors, diffusion dynamics, or similar exposure to a common shock. We find that EMU made pension reform more likely for low and moderately indebted countries in the early 1990s but delayed reform in the late 1990s. Demographic pressures and policy diffusion also mattered for reform adoption, but not more than the EMU shock.",40,4,477,505,Ideology; Economics; International economics; Social policy; Pension; European union; Diffusion dynamics; Western europe; Shock (economics); Economic growth; Probit model,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/ginixx/v40y2014i4p477-505.html https://cogentoa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050629.2014.892874 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/21068/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050629.2014.892874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03050629.2014.892874,,10.1080/03050629.2014.892874,2082156921,,0,000-040-687-635-121; 002-494-549-964-989; 003-102-506-571-342; 004-103-733-854-845; 004-141-353-457-992; 004-423-021-772-916; 008-484-810-324-598; 011-497-790-292-357; 018-054-444-414-034; 021-216-291-636-927; 022-444-895-555-897; 022-835-656-502-913; 023-843-404-656-218; 027-419-212-877-975; 033-085-475-899-252; 033-368-725-029-832; 035-762-699-112-154; 038-818-459-512-182; 040-532-896-815-85X; 040-727-622-423-55X; 044-692-751-753-297; 047-541-831-866-620; 047-841-172-419-070; 050-082-471-457-812; 051-218-293-446-593; 057-471-732-054-127; 058-071-798-060-611; 064-542-733-606-527; 068-527-009-607-748; 070-439-295-045-214; 076-913-976-639-484; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 088-665-707-744-409; 088-970-978-435-553; 090-591-340-859-201; 093-190-746-631-057; 093-976-962-761-459; 095-421-061-786-644; 098-596-335-805-448; 106-939-895-456-290; 107-046-074-230-276; 108-266-278-988-936; 123-874-390-256-391; 123-934-251-435-535; 127-400-375-856-066; 131-900-393-723-959; 132-433-110-054-676; 154-314-204-508-516; 157-663-568-772-128; 163-076-040-775-567; 163-841-381-799-159; 167-009-354-081-504; 171-440-949-606-296; 172-362-636-200-979; 172-514-575-075-51X; 179-533-157-602-32X; 179-852-785-824-255,4,false,,

Previous literature has analysed the determinants of the introduction of lobbying laws in the US states. However, the last 15 years have witnessed a booming popularity of lobbying laws across the world. Building upon the existing literature, this study seeks to explain the introduction of lobbying laws in EU and OECD member states from 1995 to 2014. The analysis considers variables related to the presence of lobbying scandals, the external promotion by international organizations and corporatism. The causal mechanisms follow the theoretical arguments developed in the literature on political agenda-setting effects, policy diffusion and theories of interest representation. The empirical investigation is based on an original dataset and a statistical investigation using event history analysis and multinomial regression models. The results suggest that policy diffusion variables influence the likelihood of passing lobbying laws. While scandals only affect the presentation of proposals for lobbying regulation in Parliament, corporatism shows no effects on the passage of such laws.",6,3,231,252,Public policy; Political science; Law; Representation (politics); Corporatism; Popularity; Parliament; Promotion (rank); Political communication; Politics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41309-017-0025-x https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/why-do-we-have-rules-on-lobbying-investigating-the-introduction-o,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41309-017-0025-x,,10.1057/s41309-017-0025-x,2730407113,,0,000-622-154-986-332; 002-138-813-516-907; 003-025-422-339-881; 003-089-541-128-449; 005-799-873-507-92X; 006-410-443-696-546; 007-156-691-105-843; 012-467-150-825-142; 015-994-689-455-476; 016-839-509-752-008; 017-758-111-908-983; 019-586-692-700-500; 021-639-967-808-78X; 021-784-121-839-954; 022-612-797-933-321; 023-084-335-990-647; 023-104-859-734-471; 026-214-409-058-839; 028-256-744-113-514; 030-334-319-968-418; 030-926-622-415-081; 033-022-378-440-230; 034-428-774-169-063; 036-185-256-483-027; 040-890-082-669-89X; 041-285-864-921-843; 044-450-304-630-226; 044-534-733-416-007; 044-637-890-980-818; 047-812-993-541-791; 048-227-174-646-062; 050-484-823-624-111; 056-265-024-413-439; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-850-774-734-000; 063-449-082-764-122; 065-087-878-920-87X; 065-161-208-963-283; 075-993-442-049-689; 080-827-687-985-237; 083-316-412-230-008; 087-477-982-333-079; 087-535-931-939-575; 094-254-065-796-266; 096-972-010-542-903; 101-754-065-040-138; 103-974-930-027-446; 107-060-932-031-304; 107-549-577-422-549; 107-918-271-094-715; 108-672-101-561-981; 112-333-966-495-520; 116-672-218-645-089; 117-677-347-760-402; 123-302-046-945-936; 123-851-017-534-013; 126-757-491-197-825; 127-100-671-121-502; 132-726-025-958-856; 148-238-031-427-929; 152-236-364-100-452; 162-222-438-190-637; 183-910-135-809-990; 195-459-088-993-271; 195-835-968-708-439; 199-865-975-232-830,28,false,,

The present paper examines to what extent this development is caused by domestic political and economic factors on the one hand, and international policy diffusion via competitive interaction of governments on the other. Employing a comprehensive index of economic reform it can be shown that policy diffusion is a driving factor for economic liberalization. Especially in the fields of regulatory, monetary and trade policies we find significant interdependence of policy choices, as suggested by theories of policy diffusion.",132,1,159,178,Economic policy; Economy; Macroeconomics; Economics; Public finance; Policy studies; Index (economics); Economic expansion; Economic liberalization; Liberalization; Race (biology); Politics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/pubcho/v132y2007i1p159-178.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:kap:pubcho:v:132:y:2007:i:1:p:159-178 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-006-9140-y https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11127-006-9140-y.pdf https://www.jstor.org/stable/27698133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11127-006-9140-y,,10.1007/s11127-006-9140-y,2031184985,,0,004-937-144-600-557; 005-249-461-623-469; 007-748-315-099-75X; 010-278-292-671-040; 014-359-498-293-225; 025-193-488-999-63X; 027-824-183-658-202; 034-539-306-554-94X; 042-335-426-642-552; 042-929-620-693-060; 046-127-203-871-082; 046-127-440-118-73X; 048-790-058-133-158; 050-671-315-820-339; 053-209-420-900-188; 058-593-953-269-924; 065-214-102-471-762; 066-938-169-118-066; 068-905-690-168-04X; 073-753-993-648-180; 074-979-529-464-685; 075-801-927-284-039; 076-560-290-467-816; 077-926-704-396-107; 085-438-163-894-038; 087-248-023-920-180; 088-993-237-313-315; 093-123-711-764-984; 096-125-944-826-566; 096-243-179-953-548; 099-417-691-626-120; 101-822-093-855-635; 111-339-417-081-588; 114-740-023-841-548; 126-693-151-284-201; 126-757-491-197-825; 133-068-634-776-681; 138-686-113-462-150; 147-089-416-239-045; 150-744-390-311-614; 152-071-415-951-300; 152-878-717-952-605; 153-624-972-546-125; 167-857-466-018-368; 175-898-440-962-466; 176-542-423-770-525; 178-046-562-062-684; 184-679-427-908-250; 185-327-956-961-556,119,false,,

First, work in each area can benefit from a greater focus on the changing interactions between the various mechanisms involved in diffusion/transfer. Second, the diffusion literature privileges structure, while the transfer literature privileges agency, but we need an approach which recognizes the dialectical relationship between the two. Third, the diffusion literature concentrates on pattern-finding, while the transfer literature examines process-tracing, but any full explanation of transfer/diffusion needs to do both. Fourth, both literatures suffer from skewed case selection with, in particular, too little attention paid to developing countries. Finally, while both literatures need to be interested in whether diffusion/transfer is likely to be successful/unsuccessful, neither considers any criteria that might be us...",30,3,269,288,Public economics; Agency (philosophy); Positive economics; Dialectic; Diffusion (business); Economics; Structure (mathematical logic); Policy transfer; Focus (linguistics); Structure and agency; Developing country,,,,,https://researchprofiles.canberra.edu.au/en/publications/policy-diffusion-and-policy-transfer https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01442870902863851 https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/17868 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01442870902863851 https://core.ac.uk/display/143884430 https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/28591 https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/17868,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01442870902863851,,10.1080/01442870902863851,2052684449,,0,003-542-105-072-533; 003-785-981-401-874; 004-379-868-674-339; 005-422-051-250-176; 008-414-059-072-131; 010-178-466-935-635; 010-297-483-353-575; 011-497-790-292-357; 012-562-267-270-940; 016-634-173-735-220; 017-010-933-750-388; 018-636-637-701-128; 026-573-703-383-442; 028-925-679-709-711; 033-551-722-267-54X; 033-852-662-613-736; 035-261-961-935-32X; 038-576-001-630-807; 046-817-612-277-752; 047-269-907-857-959; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-146-132-370-77X; 049-219-615-824-319; 050-274-654-059-514; 053-271-230-795-943; 055-532-729-324-361; 059-850-774-734-000; 063-267-154-988-831; 063-344-519-222-73X; 063-400-296-712-427; 064-980-246-016-490; 065-666-299-776-558; 067-490-686-317-462; 070-365-824-959-398; 072-862-908-678-93X; 074-465-905-471-400; 075-428-805-584-444; 076-202-934-875-795; 077-926-704-396-107; 083-462-616-813-614; 084-022-394-011-890; 084-169-954-038-749; 093-190-746-631-057; 094-364-646-339-458; 105-535-407-163-361; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-513-543-976-791; 125-268-617-755-543; 128-150-266-973-359; 130-592-937-000-903; 139-186-190-548-754; 142-238-493-820-065; 146-213-796-969-064; 148-483-078-028-406; 173-567-809-531-297; 178-281-811-917-98X; 180-864-930-572-335; 182-722-299-803-232; 184-002-509-422-209; 184-422-743-876-664,424,false,,
115-773-422-000-09X,Laboratory federalism: Policy diusion and yardstick competition,,2011,,,,,,Simon Schnyder,"The concept of ”laboratory federalism”, coined by Oates (1999), states that federations and more generally politically decentralized countries may benefit from better policies than centralized countries, thanks to a greater efficiency in identifying the best policies. Indeed, multiple small scale experimentation may foster the identification of the best policies, and reduce the aggregate risk of experimentation. The basic intuition behind this result is that the implementation of a given policy in a region generate an informational externality which allows the other regions to learn about the quality and/or adequacy of this policy. This process of learning is likely to generate better outcomes than if policy making were made by a single decision maker for all regions. In this paper I propose to explore another possible driver of policy learning in a federation. Indeed, I show that yardstick competition is an important source of policy diffusion. However, it may also have perverse effects, ∗Department of Economics, University of Fribourg, 1700 Fribourg (Switzerland), simon.schnyder@unifr.ch †University fo Rennes 1 and CREM-CNRS (France)",,,,,Public economics; Intuition; Externality; Economics; Policy learning; Decision maker; Policy making; Federalism; Systematic risk; Yardstick,,,,,https://is.muni.cz/do/econ/soubory/katedry/kve/6403220/25140474/labo1.pdf,https://is.muni.cz/do/econ/soubory/katedry/kve/6403220/25140474/labo1.pdf,,,2188097431,,0,007-473-916-663-352; 010-793-799-125-045; 032-426-851-844-332; 036-148-643-592-853; 043-277-881-830-110; 044-530-924-902-261; 051-751-057-409-518; 068-710-421-676-61X; 076-635-429-533-755; 120-619-032-136-245; 122-270-156-405-80X; 127-460-733-883-537; 157-003-040-712-991,2,false,,

Checchi; Galen R. Sevcik; Karen D. Loch; Detmar W. Straub,"How do national ICT policies disseminate in a country? Why would there be a differential awareness of policies among various sectors and/or professions? These are the two major research questions addressed in the study reported here. Motivation for ICT adoption and use, it is argued, will generally be influenced by the set of policies on which certain sectors or professional-groups focus. This, in turn will influence the nature of development of the ICT industry within the nation. The study uses quantitative techniques to assess sectoral differences in the diffusion of national ICT policies in Egypt by gauging the awareness of ICT policies by key decision makers within each major economic sector. Interviews with 33 top-ranking government and IT-sector executives are used to elicit the key ICT policies. These policies were then further studied in interviews with 47 policy-makers and private sector managers who form the respondent base for this study. Findings show a skewed distribution of awareness of national ICT policy diffusion and that, as predicted, this distribution is related to sector-affiliation. Thus, the sets of policies that are closest to the inherent interests of chosen sectors and professional affiliations are identified. The findings suggest that correctly positioning ICT policies can be a critical element for the implementation of national strategies that shape the direction and pace of a country-wide development of ICT capabilities and capacity. This is especially so in developing countries, where the effects of ICTs in leveraging economic and social development are deemed to be substantial.",23,23,3,,Public economics; Public policy; Private sector; Government; Economic sector; Economics; Respondent; Public relations; Distribution (economics); Information and Communications Technology; Developing country,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1418098 http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/view/187/145,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1418098,,,2129919170,,0,008-361-204-868-843; 009-335-612-398-622; 033-985-645-687-273; 038-337-918-778-717; 043-366-225-220-474; 059-207-885-249-62X; 079-141-981-849-680; 087-247-779-886-168; 097-460-023-406-027; 112-141-198-034-425,8,false,,

However, transgender concerns as such have received little attention. As transgender activism has become more visible, policymakers, both in the United States and around the world, have begun to respond to demands for more equitable treatment. Jami K. Taylor and Donald P. Haider-Markel bring together new research employing the concepts and tools of political science to explore the politics of transgender rights. Volume contributors address the framing of transgender rights in the U.S. and in Latin America. They discuss transgender interest groups, the inclusion of transgender activists in advocacy coalitions, policy diffusion at the state and local levels, and, importantly, the implementation of transgender public policy. This volume sets the standard for empirical research on transgender politics and demonstrates that the study of this topic can contribute to the understanding of larger questions in the field of political science.",,,,,Gender studies; Public policy; Empirical research; Latin Americans; Framing (social sciences); Political science; Morality; Sexual orientation; Transgender; Politics,,,,,https://www.press.umich.edu/4883502 https://muse.jhu.edu/book/36857 http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1434888,http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/mpub.4883502,,10.3998/mpub.4883502,2283978923,,0,,31,false,,

Why have so many countries with so little in common adopted the same policy so rapidly? This extensive diffusion is particularly puzzling given the lack of evidence that AML policies actually work. In explaining the international spread of AML policies, this article draws on recent literature from International Relations, sociology, comparative politics, and public policy dealing with policy diffusion and policy transfer, but also differs from most of this work in two key aspects: First, it is argued that the process of diffusion in the developing world has been much more power-based than voluntary. Second, the mechanisms driving policy diffusion (direct coercion, mimicry, and competition) are all shown to be discursively mediated exercises of power, rather than reflecting rational learning or brute material forces.

117-034-571-919-909,From re-education to child protection: an analysis of cantonal policy norms in Switzerland 1970-2018,,,,,,,,Thomas Reiss,"Child placement policies have undergone considerable change in many Western European countries in the last decades. From taking away children without due process and abuse in foster homes and families to the inclusion of experts in decision-making and reducing informal arrangements, many countries made significant changes. The long-standing conservative-authoritarian norm that predominated child welfare policies has slowly but certainly been replaced by a norm that centers around child protection. State intervention in parental care is highly delicate as it interferes with one of the most private areas of private life: the education of children. In the federal system of Switzerland the 26 subnational units, the cantons, enjoy a large degree of autonomy in social policies, which results in great heterogeneity across cantons. As the subnational policy diversity in this field has so far not been analyzed for all cantons longitudinally, we collected the first comprehensive data set to do this. With this innovative data set we aim to answer the question what drives the adoption of child protection policy norms in Switzerland in the last 50 years. Subnational policymaking operates under a certain pressure to harmonize, while at the same time, leaving considerable room for maneuver for the cantons to adopt solutions that fit best for them. Due to the smalls size of many cantons, they coordinate and cooperate on a regular basis with each other in various policy fields. I thus argue that participation and frequency of Intergovernmental Meetings promotes the adoption of new policy norms. I furthermore argue that phases of politicization lead to policy norm adoption. The paper contributes twofold. First, it provides the first comprehensive analysis of a policy norm change for a social care policy that is crucial to gender roles in Western societies. Second, it applies policy norm diffusion to the subnational level and thereby advances the policy diffusion literature.",,,17,,Welfare; Norm (social); Inclusion (education); Political science; Child protection; Diversity (business); Development economics; Federalism; Intervention (law); Autonomy,,,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/206810/ https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/206810/1/ZORA206810.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5167/uzh-206810,,10.5167/uzh-206810,3203307698,,0,,0,false,,

Healthcare financing data used for this study were retrieved from the 2014 version of OECD Health Statistics database. Our results suggest that the public share of total healthcare financing in nine OECD countries has exhibited signs of co-movement over the period of 1960-2012 in the short, medium, and long-runs. The public-private mix of healthcare financing in National Health Service (NHS) systems led those in the Social Health Insurance (SHI) and Private Health Insurance (PHI) systems in the short and medium-runs, while the public-private mix of healthcare financing in the PHI health care system lagged behind that of the SHI and NHS systems over the period of 1960-2012. Policy diffusion for any change in the public-private mix of healthcare financing should run from public financing healthcare systems (such as the SHI and NHS systems) to the private financing healthcare system (PHI system).",,3,40,56,Finance; Health care; Economics; Public finance; Health insurance; National health service; Health statistics; Oecd countries; Healthcare financing; Economic growth; Social determinants of health,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/rjr/romjef/vy2016i3p40-56.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:rjr:romjef:v::y:2016:i:3:p:40-56,https://ideas.repec.org/a/rjr/romjef/vy2016i3p40-56.html,,,2560565542,,0,,2,false,,

While the terminology and focus often vary, all of these studies are concerned with a similar process in which knowledge about policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in one political setting (past or present) is used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in another political setting.; ; Given that this is a growing phenomenon, it is something that anyone studying public policy needs to consider. As such, this article is divided into four major sections. The first section briefly considers the extent of, and reasons for, the growth of policy transfer. The second section then outlines a framework for the analysis of transfer. From here a third section presents a continuum for distinguishing between different types of policy transfer.

We argue that emulation and competition have led to the process of policy diffusion between these two countries.

Policy transfer in this area is still relatively under-researched and is a puzzling case for a number of reasons: first, regional policy is inward-oriented, as it targets the catching up of regions with prevailing national economic and social standards; second, as a place-based policy, regional policy is intrinsically context-specific, as both policy responses and outcomes are connected to the unique situation of each given territorial reality; third, its distributive (and often redistributive) nature make regional policy reliant on complex multi-level governmental negotiations; lastly, its strategic goals, thematic scope and financial scale are largely affected by the national levels of economic development, which differ vastly between the Western world and the emerging economies. This background notwithstanding, knowledge exchange and policy transfer have successfully taken place between the EU and Brazil and between the EU and China since the mid- 2000s. This has happened through institutionalized, concrete activities, which have delivered tangible outcomes on the regional policy frameworks of Brazil and China. This study discusses and compares the reasons for engagement in such unlikely policy learning effort; identifies the mechanism of policy transfer and their degree of institutionalization; and reflects on the conditions that have made this case of policy diffusion more or less successful, drawing comparative lessons from the two experiences. The study is based on semistructured interviews, surveys, participant observation and informal exchanges during high-level seminars (EUChina, EU-Brazil) and analyses of strategic documents and legislation.",,,,,Public policy; Policy analysis; Political economy; Political science; Foreign policy analysis; Policy studies; Regional policy; Policy transfer; European union; Economic growth; Education policy,,,,,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/59146/ https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/eu-china-and-eu-brazil-cross-national-policy-transfer-and-learnin,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/59146/,,,2583750019,,0,,0,false,,

In the last two decades green open space referenda have become a popular way of conserving land among subnational governments. The research conceptualizes green open space referenda as an information source that triggers inter municipal interactions. Three questions related to green open space referenda were examined in this dissertation. The research focused on two expenditures related questions. The effect of green open space referenda on own expenditures and the expenditures of neighboring governments was examined. The third question explored the mechanisms of policy diffusion active in the regional spread of green open space referenda. The study adopted a distinct research design for each of the three questions. The question on the diffusion mechanisms was addressed through qualitative research methodology, which included field interviews and content analysis in a case study area. The effect of referenda on own expenditures was examined through an interrupted time series research design. The effect of green open space referenda on neighbors’ expenditures was estimated using spatial regression methods. Conclusions from case study identify policy learning and incentives as dominant diffusion mechanisms for green open space referenda. In the case study area county governments were identified as leaders in initiating local government green open space policies. Empirical conclusions show that referenda positively affect the expenditures of local governments. Post referendum, there is an increase in the per capita expenditures on green space goods. The analysis shows that the presence of green open space referenda influences neighbors’ expenditures. However the magnitude of the effect varies over time and is contingent on inter municipal distance. County’s green open space program and previous county green open space referenda influence the reaction of neighboring governments. The study has found that green open space referenda encourage intermunicipal strategic interactions that have policy and expenditure implications.",,,,,Public economics; Per capita; Public good; Economics; Content analysis; Space (commercial competition); Amenity; Local government; Referendum; Incentive,,,,,,,,,2204388334,,0,095-794-891-049-434,0,false,,

It tracks three critical conjunctures of social protection for the poor in which Indonesia tried to adapt cash transfer schemes and institutional frameworks, and eventually consolidated the social protection system.

Should they translate their increasing economic strength into political power to further developing countries' interests in lower levels of international patent protection? Or, anticipating a rising domestic interest in stronger international patent protection, should they adopt a position that favours maximal patent protection? Drawing on multiple case studies using a most-similar system design, we argue that rising economies, after having been coerced into adopting more stringent patent standards, tend to display ambivalent positions, trapped in bureaucratic politics and caught between conflicting domestic constituencies. We find that the recent proliferation of international institutions and the expansion of transnational networks have contributed to fragmentation and polarisation in domestic patent politics. As a result, today's emerging economies experience a more tortuous transformative process than did yesterday's. This finding is of particular relevance for scholars studying rising powers, as well as for those working on policy diffusion, regulatory regimes, transnational networks and regime complexes.",,,,,Emerging markets; Economy; Economics; Position (finance); Power (social and political); Dilemma; Intellectual property; Bureaucracy; Developing country; Politics,,,,,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3032903 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3032903,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3032903,,,3167287666,,0,,0,false,,

Cook; Seung-Ho An; Nathan Favero,"Interdependence in the decision making or behaviors of various organizations and administrators is often neglected in the study of public administration. Failing to account for such interdependence risks an incomplete understanding of the choices made by these actors and agencies. As such, we show how researchers analyzing cross-sectional or time-series-cross-sectional (TSCS) data can utilize spatial econometric methods to improve inference on existing questions, and, more interestingly, engage a new set of theoretical questions. Specifically, we articulate several general mechanisms for spatial dependence that are likely to appear in research on public administration (isomorphism, competition, benchmarking, and common exposure). We then demonstrate how these mechanisms can be tested using spatial econometric models in two applications: first, a cross-sectional study of district-level bilingual education spending and, second, a TSCS analysis on state-level health care administration. In our presentation, we also briefly discuss many of the practical challenges confronted in estimating spatial models (e.g., weights specification, model selection, effects calculation) and offer some guidance on each.",29,4,591,608,Health administration; Economics; Set (psychology); Econometric model; Inference; Competition (economics); Public administration; Isomorphism (sociology); Benchmarking; Model selection,,,,,https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/29/4/591/5087674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muy050,,10.1093/jopart/muy050,2889379493,,0,001-300-907-145-103; 001-460-763-118-52X; 002-090-110-364-521; 007-625-265-744-668; 007-688-429-359-634; 007-748-315-099-75X; 011-442-289-332-011; 012-694-793-071-268; 013-187-921-004-271; 016-251-144-798-048; 016-544-327-940-704; 017-069-450-748-415; 017-566-832-083-946; 017-664-422-859-843; 017-751-153-694-467; 018-320-455-212-605; 021-827-414-463-927; 022-396-203-310-351; 022-512-643-506-628; 026-834-719-073-433; 030-489-764-186-453; 030-494-319-931-618; 033-095-549-902-282; 033-551-582-037-995; 036-448-181-441-739; 039-389-860-012-890; 041-658-614-339-032; 043-672-991-768-581; 044-853-254-677-574; 049-960-438-989-906; 052-020-053-224-679; 055-586-405-426-429; 060-979-637-414-361; 061-549-812-643-636; 063-081-395-547-273; 065-716-313-886-722; 068-188-048-575-271; 071-828-856-837-031; 073-753-993-648-180; 079-154-303-736-305; 079-534-814-246-134; 081-386-051-205-659; 082-017-566-839-450; 087-198-445-696-526; 088-155-797-806-158; 088-665-707-744-409; 090-515-415-329-578; 093-976-962-761-459; 097-499-941-349-568; 098-937-352-111-694; 101-808-810-392-557; 102-490-342-063-275; 106-973-132-763-03X; 114-297-985-479-03X; 115-482-499-323-938; 120-467-169-774-758; 120-769-607-299-082; 127-539-841-332-937; 136-993-141-215-111; 137-849-796-205-184; 140-114-889-760-495; 142-376-795-258-499; 150-372-244-980-17X; 163-625-920-556-222; 170-031-736-759-615; 175-898-237-450-246; 190-966-309-599-871,8,false,,

Available evidence suggests that cross-national policy diffusion is an increasingly significant phenomenon, especially in the European context. While internationalisation of policy discourses and expert communities are regarded as key driving forces of policy diffusion, public management reforms are also said to be particularly vulnerable to mechanisms of 'diffusion without convergence'. This paper analyses the case of policies aiming at reducing administrative burdens of regulations through the lens of the literature on policy diffusion. The diffusion of the so-called Standard Cost Model for measuring administrative burden between 2003 and 2007 is used as a case to explore the mechanisms facilitating policy diffusion in this domain. The analysis reveals patterns of rapid diffusion. This policy boom has been driven by a combination of different mechanisms of policy diffusion rather than by a single driving factor.",,,,,Public economics; Policy analysis; Diffusion (business); Boom; Economics; Policy studies; Convergence (economics); Regulatory reform; Context (language use); Internationalization,,,,,https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/36536/ https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ehl:lserod:36536,https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/36536/,,,58366732,,0,,3,false,,

As Levi Faur and Vigoda-Gadot point out, “Policy lessons are increasingly drawn on a cross-national basis rather than on national experience” (2006, p. 248). Despite growing interest in these fields, few researchers have included a time variable in their analyses. This means that the results of these research projects have been limited to findings at the moment of diffusion or transfer, and have excluded long-term analysis. This paper analyzes the “Manutencion” program, previously the National Higher Education Scholarship Program or Pronabes, which address inequality in access to higher education in Mexico. The empirical data shows that a more detailed and consistent explanation of a policy transfer process should consider the time variable, which is absent in the analysis of authors such as Dolowitz and Marsh (2000), Marsh and Sharman (2009) or Richard Rose (1991). I propose the following argument: Including the time variable will broaden the frame of analysis of the process of diffusion/transfer, resulting in the consideration of diverse elements that will help to achieve a richer explanation; these include the different moments in which a transfer uses information from international sources, the Resumen En los ultimos anos, conceptos como “aprendizaje”, “difusion” y “transferencia” han tomado relevancia en el analisis de politicas publicas.

A pesar del creciente interes en estos campos de estudio, pocos investigadores han incluido la variable tiempo en sus analisis.

The spread of medical marijuana offers the opportunity to take a closer look at whether policy and political learning occur during diffusion. An increasing number of states have adopted medical marijuana policies in defiance of federal prohibition and in the space created by federal inactivity. Furthermore, early adopting states have adapted their programs to account for changes in the industry and to coincide with recreational marijuana programs. This article sheds light on how the laws have evolved over time due to policy learning, political learning, and local adaptation. Specifically, we review how states have incorporated best practices from others (policy learning) and how the laws have been repackaged in more politically conservative states (political learning). Finally, we show how states adapt to medical marijuana laws by using precedents from the regulation of other industries.</jats:p>",50,3,344,369,Political economy; Political science; Politics,,,,,http://academic.oup.com/publius/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/publius/pjaa006/5819235 https://academic.oup.com/publius/article/50/3/344/5819235 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/policy-and-political-learning-the-development-of-medical-marijuan,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/publius/pjaa006,,10.1093/publius/pjaa006,3016222664,,0,000-189-814-875-538; 001-125-166-587-565; 002-059-307-024-20X; 004-178-055-847-65X; 004-582-874-807-146; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-722-686-316-360; 009-144-032-678-255; 010-168-515-464-237; 013-332-573-194-416; 015-684-623-822-866; 015-765-163-150-580; 017-212-243-836-69X; 018-454-798-334-448; 024-986-027-844-815; 027-006-960-624-070; 031-844-787-466-124; 033-969-989-312-301; 034-047-186-719-840; 034-431-213-473-281; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-431-616-792-545; 039-664-709-632-96X; 041-099-885-505-647; 043-187-297-883-142; 044-999-296-093-384; 047-848-215-864-88X; 051-925-465-626-092; 053-388-075-059-952; 057-621-004-140-001; 059-274-660-526-403; 062-081-229-874-723; 062-849-708-836-500; 063-504-944-027-038; 066-502-630-137-787; 068-209-419-102-669; 071-386-896-041-710; 073-166-408-788-371; 077-495-223-631-426; 080-285-338-290-10X; 080-443-369-063-293; 082-607-767-711-613; 083-128-427-871-272; 088-855-442-431-278; 089-478-632-678-39X; 094-331-326-259-773; 097-499-941-349-568; 107-941-076-712-51X; 112-333-966-495-520; 113-694-044-022-938; 115-458-536-203-346; 118-513-543-976-791; 137-879-915-946-717; 139-382-636-815-772; 150-003-837-690-609; 154-633-354-475-068; 156-120-996-742-091; 156-370-106-390-963; 184-435-516-788-966; 192-918-590-944-791,9,true,,bronze

Savage,"Most students of policy diffusion have noted that new policies have tended to be adopted by most American states in ever shorter time spans in the twentieth century. Historically, rapid policy diffusion has usually occurred only when the federal government has served as a central propagating agency, especially when it has used the incentive of grant funds. In the past decade, however, a number of policies have diffused rapidly (i.e., thirty or more states adopting in one to five years, with little or no central propagation). During 1983–1984, two such policies were laws mandating child passenger restraints and lemon-aid laws. Two broad agenda items, education reform and driving while intoxicated, also received much attention in 1984. A variety of specific policies were enacted in a majority of the states. It would appear that some problems become so widespread today that proffered solutions are readily snapped up by state governments as though the policies were ones whose “time has come.” The rapidity of their diffusion seems limited primarily by their “fragility,” that is, the degree of perceived organized resistance to their adoption.",15,3,111,126,Agency (sociology); Variety (cybernetics); Political economy; Government; Political science; Law; State (polity); Incentive; Poison control; Resistance (psychoanalysis); Education reform,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3329981 https://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.viewdetails&citationIds[]=citjournalarticle_243831_38 https://academic.oup.com/publius/article-abstract/15/3/111/1939925,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a037550,,10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a037550,2039941237,,0,,31,false,,

A growing number of member states and regions within the member states oppose the EU’s agro-biotechnology policy, resulting in a complex multi-level structure of policy-making. This study is interested in the regional opposition to GMOs and scrutinises the determinants of membership in the European Network of GMO-free Regions. In terms of theory, this study builds on the literature of policy diffusion. For the analytical purpose, we distinguish among four diffusion mechanisms: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate regions, imitation of economically powerful regions and deviation from national law. Our research questions are the following: How has membership developed since the foundation of the network? Which mechanisms explain the diffusion patterns observed? The empirical findings show that membership in the network has grown substantially between 2003 and 2014, which supports...",19,6,743,759,Imitation; Economy; Political science; Economic geography; Opposition (politics); European union; Economic competition; Member states; Research questions; Diffusion (acoustics),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/jriskr/v19y2016i6p743-759.html http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/31194 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13669877.2015.1034161 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:taf:jriskr:v:19:y:2016:i:6:p:743-759 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13669877.2015.1034161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2015.1034161,,10.1080/13669877.2015.1034161,2085143429,,0,002-874-600-010-545; 003-432-406-318-659; 005-655-725-159-983; 006-722-686-316-360; 007-407-689-788-669; 008-606-010-147-143; 009-000-289-372-814; 009-073-796-260-718; 009-687-673-086-912; 009-714-828-052-815; 009-789-449-911-655; 011-497-790-292-357; 011-960-403-697-162; 012-906-376-757-375; 017-124-257-575-080; 020-534-098-901-255; 021-581-792-446-246; 022-041-426-334-446; 023-302-344-871-95X; 023-962-702-363-79X; 025-140-678-775-072; 030-760-006-230-879; 031-884-996-580-501; 032-235-898-751-342; 033-627-766-688-598; 033-960-731-161-349; 041-071-075-510-220; 045-274-554-571-288; 046-162-416-107-639; 047-647-152-528-780; 049-509-477-487-937; 054-958-429-791-699; 055-361-888-139-573; 058-019-200-606-336; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-668-244-624-560; 061-855-489-336-69X; 061-973-970-085-871; 062-950-099-342-922; 064-505-239-656-93X; 068-425-738-755-997; 069-579-284-890-999; 073-457-194-695-857; 075-662-693-357-591; 076-804-574-636-018; 077-945-151-328-246; 083-128-427-871-272; 084-910-340-397-172; 085-454-397-782-098; 085-537-648-591-397; 087-676-517-727-373; 090-681-085-645-634; 091-681-808-822-97X; 091-871-348-377-488; 092-091-324-278-484; 097-975-338-145-514; 098-766-626-402-082; 099-439-282-095-688; 117-400-350-564-152; 117-677-347-760-402; 129-641-750-453-42X; 144-402-289-149-571; 148-460-439-813-652; 154-314-204-508-516; 156-586-921-097-184; 159-232-862-444-828; 161-072-548-284-725; 165-365-808-288-090; 170-227-643-787-195; 171-822-324-742-62X; 172-689-180-005-845; 180-409-708-070-348; 188-007-362-092-361; 189-671-447-217-604,10,false,,

The paper gives a critical overview of macro-level management efforts to increase energy efficiency in Russia in 1995-2013 with special focus on the shift in goals, methods and approaches. We compare the pace and the trend of evolution of Russian ener- gy efficiency policy with world trends and discuss the effects of policy diffusion on interna- tional and regional levels. Research aim. Using the conceptual framework of an extended energy-efficiency gap, this study investigates the existing barriers to energy efficiency and suggests the possible solu- tions for improvement of energy policy on regional level. Method. We gathered the information for evaluation of effectiveness of current energy  policy by empirical research in the form of a mix of medium-scale face-to-face inquiries and  semi-structured interviews. Reg findings. The findings reveal that the most common barrier is the lack of expertise and competences to identify the inefficiencies, and opportunities to implement energy efficiency measures needs to be overcome first for further improvement of energy efficiency. The convergence of expertise can happen through horizontal interactions on regional level as well as specially organized training programs at the federal level with the participation of international experts.",13,2,51,71,Public economics; Empirical research; Energy policy; Environmental economics; Economics; Efficient energy use; Convergence (economics); Pace; The Conceptual Framework; Macro level; Energy management,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ekon-element-000171356831 https://www.ejournals.eu/ijcm/2014/13(2)/art/5220/,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ekon-element-000171356831,,,1541863825,,0,005-723-286-474-712; 011-620-909-604-41X; 012-327-519-682-846; 014-579-616-653-741; 015-234-339-257-785; 016-220-448-083-779; 023-693-891-410-854; 025-260-257-143-321; 026-544-962-212-020; 027-192-775-772-057; 027-363-582-450-91X; 028-990-710-648-648; 031-044-114-336-020; 033-350-553-052-837; 041-451-848-591-961; 046-046-201-496-720; 048-243-185-408-756; 052-016-769-698-747; 052-536-341-057-729; 061-553-569-705-105; 063-643-701-913-238; 078-130-244-158-871; 080-431-999-812-596; 084-827-816-328-459; 085-216-989-951-883; 090-874-669-983-03X; 101-963-758-850-02X; 104-903-137-825-029; 144-358-085-057-856; 144-957-937-780-759; 146-691-130-080-433; 161-122-698-375-844; 172-653-152-614-77X; 178-923-629-171-052; 180-813-779-294-458,1,false,,

Anderson; Diana Silver; James Macinko,"This article examines the diffusion of U.S. state child passenger safety laws, analyzing over-time changes and inter-state differences in all identifiable features of laws that plausibly influence crash-related morbidity and mortality. The observed trend shows many states' continuing efforts to update their laws to be consistent with latest motor vehicle safety recommendations, with each state modifying their laws on average 6 times over the 30-year period. However, there has been a considerable time lag in knowledge diffusion and policy adoption. Even though empirical evidence supporting the protective effect of child restraint devices was available in the early 1970s, laws requiring their use were not adopted by all 50 states until 1986. For laws requiring minors to be seated in rear seats, the first state law adoption did not occur until two decades after the evidence became publicly available. As of 2010, only 12 states explicitly required the use of booster seats, 9 for infant seats and 6 for toddler seats. There is also great variation among states in defining the child population to be covered by the laws, the vehicle operators subject to compliance, and the penalties resulting from non-compliance. Some states cover only up to 4-year-olds while others cover children up to age 17. As of 2010, states have as many as 14 exemptions, such as those for non-residents, non-parents, commercial vehicles, large vehicles, or vehicles without seatbelts. Factors such as the complexity of the state of the science, the changing nature of guidelines (from age to height/weight-related criteria), and the absence of coordinated federal actions are potential explanations for the observed patterns. The resulting uneven policy landscape among states suggests a strong need for improved communication among state legislators, public health researchers, advocates and concerned citizen groups to promote more efficient and effective policymaking.",100,,30,37,Public policy; Policy analysis; Business; Empirical evidence; Occupational safety and health; Law; State (polity); Public health law; Poison control; Intervention (law),Child passenger safety law; Child restraint; Policy diffusion; Public health law; Seatbelt law; Traffic safety; United States,"Adolescent; Automobile Driving/legislation & jurisprudence; Child; Child Restraint Systems; Child, Preschool; Humans; Infant; Public Policy; Safety/legislation & jurisprudence; United States",,NIAAA NIH HHS (R01 AA021436) United States; NIAAA NIH HHS (1R01AA021436-01) United States,https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/child-passenger-safety-laws-in-the-united-states-1978-2010-policy https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444836 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:socmed:v:100:y:2014:i:c:p:30-37 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3899584/table/T2/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3899584 https://trid.trb.org/view/1290899 https://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.viewdetails&citationIds[]=citjournalarticle_428022_19 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613005832 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v100y2014icp30-37.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613005832 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24444836/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.10.035,24444836,10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.10.035,2101104165,PMC3899584,0,000-049-919-834-869; 001-813-066-837-888; 002-843-038-646-607; 005-679-822-144-894; 006-990-713-532-087; 007-868-597-739-36X; 008-895-854-537-364; 011-288-467-293-869; 011-756-029-933-453; 012-791-714-147-741; 013-430-533-803-247; 013-587-338-811-706; 014-676-878-005-95X; 016-191-083-689-750; 019-977-835-113-919; 023-545-073-064-932; 024-128-034-242-352; 026-168-335-928-197; 027-866-191-788-029; 028-445-364-787-579; 030-074-364-684-846; 036-349-334-296-672; 042-669-759-681-242; 043-310-553-577-859; 048-061-730-093-124; 049-430-601-815-490; 049-531-514-726-724; 057-059-427-020-874; 057-113-428-458-557; 057-524-550-119-053; 057-548-915-496-027; 062-158-747-618-255; 071-142-992-599-684; 076-398-442-774-477; 100-855-557-048-853; 101-488-954-100-242; 105-526-785-996-251; 108-599-797-997-485; 109-372-485-690-628; 123-858-104-075-89X; 131-882-460-373-439; 132-739-743-625-709; 150-913-876-330-019; 155-580-858-393-517; 163-235-703-150-011; 163-637-734-144-951; 169-334-772-547-655; 178-789-721-748-809; 185-930-684-647-657; 188-682-157-816-198,33,true,,green

In this work, we propose to explore the diffusion of social policies in Brazil, a; country recently redemocratized and also a highly decentralized federation. The work also; breaks new ground by examining the role of internal and external factors in policy diffusion; using an unconventional analysis unit, or local governments. Interestingly, the 1988 Brazilian; Constitution recognizes municipalities as autonomous jurisdictions, giving them considerable; powers in relation to public policies. In order to advance in the explanation of both internal; and external determinants of policy diffusion in Brazil, employ a cross section analysis of the; three years in question, using the data on one of the country's social policies, the Way to; School Program.

Two of the three chapters of this thesis explore the former, respectively investigating (i) domestic political economy constraints and (ii) processes of policy diffusion across jurisdictions. One chapter focuses on the latter, advancing methodologies for the identification of firm-level innovation in (GHG- reducing) electricity supply technologies.; ; A key empirical contribution of this thesis, presented in the first chapter, is the construction and calculation of an average (emissions-weighted) price of carbon for the jurisdictions under study, which shows, among other insights, that the world average price remains extremely low, at about 1.5USD/tCO2e in 2018. In addition, the analysis in this chapter suggests that (i) political economy factors primarily affected policy implementation and (ii) policy stringency is a highly persistent process.; ; Our next chapter investigates policy diffusion processes and proposes that these are related to an alteration of the net payoffs of domestic climate policy and an update on the information about the benefits (or costs) of policy adoption derived from the adoption of a similar policy or the deployment of abatement technology in foreign juris- dictions. The evidence suggests that technology demonstration and learning from past policy experience positively affect (domestic) policy developments.; ; The last chapter focuses on the identification of (GHG-abating) electricity supply technologies using a machine learning search strategy based on patents’ title and abstract. This approach highlighted the role of “lateral"" innovation in the development of some electricity generation technologies. In addition, by linking the identified patent set to legal entities, we uncover the role of firms’ technological entry and exit in technology transition and shed light on the business structure of technologically active entities.; ; The present work allowed me to address fundamental questions pertaining to the design of climate change mitigation strategies. First, our results stress the importance of the sequence of introduction of the climate policies, suggesting that policies weakening incumbents’ political and economic influence might foster subsequent implementation of more stringent policies. Second, given the weakness of most existing carbon pricing schemes, a rationale for the development of climate mitigation strategies with multiple GHG abatement tools continues to exist. Third, mechanisms of policy diffusion at play could prove highly valuable when seeking to introduce carbonpricing mechanisms in new jurisdictions. Finally, we point at the need to target public support to sustain the stream of GHG-abating electricity supply technologies primarily at new (technological) entrants.This thesis was supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council",,,,,Economics; Natural resource economics; Climate policy; Climate change mitigation,,,,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/304802,http://dx.doi.org/10.17863/cam.51884,,10.17863/cam.51884,3042330217,,0,,0,false,,

Since the 1980s, “entrepreneurial government” which emphasizes Schumpeter’s notion of entrepreneurship has been adopted by various administrative reforms. It implies that public sector should promote innovative ideas for service delivery. However, innovation does not necessarily have to start from ground zero, such as introducing market mechanism and managerial tools into government, benchmarking, or improvements in operation procedures are also innovations. Thus, innovation in public sector involves both policy learning and policy diffusion. The critical issues are: How can innovative policy be diffused? What are the factors influence policy diffusion? Does policy diffusion also involve policy learning? Taichung County is the first local government in Taiwan to implement the Bookstart program through its township libraries. Since 2003, Bookstart program has been gradually diffused among these township libraries. Nowadays, all the twenty-one township libraries in Taichung County have participated in the Bookstart program. Consequentially, the Ministry of Education had decided to promote the program as a national policy in 2009. Using Taichung County as a case, this thesis examines the diffusion of the Bookstart Program by emphasizing the impacts of policy learning, the internal resources and external environment of township library, and the efforts of higher level of government and Non-profit organization (Hsin-Yi Foundation) on the diffusion of the program. This study utilizes in-depth interview, the interviewees include eight township librarians, one official from the County’s Bureau of Cultural Affairs, and one member from the Hsin-Yi Foundation. This research reveals that the two main reasons for the successful diffusion of Bookstart program. The first is the interactions among township libraries, Hsin-Yi Foundation, and the Bureau of Cultural Affairs. In addition of information sharing, they also involve policy learning from each other. The second is the supportive attitudes of the stakeholders. As for the external conditions, all of the librarians agree that the financial status of recipient family, the rural-urban division, baby birthrate, and political consideration of winning votes effect the adoption of Bookstart program. For improving the effectiveness of the Bookstart program, several policy recommendations have been made for township librarians and the Bureau of Cultural Affairs respectively.",,,1,248,Public sector; Government; Political science; Policy studies; Market mechanism; Local government; National Policy; Public administration; Public relations; Service delivery framework; Entrepreneurship,,,,,https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?FirstID=U0020-2608201123062700,https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?FirstID=U0020-2608201123062700,,,2302314379,,0,,0,false,,

In our model, two lobby groups - representing industrial and environmental special interests - influence their government's policy decision. Their lobbying efforts not only depend on the domestic policy, but also on environmental regulation abroad. We find that both market structure and the characteristics of the pollutant are crucial determinants of the political equilibrium: given a local pollutant, the probability of convergence of environmental policies is increasing in the stringency of regulation abroad when product supply is relatively inelastic. This effect is reversed in the case of transboundary pollution.

To this end, I construct a theoretical framework by integrating principles from Legal Transplant, Policy Diffusion and Policy Transfer and Development Economics literatures, which allows for the examination of the adoption process from deliberation to formal adoption through to the implementation stage, in a single continuum. I also develop a typology of mechanisms through which laws may be transferred, particularly from developed to developing countries. In reviewing the adoption processes for competition laws in India and Pakistan, I examine and identify the transfer mechanisms and political and legal institutions, engaged by the two countries. I argue that the Indian competition law, that has been acquired through socialization and by engaging a wide range of bottom-up, participatory and inclusive institutions is more likely to be compatible with the context of the country and to have greater legitimacy in it, than the Pakistani competition law, which has been acquired through coercion and by engaging only a limited range of top-down and exclusive institutions. At the implementation stage I focus on the independent performance of the national competition authorities created by the competition laws and the interaction of these authorities with the courts pre-existing in the countries. This analysis confirms that the Indian competition law is more compatible with and enjoys greater legitimacy in India than its Pakistani counterpart does in Pakistan. However, it also indicates that no transfer mechanism is unequivocally superior to another and that in settling upon transfer mechanisms and institutions for adopting competition laws, it is important for countries to understand the trade-offs they may be making with respect to the implementation of these laws.",,,,,Political science; Law; Citizen journalism; Policy transfer; Competition law; Deliberation; Legal transplant; Legitimacy; Developing country; Politics,,,,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10043349/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.747350,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10043349/,,,2804345319,,0,,0,false,,
127-084-213-005-136,Precautionary Federalism and the Sharing Economy,,2017,journal article,Emory law journal,00944076,,,Sarah E. Light,"INTRODUCTIONThe rise of the ""sharing economy"" challenges many of our previous assumptions about the law.1 In areas as diverse as employment, insurance, privacy, and civil rights law, new firms like Uber and Lyft are rewriting traditional economic relationships both within and outside the firm.2 These new business models do not easily fit into legislative, regulatory, or doctrinal schemes designed with a different vision of the economy in mind.3 Scholars and policymakers are grappling with whether and how to govern these new firms.4 Some advocate a free market, contending that regulating Uber/Lyft will stymie innovation.5 Others favor regulation, contending that failure to regulate will place Uber/Lyft at a competitive advantage over existing firms.6 Still others ask what form such rules should take.7 But before determining whether and how to govern, we first ought to determine who should govern.In some instances, the answer to this question may be straightforward. Dual federalism theory distinguishes the types of problems that would be better served through uniform federal rules or state experimentation.8 Which of these two regulators is optimal may depend, for example, upon whether the problem will generate interstate spillovers or inspire states to ""race to the bottom"" by setting the most lax environmental standards to attract investment, jobs, and tax revenue. In contrast, advocates of dynamic federalism have argued that overlapping jurisdiction across different levels of government can facilitate experimentation and policy diffusion, promote good governance, and even serve the national interest.9 Recently, scholars of both ""localism"" and ""federalism"" have begun to recognize the independent interests and capacity of local governments in these debates.10 And some of the legal issues or impacts arising out of the sharing economy may interact with these debates in relatively straightforward ways. What is missing from this federalism scholarship, however, is a deep, express analysis of the role that uncertainty about potentially significant, even irreversible, impacts, such as the effect of innovative technologies and business models on climate change, should play in these analyses. This is not the traditional domain of federalism theory, but rather of the precautionary principle.11At its heart, the precautionary principle tells us that it is better to be safe than sorry in the face of significant risk of irreversible harm, even if we are uncertain about the magnitude of the risk.12 This Article's central claim is that what I call precautionary federalism offers a more complete answer than either dual or dynamic theories of federalism to the question of who should regulate under conditions of uncertainty. It also suggests an answer to a related question: for how long. Thus, precautionary federalism takes lessons from debates over the precautionary principle to a different context-the allocation of authority across different levels of government.Precautionary federalism has three primary features.13 First, it embodies a default presumption in favor of multiple regulatory voices and against broad exercises of preemption under conditions of uncertainty about potentially significant environmental, health, or safety impacts of innovative technologies or business models. This approach can promote information generation, interest group interaction in multiple fora, and tailoring of policy to local conditions. Second, precautionary federalism takes a ""wide viewscreen"" approach to risk-risk trade-offs.14 It recognizes that concerns regarding uncertainty about one type of risk must be weighed against other risks. The value of promoting policy experimentation under uncertainty must also be weighed against competing values-such as promoting innovation-that may support more uniform rules. And third, precautionary federalism is timebound. It acknowledges that greater certainty about impacts may warrant a shift from one allocation of authority to another, such as from regulatory overlap to greater consolidation. …",66,2,333,,Economics; Law and economics; Precautionary principle; Race to the bottom; Value (ethics); Dual federalism; Sharing economy; Business model; Federalism; Competitive advantage,,,,,https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/elj/vol66/iss2/3/ https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=elj,https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/elj/vol66/iss2/3/,,,3124448904,,0,,6,false,,

What are the international factors that explain the diffusion of this regulatory policy? Research on policy diffusion offers several explanations: constructivist, coercion, competition, and learning. Each of these theories is explored based on a dataset that tracks the implementation of number portability, fixed phone competition and mobile phone competition, and documentary evidence gathered from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), European Union, and the Inter-American Telecommunications Commission (CITEL). In these three regulatory issue areas, Asia, Americas, and Europe are the three regions that innovate first; Middle East and Africa follow later on. Further, Hong Kong and New Zealand in Asia and Canada, Chile, and the US in Americas are pioneers, while others wait to see results before proceeding; learning appears to explain the diffusion pattern in these regions. In contrast, in Europe, regulatory diffusion begins early and proceeds rapidly with pioneers like Finland and United Kingdom, but others adopt without the lag time observed in Asia and Americas, very likely because of the leadership and enforcement powers of the European Union, a coercive explanation among member states and a competitive one among non-member states.",,,,,International trade; Political science; Commission; Phone; Enforcement; Competition (economics); European union; Middle East; Single market; Documentary evidence,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2603753 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=2603753,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2603753,,,2992777123,,0,,0,false,,

Richard Gold,"Why do some countries adopt exogenous rules into their domestic law when those laws do not align with the country’s specific interests? This article draws on the policy diffusion literature to identify four causal mechanisms that are hypothesized to give rise to those transplants in the case of asymmetric interests. While the literature presents these mechanisms independently, this article argues that each works in combination with the others to facilitate legal transplantation. The empirical demonstration is based on a quantitative analysis of legal transplants in the field of intellectual property (IP), and incorporates an original index of IP protection in 121 developing countries over 14 years. Our results suggest that, while one mechanism – coercion – is instrumental in initiating the transplantation process, it fades over time and is largely supplanted by three others: contractualization, socialization and regulatory competition acting in a mutually supportive manner. This article concludes with a plea for theoretical eclecticism, acknowledging multi-causality and context-conditionality. Any comprehensive explanation of legal transplantation must include the identification of mutual reinforcement between causal mechanisms, rather than simply ranking their relative contributions.",,,,,Political science; Law and economics; Regulatory competition; Coercion; Plea; Socialization (Marxism); Transplantation; Intellectual property; Developing country; Municipal law,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ulb/ulbeco/2013-149496.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ulb/ulbeco/2013-149496.html,,,3148913954,,0,,0,false,,

Using an event history analysis, a traditional geographic model for policy diffusion is tested against a model where states learn from peer groups, defined by political culture. There is evidence for state learning within peer groups but less support for diffusion across state borders. Policy characteristics, environmental conditions, economic resources, and political constraints and opportunities are tested as drivers of differences in policy adoption. More than any other factor, politics and political culture explains the adoption of energy and climate-change policies. These results also suggest that restricted models that test geographical mechanisms of policy diffusion likely omit important characteristics that are correlated across states, leading to biased findings regarding the geographical state diffusion models in the extant literature.",23,5,795,817,Public economics; Policy analysis; Peer group; Energy policy; Economics; Policy studies; State (polity); Competition (economics); Political culture; Politics,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2014.923639 https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2014.923639,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2014.923639,,10.1080/09644016.2014.923639,1971620163,,0,000-869-073-485-477; 001-328-701-270-077; 001-871-757-369-265; 002-046-216-029-598; 005-692-270-875-15X; 007-076-434-060-031; 007-760-292-626-028; 013-126-282-071-945; 013-731-270-122-755; 014-280-690-513-425; 014-283-067-108-982; 014-694-012-786-985; 016-976-881-006-408; 017-811-442-996-383; 018-454-798-334-448; 020-180-195-011-961; 026-897-684-454-102; 027-835-981-532-333; 030-988-363-612-294; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-871-287-636-82X; 039-664-709-632-96X; 057-621-004-140-001; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-668-244-624-560; 058-903-156-385-886; 063-643-701-913-238; 065-461-042-638-353; 066-050-117-705-806; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-259-085-977-283; 073-166-408-788-371; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-959-398-708-786; 078-475-330-427-103; 078-521-648-921-392; 079-089-312-064-709; 079-705-757-170-703; 085-835-075-480-379; 098-241-276-361-679; 100-580-372-997-18X; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-208-298-196-530; 102-490-342-063-275; 107-180-510-677-777; 120-521-444-245-979; 127-807-528-981-832; 130-773-058-473-694; 135-210-605-672-143; 159-206-509-359-009; 183-338-697-640-934,87,false,,
128-571-509-560-539,Mobile Urbanism: Cities and Policymaking in the Global Age Edited by Eugene McCann and Kevin Ward,2012-01-30,2012,journal article,Berkeley Planning Journal,10475192,California Digital Library (CDL),United States,Sergio Montero,"In Mobile Urbanism, McCann and Ward have compiled a variety of high-quality articles by prominent scholars that examine urban policy circulations from a critical human geography perspective. In contrast to the burgeoning and more orthodox “policy diffusion” and “policy transfer” literature in political science and sociology, often based on assumptions of rational policy diffusion among nation-states, the authors of Mobile Urbanism build on the emerging interdisciplinary “policy mobility” approach that explores policy formation, transformation, and mobilization as a politicized, power-laden and socially constructed process that can happen at different government scales (Peck and Theodore 2010). Drawing from David Harvey’s (1989) fixity/mobility dichotomy and Doreen Massey’s (1991) idea of “global sense of place,” and looking specifically at urban policy mobilities, McCann and Ward advance an original theoretical framework to study cities in relational and territorial terms by focusing on how local policy is constituted by both connections to other places and local ‘political’ contestations. Their work contributes to a newly emerging scholarship in city planning which looks at the circulation of planning ideas, expertise, and knowledge (Healey and Upton 2010).",24,1,,,Sense of place; Sociology; Government; Urbanism; Policy transfer; Mobilities; Public administration; Social science; Urban planning; Human geography; Politics,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/18t0g1sd.pdf https://escholarship.org/uc/item/18t0g1sd https://escholarship.org/content/qt18t0g1sd/qt18t0g1sd.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5070/bp324111880,,10.5070/bp324111880,256319849,,0,013-804-365-658-717; 024-277-528-051-096; 028-448-864-083-723; 033-461-627-003-571; 068-185-057-555-105; 077-164-774-896-387; 082-647-134-377-906; 083-824-152-609-10X; 088-265-489-739-480; 091-125-118-048-107; 145-755-139-427-046; 160-222-345-546-187; 184-445-782-987-297; 197-253-114-478-935,2,true,,green
128-771-790-668-264,Is There a Role for Cost-Benefit Analysis Beyond the Nation-State?: Lessons from International Regulatory Co-Operation,2012-12-29,2012,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Alberto Alemanno,"In recent decades, governments across the world actively cooperated to harmonize and coordinate policies “behind the borders” through a variety of harmonization efforts at multilateral, as well as regional and bilateral, levels. These efforts have been dictated by the trade liberalization agenda, which perceives domestic regulatory action as a factor impeding international trade. While the WTO has been successful in removing barriers to trade at the border, it is proving less effective in the fight against non-tariff barriers (NTBs), today’s most prominent obstacles to trade exchanges. Given the current inability of the WTO to effectively address such concerns, some countries seem willing to go beyond traditional international treaty making and to explore new avenues of cooperation. The emerging phenomenon of “horizontal regulatory cooperation,” i.e., cooperation on crosscutting issues such as risk assessment, impact assessment, and cost-benefit analysis, seems to offer a promising venue for overcoming regulatory divergence. It relies on the assumption that substantive regulatory convergence can be facilitated by convergence of the general way in which regulators approach standard setting. At a time of growing international interest and policy diffusion of cost-benefit analysis, this chapter explores whether cost-benefit analysis could be used to promote rationality in regulatory decisionmaking beyond the nation-state. In so doing, it draws on the recent experience of international regulatory cooperation of some industrialized countries and examines the extent to which developing nations may be willing and able to participate in this cooperation exercise.",,,,,Impact assessment; International trade; Political science; Trade barrier; Rationality; Nation state; Convergence (economics); Harmonization; Risk management; Free trade,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2194299 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2194299 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2194299,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2194299,,,1880736916,,0,,1,false,,

The main contribution of this paper consists of introducing the possibility that local policymakers can be influenced by policy adopted by other local governments. The presence of a policy diffusion process, which explains part of the decision to privatize, is expected. Three new variables, not considered in previous studies, are introduced in order to test three hypotheses of policy diffusion. In doing so, data from 755 municipalities in Andalusia (southern Spain) for the period 1995–2013 are used. For data analysis a Logit Multilevel Model is applied.

Radaelli,"The paper examines public policy in the European Union (EU) by drawing upon the conceptual framework of policy transfer, which has been recently refined by comparativists, and the concept of isomorphism developed within organizational theory. Three case studies of EU policy transfer - namely monetary policy, tax policy, and media ownership policy - are discussed and compared for assessing the potential of isomorphism for the analysis of policy diffusion. The author argues that European institutions, which have a serious political limitation in terms of legitimacy, stimulate policy transfer by catalysing isomorphic processes which diffuse throughout the EU national policy solutions to collective problems. By contrast, policy transfer is severely constrained when there are no national cases to be imitated. In this circumstance, however, European institutions, most notably the European Commission, can overcome the problem by ‘inseminating’ solutions into national political systems.",,,,,Public policy; Policy analysis; Commercial policy; Political science; Foreign policy analysis; Policy studies; Policy transfer; European union; Education policy; Economic system,,,,,http://aei.pitt.edu/391/,http://aei.pitt.edu/391/,,,11658737,,0,,1,false,,

On the one hand, international financial institutions (IFIs) may have their own preferences for which types of programs to implement and which groups of the poor population to support. On the other hand, they may favor certain elements of the design, such as a targeting method or conditionalities because of interests which include not only short-term emergency aid but also long-term sustainable development and human capital accumulation.

This article contends that engagement, an alternative rhetorical strategy where advocates address the same policy dimensions as their opponents, is a more promising approach. Extending the engagement literature to the elite context in which most ACA-related decisions are made, it argues that elite-level engagement necessitates the additional task of linking policy change to opponents' broader philosophical and policy goals. Current debates surrounding the application of sales taxes to electronic commerce-a policy arena that seems far removed from health care policy but overlaps with the ACA in ways that make it an appropriate source of lesson drawing-illustrate the potential of an engagement strategy. Recently, many conservative lawmakers who previously opposed policy change have instead embraced online sales taxes as a mechanism for additional tax cuts. Analogous connections may facilitate the diffusion of ACA provisions that presently receive hostile receptions in Republican-leaning states.",42,2,341,362,Framing effect; Health care; Framing (social sciences); Political science; Rhetorical question; Elite; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Health care reform; Public relations; Assertion,health care reform; policy diffusion; rhetorical strategies,"Health Policy; Humans; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Political Activism; Politics; Social Control, Formal; United States",,,https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article/42/2/341/13879/Framing-Engagement-and-Policy-Change-Lessons-for https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28007797/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28007797 https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/framing-engagement-and-policy-change-lessons-for-the-aca,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/03616878-3766746,28007797,10.1215/03616878-3766746,2562226503,,0,001-702-165-034-296; 007-397-097-882-284; 008-185-182-356-109; 010-675-136-948-967; 015-030-167-926-65X; 018-507-965-164-922; 020-506-111-298-641; 026-555-507-636-650; 029-350-090-905-391; 029-507-881-519-246; 030-097-046-778-291; 033-380-094-368-193; 039-735-495-740-660; 041-154-431-461-562; 043-064-012-271-872; 051-908-645-824-972; 051-963-094-079-17X; 055-498-815-134-39X; 060-034-388-946-005; 066-204-173-550-035; 067-020-613-560-975; 069-378-491-782-084; 070-224-093-134-624; 077-495-223-631-426; 087-401-099-506-371; 087-824-275-535-935; 092-360-678-636-499; 157-968-607-593-999; 166-584-633-331-54X; 169-033-697-854-858; 170-317-063-640-700; 181-456-411-931-264; 193-579-318-151-867; 193-702-165-940-320,3,true,,bronze

As such, this paper provides an overview of existing datasets on social security and discusses their strengths and shortcomings. The projects presented are appropriate for empirical analyses, including both event history analyses and multivariate regressions. As much of the research on social security systems thus far has mainly focused on OECD countries, this paper takes a closer look on data of the Non-OECD world, which can be used to supplement existing data projects and for the analysis of global social security dynamics.",,,,,Regional science; Political science; Social policy; Social security; Event history; Oecd countries; Public administration,,,,,http://edoc.vifapol.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5762/pdf/ZeS_AP_2014_03.pdf http://edoc.vifapol.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5762/ https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:zeswps:032014 https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/zeswps/032014.html,http://edoc.vifapol.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5762/,,,1955239600,,0,017-240-257-801-39X; 020-960-893-392-56X; 028-256-744-113-514; 035-261-961-935-32X; 084-627-769-231-921; 114-297-985-479-03X; 132-716-802-925-815; 198-496-265-529-229,2,false,,
130-395-121-942-620,Regressive Taxation and the Welfare State: Path Dependence and Policy Diffusion,2003-09-01,2003,book,,,,,Junko Kato,"Government size has attracted much scholarly attention. Political economists have considered large public expenditures a product of leftist rule and an expression of a stronger representation of labour interest. Although the size of the government has become the most important policy difference between the left and right in post-war politics, the formation of the government's funding base is also important. Junko Kato finds that the differentiation of tax revenue structure is path dependent upon the shift to regressive taxation. Since the 1980s, the institutionalisation of effective revenue raising by regressive taxes during periods of high growth has ensured resistance to welfare state backlash during budget deficits and consolidated the diversification of state funding capacity among industrial democracies. This book challenges the conventional wisdom that progressive taxation goes hand-in-hand with large public expenditures in mature welfare states and qualifies the partisan centred explanation that dominates the welfare state literature.",,,,,Public economics;

Contrary to the usual setting with simultaneous decision-making, we consider the impact of sequential decision-making: In the first step, the domestic government introduces an emission tax; in the second step, policy diffusion occurs with a certain probability; and in the third step, the firms decide on output quantities. Within this framework, we analyze how the prospect of policy diffusion, motivated by a higher damage parameter in the domestic country, influences the optimal domestic emission tax. We show that if the damage parameter in the foreign country is sufficiently high, policy diffusion will occur which leads to higher tax rates and higher welfare compared to the equilibrium resulting from simultaneous decision-making. Moreover, we show that an increase in the domestic tax rate also increases the probability that the foreign country adopts the tax policy.",15,3,259,270,Public economics; Welfare; Diffusion (business); Government; Economics; Microeconomics; Social policy; Tax policy; Tax rate; Double taxation; Tax reform,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:envpol:v:15:y:2013:i:3:p:259-270 https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/92959/1/750742038.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-013-0055-9 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10018-013-0055-9.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-013-0055-9/fulltext.html https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/92959 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/envpol/v15y2013i3p259-270.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10018-013-0055-9,,10.1007/s10018-013-0055-9,2051029451,,0,000-734-680-446-981; 005-249-461-623-469; 008-765-406-103-495; 009-146-459-473-792; 020-148-048-477-956; 021-907-061-236-840; 022-621-656-070-387; 025-102-980-469-095; 025-336-617-303-834; 030-503-597-166-313; 093-205-450-246-773; 108-166-013-954-847; 132-861-720-144-821; 145-610-203-550-114; 155-693-224-209-483; 163-637-734-144-951,1,true,,green

The potential policy “lender” is China whereas the potential policy “borrower” is Ethiopia. The object of policy transfer is Transit Oriented Development (TOD). A new, world-class metro system has been partly built in Hangzhou, which presents an opportunity to study TOD development in a Chinese context. In Addis Ababa, the first light-rail transit system in sub-Saharan Africa was built in 2015 through capital funding from China and is being operated by Chinese companies. Despite this connection, the study reveals little evidence that any direct policy transfer has occurred between the two countries. More than policy transfer, this is a case of global policy diffusion, which is facilitated by new communication media and the globalization of planning practice.",,,404,420,Business; China; Globalization; Global South; Policy transfer; Transit-oriented development; Context (language use); Sub saharan; Economic growth; Capital (economics),,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:dcc27cb https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786439239/9781786439239.00033.xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.4337/9781786439246.00033,,10.4337/9781786439246.00033,3013185659,,0,,0,false,,

Using a directed state-dyad dependent variable and a piecewise linear growth model to capture states’ policy differences and changes, this dissertation investigates the impact of Race to the Top on state-level education policy diffusion in teacher policy, college and career readiness policy, and persistently lowest achieving schools policy during the first two rounds of the competition, spanning March 2009 to August 2010. ; The analysis suggests that states were most reactive to federal preferences in the teacher policy area; after the release of federal program guidance and the announcement of Round 1 winners, state policies converged and moved towards the policies of the Round 1 winners, adopting policies to tie teacher evaluations to students’ academic growth, compensate based on performance, and incentivize teaching in high-need schools, among others. The effects of federal preferences were not as distinct in college and career readiness policy, in which state policies were generally converging during this time frame, or in persistently lowest achieving schools policy where other grant programs may have mediated the influence of RTTT. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence to suggest future use of competitive grant programs as a means for the federal government to influence state education policy. ; This study adds to education policy research through the use of diffusion theory to understand the effects of federal competitive grants, rather than another policy tool, on state policy reforms. Further, this research contributes to policy and diffusion literature by demonstrating the value of piecewise linear growth models to simultaneously model the spread of policies across states and the influence of federal preferences on state policy decisions over time.",,,,,Public policy; Policy analysis; Government; Political science; Policy studies; State (polity); Competition (economics); Race to the Top; Public administration; Education policy,,,,,http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/19694/,http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/19694/,,,2233506175,,0,,1,false,,

Rom-Jensen,"This article studies the Kennedy administration’s labor market policies as a case of lesson drawing during a transnational moment in the early 1960s. With the election of Kennedy, leaders in the labor movement rose to positions of policymaking influence, in the process reimagining the United States’ political and economic landscape. This spirit of reform led to the embrace of Sweden’s solidarity wage policy and Rehn-Meidner model as lessons on how to balance full employment, economic growth, and a powerful labor movement. However, Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg and Walter Reuther of the United Automobile Workers found implementing Swedish policies to be more difficult than they expected, even with the support of a sitting president.

Education policies and programmes such as child-centred pedagogies, school-based management, teachers’ accountability, publicprivate partnerships or conditional-cash transfer schemes are being discussed and implemented everywhere, to the point that they have acquired the status of ‘global education polices’ (GEP). More and more researchers, coming from different disciplines and sub-disciplines such as comparative education, political sociology, anthropology and political sciences, are paying attention to the GEP phenomenon. Traditionally, scholars have used very diverse terms to refer to this phenomenon, such as policy diffusion, policy borrowing, policy transfer, policy travelling, isomorphism or convergence, among others.",,,3,32,Comparative education; Political science; Political sociology; Accountability; Global education; Policy transfer; Public administration; Isomorphism (sociology); Education policy; International development,,,,,https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/1540913/133115_verger_intro.pdf https://educationanddevelopment.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/verger-et-al-gep_introduction.pdf https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2Fab798695-7be7-4480-856b-1269b3426ffb https://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/geps/sites/grupsderecerca.uab.cat.geps/files/Verger%20et%20al%20GEP_introduction.pdf http://www.anthrocervone.org/development/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Globalization.pdf https://dare.uva.nl/personal/search?identifier=ab798695-7be7-4480-856b-1269b3426ffb,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2Fab798695-7be7-4480-856b-1269b3426ffb,,,2429841057,,0,001-025-617-079-546; 002-310-467-414-626; 003-544-056-320-324; 009-767-496-026-782; 012-394-471-971-461; 012-467-150-825-142; 012-679-441-577-059; 013-255-114-765-527; 013-946-799-380-330; 014-493-176-109-971; 014-596-155-054-23X; 014-706-892-990-428; 015-083-984-227-735; 015-620-081-204-496; 016-634-666-282-338; 016-857-978-568-376; 017-010-933-750-388; 017-124-424-324-140; 018-474-622-463-586; 019-175-648-768-552; 019-566-797-554-759; 021-889-737-476-099; 022-496-616-914-581; 022-810-439-077-235; 022-988-814-109-576; 024-195-858-822-595; 024-678-437-261-976; 024-968-092-817-857; 025-426-016-408-584; 026-130-963-232-293; 026-550-711-985-935; 027-578-192-452-811; 027-752-680-257-725; 033-906-738-563-431; 035-020-828-140-985; 037-559-005-693-927; 039-287-076-924-40X; 044-487-351-548-128; 044-763-517-980-825; 044-784-533-981-329; 046-580-674-624-69X; 047-084-059-682-373; 047-434-767-203-254; 047-768-863-315-045; 048-846-133-812-979; 050-055-325-190-511; 050-271-125-351-591; 057-258-883-326-852; 057-389-110-368-33X; 058-306-828-354-340; 060-919-417-640-987; 061-495-518-352-511; 066-385-832-479-662; 069-415-884-519-762; 071-846-033-952-37X; 072-339-601-206-122; 074-530-999-787-120; 074-599-362-576-399; 078-127-492-971-813; 078-402-560-969-074; 081-418-503-496-594; 082-890-221-444-767; 084-001-465-924-433; 084-001-616-087-653; 091-580-423-833-069; 095-117-870-844-57X; 095-458-514-998-869; 096-206-523-908-533; 102-473-180-042-185; 104-669-589-143-86X; 106-163-846-416-027; 106-210-771-875-50X; 107-963-131-771-924; 112-135-738-336-328; 117-384-555-281-765; 120-124-062-143-337; 123-961-033-320-143; 126-693-664-052-166; 131-314-817-277-330; 131-399-480-028-384; 134-155-237-343-147; 148-182-885-312-658; 148-418-818-509-010; 148-460-439-813-652; 149-411-650-637-135; 155-344-943-804-961; 160-171-626-698-85X; 168-959-236-217-154; 175-316-285-971-385; 177-091-501-410-813; 179-136-743-965-677; 190-330-214-459-629,45,false,,

This paper tests four mechanisms of policy diffusion - learning, economic competition, imitation, and coercion - at the municipal level that address these two conflicting viewpoints. Using currently relevant immigration sanctuary policies that have been enacted by cities nationwide, this paper attempts to isolate the individual mechanisms by which policies diffuse from city to city. In addition to testing specific mechanisms of diffusion at the municipal level and addressing a pressing policy issue, this manuscript is also methodologically innovative, taking advantage of binary times-series, cross-sectional (BTSCS) models instead of the standard event history analysis (EHA). These models can account for multiple failures in ways most previous studies have not. All together, this paper will hopefully expand our understanding of diffusion mechanisms and policymaking in a federal system, shed light on an important issue of public policy, and expand the use of innovative methodologies in the discipline.",,,,,Public economics; Public policy; Imitation; Political science; Viewpoints; Coercion; Municipal level; Development economics; Federalism; Democracy; Immigration,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1767242,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1767242,,,2254277603,,0,,0,false,,

This paper examines the presumptions that surround the spread of good policies, considers the motivations of actors at a lower tier when they are pressured to adopt policies, and draws on case studies from Europe to discuss the potential for a range of approaches to stimulate the uptake of good policies.

133-087-716-464-773,Learning from foreign models in Latin American policy reform,,2004,book,,,,,Kurt Weyland,"The international diffusion of policy ideas and practices is a subject of growing interest, raising such questions as: Why are there increasingly such waves of policy innovation? What prompts one country to emulate another's changes? Is it the influence of powerful international actors like the World Bank? Is it the motivations and interests of domestic actors? And how freely do imitators adapt foreign models to the needs and characteristics of their own countries, rather than simply replicating them? Essays by leading academic experts and by policy practitioners with academic background address these important questions in Learning from Foreign Models in Latin American Policy Reform. Two chapters examine the influence of the international financial institutions. Then experts from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico discuss how foreign models influenced their own decision making in crucial areas of social policy such as pensions, unemployment insurance, and health care. These case studies yield an unprecedented insider perspective on policy diffusion, in particular showing that the financial institutions have less clout than sometimes appears. They also show the crucial role played by policy specialists inside the public bureaucracy. Contributors: David Bravo, Sarah M.

Djupe; Laura R. Olson,"Most American congregations belong to denominations. These national networks often promote relevant political issues that constituent congregations may choose to address. Therefore, religious organizations might play a significant role in promoting the process of policy diffusion in the U.S. states. At the same time, congregations are tradition-maintaining institutions that focus first on their own immediate concerns, promoting the maintenance of distinctive regional political contexts and reinforcing the variation of federalism. In this article, we assess the role that religious organizations play in American federal democracy, promoting diffusion or the status quo, with respect to one crucial issue on which religious groups have been particularly vocal: the environment and global warming. We employ two datasets (a large-N national survey and two in-depth survey case studies of clergy in Ohio and South Carolina) and find evidence that religious organizations are vast communication networks that can promo...",10,3,270,301,Political science; Status quo; Religious organization; South carolina; Public administration; Public relations; Federalism; Democracy; Politics,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/diffusion-of-environmental-concerns-in-congregations-across-us-states/78B3B9B08E46C59D973F2D52FEF64648 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/153244001001000304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/153244001001000304,,10.1177/153244001001000304,2328930828,,0,000-340-145-757-567; 001-370-336-792-051; 002-624-673-312-93X; 004-146-046-789-818; 005-192-645-017-24X; 005-505-877-808-934; 008-014-204-779-30X; 008-809-979-742-501; 010-205-372-003-280; 011-630-383-966-000; 011-712-761-845-580; 011-813-141-957-218; 013-595-196-965-725; 015-271-723-324-164; 018-454-798-334-448; 022-621-892-426-584; 025-886-626-894-775; 026-441-178-882-651; 026-469-830-725-732; 030-057-453-876-36X; 031-785-351-890-787; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-812-494-450-07X; 035-036-900-250-043; 035-726-649-472-41X; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-174-317-596-23X; 037-957-164-890-884; 039-837-167-119-207; 042-266-860-198-531; 050-030-659-887-705; 050-082-471-457-812; 051-637-188-854-073; 057-090-537-484-157; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-192-154-741-789; 059-967-032-585-64X; 065-464-957-757-100; 066-037-368-432-586; 067-294-132-356-613; 067-490-686-317-462; 071-397-493-373-642; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-615-448-797-387; 077-292-312-519-129; 078-249-789-490-901; 079-062-566-937-960; 079-443-267-775-69X; 080-270-912-863-370; 081-297-890-926-858; 084-787-681-556-687; 087-616-118-370-712; 092-079-195-772-694; 094-359-683-461-587; 096-517-829-236-651; 096-598-033-350-819; 099-271-431-786-225; 100-358-425-889-83X; 100-580-372-997-18X; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-061-420-452-490; 102-797-199-716-865; 104-955-417-848-254; 108-697-858-731-111; 113-474-852-575-931; 114-318-273-945-530; 123-004-422-319-969; 126-426-336-365-490; 126-676-612-047-889; 128-029-395-005-333; 129-053-243-507-250; 129-531-463-365-067; 132-397-404-532-586; 134-622-654-830-982; 139-193-747-797-092; 143-126-101-011-518; 143-140-580-581-411; 151-230-898-526-104; 155-228-346-814-231; 155-580-858-393-517; 156-639-153-265-11X; 160-346-451-453-51X; 173-086-189-894-830; 179-548-617-331-471; 181-339-246-151-869; 185-327-956-961-556; 187-397-656-450-670; 190-304-076-718-223,16,false,,

Wantz,"This project is an examination of patterns of state policy adoption, and provides a new theory for policy diffusion research.   While traditional policy diffusion research focuses on geographic proximity as the main mechanism for policy adoption, I argue that states are more likely to rely on partisan proximity and adopt policy from partisan neighbors.  This is, primarily, a result of heightened polarization nationally.  In the absence of national policymaking, states will feel both more pressure to create more policy as well as leeway to enact more partisan policies. In order to test this theory, I look at three cases: same-sex marriage, right-to-work, and state lottery adoption.  I utilize interviews with state lawmakers and interest group staff as well as quantitative methods to show the relationship between partisanship and policy diffusion.  Overall, this work adds an important element to a vast and well-established literature and provides a new way of understanding the policy creation in the American states",,,,,Public economics; Diffusion (business); Political economy; Economics; State policy,,,,,https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/15721,http://dx.doi.org/10.13016/m2jc72,,10.13016/m2jc72,403920753,,0,,0,false,,

Dougherty; Rebecca S. Natow; Sosanya M. Jones; Hana Lahr; Lara Elaine Pheatt; Vikash T. Reddy,"Although performance funding for higher education has existed for many years, the details of particular performance funding programs have changed—sometimes dramatically—over time. A new form of performance funding often called performance funding 2.0 (PF 2.0) represents a major shift in performance funding and in higher education funding more generally. Unlike earlier forms of performance funding that took the form of a bonus on top of the base state funding for higher education, PF 2.0 is embedded into the base funding itself. PF 2.0 programs are seen as promising means to significantly improve institutional performance due to the fact that they typically tie a larger portion of state funding to performance indicators than do PF 1.0 programs. Additionally, PF 2.0 programs aim to be more stable than PF 1.0 programs, as PF 2.0 performance indicators are written into the regular state funding formula itself and are not separate programs that can be easily dropped. Despite the importance of this new development, little is known about the forces that are giving rise to PF 2.0 programs. This paper examines the political forces supporting the enactment of PF 2.0 in three leading states (Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee) and compares these forces with those involved in the enactment of PF 1.0 performance funding programs. To understand this political process, we apply three theoretical perspectives within policy theory: the Advocacy Coalition Framework, Policy Entrepreneurship theory, and policy diffusion theory. These three perspectives powerfully illuminate different facets of the origins of PF 2.0 policies when treated as complementary rather than as mutually exclusive explanations.",,,,,Higher education; Performance indicator; Political science; State (polity); Diffusion theory; Political process; Public administration; Mutually exclusive events; Entrepreneurship; Politics,,,,,http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/political-origins-performance-funding-2.html https://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/political-origins-performance-funding-2.html https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8NS0RWM https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8K07CVQ/download https://67.205.94.182/publications/political-origins-performance-funding-2.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/d8ns0rwm,,10.7916/d8ns0rwm,1578318968,,0,013-126-282-071-945; 016-171-927-321-318; 017-166-530-871-856; 027-827-119-143-849; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-474-489-397-242; 047-558-081-081-541; 047-732-152-555-814; 055-267-246-442-334; 062-222-159-195-376; 066-951-129-463-419; 068-905-690-168-04X; 070-022-080-897-926; 072-756-289-340-139; 077-292-312-519-129; 091-119-587-279-935; 096-548-920-809-272; 097-416-968-699-086; 098-486-991-467-021; 105-661-707-828-65X; 105-931-564-594-872; 116-582-202-369-789; 124-833-407-068-254; 131-765-468-372-999; 146-921-126-094-067; 148-460-439-813-652; 152-255-523-905-607; 165-714-890-716-957; 174-136-060-342-997,3,false,,

Spatializing the Dynamics of Policy Diffusion,2017-09-14,2017,journal article,Policy Studies Journal,0190292x; 15410072,Wiley,United Kingdom,Joshua L. Mitchell,"For decades, scholars in multiple disciplines have examined spatial diffusion, or the spatiotemporal properties associated with the diffusion of innovations. These properties include contagious, hierarchical, and relocation diffusion. Each of these refers to a spatial model that epitomizes how innovations spread among geographic locations. Policy diffusion, a separate but homologous research tradition, had its theoretical underpinnings in spatial diffusion. However, contemporary policy diffusion has focused largely on mechanism-based diffusion. This article demonstrates how exploratory spatial data analysis can be used to uncover spatial policy diffusion properties. In this study, municipal smoking regulation adoptions, religious-based initiatives, and bag ban and bag fees are examined. This study finds evidence that for each policy more than one property is occurring; therefore, this study proposes that a hybrid model best explains diffusion. This article demonstrates how examining spatial diffusion properties, in addition to diffusion mechanisms, can improve the conceptualization of diffusion theories, enhance mechanism or theory-based specification of diffusion models, and unravel the specific regional or neighboring causal pathways linking policies between adopting jurisdictions.",46,2,424,451,Public economics; Diffusion (business); Dynamics (music); Spatial analysis; Economics; Property (philosophy); Economic geography; Space (commercial competition); Mechanism (sociology); Diffusion of innovations; Conceptualization,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psj.12226,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/psj.12226,,10.1111/psj.12226,2755574617,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 001-367-136-082-787; 002-557-636-257-591; 005-692-270-875-15X; 010-278-292-671-040; 015-348-206-961-272; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-965-014-643-07X; 023-672-511-213-267; 026-673-215-386-052; 031-248-920-440-257; 033-085-475-899-252; 033-969-989-312-301; 036-041-109-144-954; 036-961-749-635-681; 042-054-997-661-174; 044-315-497-930-601; 044-958-408-877-837; 047-969-528-563-464; 048-221-626-453-871; 050-082-471-457-812; 052-170-576-189-984; 055-456-868-588-445; 057-621-004-140-001; 057-669-245-403-397; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-274-660-526-403; 063-446-677-896-059; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-562-251-636-006; 073-014-201-416-869; 073-166-408-788-371; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 079-416-691-248-326; 079-431-541-601-150; 080-565-739-524-874; 084-154-879-306-982; 086-379-564-939-11X; 096-517-829-236-651; 098-317-151-036-205; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-224-552-394-621; 101-460-831-219-265; 101-488-954-100-242; 106-352-974-752-749; 110-308-455-303-841; 114-469-305-545-899; 115-507-066-329-320; 117-677-347-760-402; 122-586-909-529-550; 134-300-624-191-268; 139-153-398-330-745; 149-479-005-872-184; 149-601-821-920-013; 173-256-407-940-663,21,false,,

Condrey,"This article examines the Georgia lottery as a “policy laboratory” and its potential effect on state-level policy diffusion. The authors summarize an extensive research project they directed that included a survey of every state that offers a lottery, a general population survey of Georgia citizen attitudes toward the lottery, and results from an economic model summarizing the economic effects of the lottery. The analysis reveals that the Georgia lottery has been a significant source of revenue for the state's budget and operates in an administratively cost-effective manner. The analysis also confirms the conventional wisdom that lower-income households spend a greater proportionate share of their income on the lottery and that African Americans are more frequent players than whites. Furthermore, the Georgia lottery enjoys broad public support, the key to which appears to be the earmarking of lottery funds to specific, new, popular education programs. However, the data reveal that those educational programs promulgated by the Georgia lottery benefit citizens from both high and low socioeconomic status. Finally, the article suggests that lottery-generated funds may reach a plateau or peak during the first decade of implementation and that state policymakers should design lottery-funded programs accordingly.",20,4,691,712,Public economics; Economic model; Socioeconomic status; Economics; Revenue; State (polity); Lottery; Popular education; Conventional wisdom; Economic growth; Politics,,,,,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1541-1338.2003.00047.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1541-1338.2003.00047.x,,10.1046/j.1541-1338.2003.00047.x,2051172564,,0,018-115-228-224-267; 019-022-884-643-738; 020-180-195-011-961; 026-680-137-756-69X; 036-961-749-635-681; 061-952-871-951-065; 067-490-686-317-462; 070-149-039-252-577; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-803-554-182-51X; 081-733-687-368-393; 090-278-973-018-508; 090-528-741-776-376; 101-011-229-347-877; 101-212-023-362-781; 133-526-578-286-412,16,false,,

MacKenzie; Markus Ohndorf,"In this article, we examine the regulation of pollution in open economies when the regulator is influenced by special interest groups. In a setting with free trade, we identify conditions under which a country may unilaterally adopt the stricter regulatory standards of its competitors. In our model, two lobby groups - representing industrial and environmental special interests - influence their government's policy decision. Their lobbying efforts not only depend on the domestic policy, but also on environmental regulation abroad. We find that both market structure and the characteristics of the pollutant are crucial determinants of the political equilibrium: given a local pollutant, the probability of convergence of environmental policies is increasing in the stringency of regulation abroad when product supply is relatively inelastic. This effect is reversed in the case of transboundary pollution. We also extend our framework to cases of imperfect competition.",,,,,Special Interest Group; Competitor analysis; Product (category theory); Business; Government; Market structure; International economics; Imperfect competition; Domestic policy; Free trade,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/vfsc15/113132.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/vfsc15/113132.html,,,3123097791,,0,,0,false,,

Kelley; Paulette Lloyd,"Coercion is pervasive in international politics. From military invasion to the subtle raising of a diplomatic eyebrow, from occupation to conditional aid, international relations is all about how states attempt to influence one another‘s policies in ways they believe will contribute to their security and welfare. As nations have become increasingly interdependent, the range of issues on which they have attempted to exert influence has expanded. Historically, international relations were focused primarily on state security through the use of military force. The integration of markets and the interconnectedness of societies on many new dimensions have created new reasons for states to try to influence the conditions in and policies of their neighbors. Indeed, coercion is broadly cited as one of the major mechanisms for policy diffusion globally in the last few decades (Simmons, Dobbin, and Garrett 2008). ; Transnational crime is but one example of this trend. Economic liberalization has increased the possibilities for agents to prosper from transnational activities that run counter to those banned in other jurisdictions. Lower transaction costs have fostered trade and immigration the world over, but these conditions have also fueled transnational black markets for narcotics, weapons, and even for human beings. Increasingly, governments have strong incentives to press for a coordinated approach, lest such activities spill across borders unabated. ; The United States has played the key role in defining, coordinating and strengthening criminal law world-wide. We have seen this leadership in a number of areas, most spectacularly in the ―war on drugs‖ prosecuted internationally over the course of the last three decades. More recently, the United States has taken a hard line that human trafficking should be criminalized in both domestic and international law, and has devoted significant resources to encouraging other countries to do the same. No other country has more assiduously tried to document, publicize and influence countries‘ policy efforts than has the United States. This paper asks: How and to what extent have US efforts to shape other countries‘ human trafficking been effective? ; The US policy on human trafficking is particularly interesting because it is aimed at countries worldwide. It mixes different diplomatic strategies such as sanction threats and shaming. Some countries appear to be special targets, while others face no US pressure to speak of. The different treatment and the variation in responses provide an opportunity to examine questions of the relative efficacy of a range of strategies to pressure governments to adopt reform. This research can inform both theoretical and practical debates about how, and why and to what extent coercion works. Do governments respond more to concrete changes in their incentive structure or to threats to their reputation brought about by official shaming, in this case by the US government?",,,,,Political economy; Political science; Criminal law; Coercion; Sanctions; Incentive; International relations; Economic liberalization; International law; Immigration,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2138265_code391287.pdf?abstractid=2108732&mirid=1,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2138265_code391287.pdf?abstractid=2108732&mirid=1,,,3139095177,,0,,0,false,,

Mitchell; Brendan Toner,"In recent years, measures have been taken to ban the use of international legal principles in state courts. While these international laws vary in terms of the specific restrictions they place on state legal practices, many of these laws have been aimed implicitly or explicitly at banning Sharia law practices. While dozens of states have attempted to pass anti-Sharia policies, thus far, only eight have been successful. In this article, we apply a policy diffusion framework to help explain the agenda placement and adoption of these measures. We find that both internal state determinants and external regional diffusion factors influence the interstate agenda placement and adoption of anti-Sharia practices. However, the regional effect is negative, meaning that these policies follow an atypical diffusion pattern.

Under this concept, we explore one of the most striking cases of institutional diffusion in Latin America: the process of transformation of Latin American universities linked to the reform movement that shook the University of Cordoba, in Argentina, during 1918. The principles of this reform inspired important institutional changes and continue to be central on the discussions about tertiary education in the region. Most of its precepts (political autonomy, student co-government, extension and social commitment) live today and are defended as fundamental pillars of the Latin American university. Thus, the main question that this article asks is: what is the contribution that the expansion of the university reform movement can make to diffusion theory? Our answer is that studying the diffusion of the Cordoba Reform allows to more deeply understand two very important dimensions in the circulation of ideas. First, the evidence allows us to delve into the role of the domestic context. The context is usually pointed out as a restriction on the diffusion process (it explains the distance between the original and the copy). However, in this case the ideational context favored the adoption of the reform. Second, historical reconstruction helps to understand more fully the role of entrepreneurs, in general, and that of a specific type of actors: activist networks, in this case, the student movement.",47,2,e37375,,Public policy; Higher education; Political economy; Latin Americans; Political science; Extension (metaphysics); Reform movement; Context (language use); Autonomy; Politics,,,,,https://revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br/index.php/iberoamericana/article/view/37375,http://dx.doi.org/10.15448/1980-864x.2021.2.37375,,10.15448/1980-864x.2021.2.37375,3197023976,,0,000-995-247-413-877; 007-756-813-507-939; 008-414-059-072-131; 012-467-150-825-142; 016-329-200-891-376; 020-417-628-746-043; 020-460-151-513-229; 022-762-388-498-190; 028-933-497-480-442; 030-044-409-895-333; 030-251-628-058-895; 038-136-655-947-548; 038-420-007-444-916; 038-790-977-968-874; 039-318-000-420-191; 044-551-225-580-278; 045-860-985-304-298; 046-871-834-972-803; 046-909-845-899-681; 049-219-615-824-319; 050-274-654-059-514; 051-563-283-713-00X; 051-856-408-196-595; 055-078-193-772-731; 067-133-212-261-705; 067-958-957-394-47X; 071-002-761-174-297; 074-581-006-544-862; 075-428-805-584-444; 077-495-223-631-426; 087-476-692-675-041; 093-190-746-631-057; 107-956-379-561-925; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-295-565-102-383; 118-513-543-976-791; 128-230-824-210-349; 138-211-296-403-276; 148-806-117-402-485; 151-162-840-307-804; 164-013-942-811-246; 165-596-578-665-003; 165-635-784-196-77X; 171-442-623-487-097,0,true,cc-by,gold

This research develops the argument that parties are more likely to employ the heuristic of learning from and emulating foreign successful (incumbent) parties. Spatial-econometric analyses of parties’ election policies from several established democracies robustly confirm that political parties respond to left-right policy positions of foreign political parties that have recently governed. By showing that parties respond to these foreign incumbent parties, this work has significant implications for our understanding of party competition. Furthermore, we contribute to the literature on public policy diffusion, as we suggest that political parties are important vehicles through which public policies diffuse.",110,2,397,410,Public policy; Political economy; Multi-party system; Economics; Party competition; Public administration; Argument; Primary election; Politics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/apsrev/v110y2016i02p397-410_00.html https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/party-policy-diffusion/83F629A7DC64439805A4C1084BCC7BFB https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:cup:apsrev:v:110:y:2016:i:02:p:397-410_00 https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/58642/ http://repository.essex.ac.uk/17301/ https://core.ac.uk/download/74374493.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0003055416000162,,10.1017/s0003055416000162,2470234668,,0,000-273-530-033-103; 000-915-216-403-358; 002-090-110-364-521; 002-577-980-557-663; 003-025-422-339-881; 003-120-389-421-319; 004-336-147-101-733; 004-571-652-977-461; 004-788-411-104-755; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-439-868-038-998; 005-553-153-856-945; 006-722-686-316-360; 007-500-771-048-201; 008-463-673-681-771; 010-003-191-094-552; 010-649-755-409-613; 010-947-899-562-815; 011-088-825-646-470; 013-721-955-273-688; 014-420-171-880-92X; 014-948-334-023-398; 015-312-925-365-683; 015-462-010-609-92X; 015-753-547-305-299; 016-194-428-164-946; 016-836-154-232-236; 018-599-489-876-11X; 019-163-168-230-27X; 019-955-863-993-733; 021-639-580-776-197; 025-193-488-999-63X; 026-308-629-321-341; 026-412-549-797-331; 026-643-358-887-869; 026-775-594-060-761; 027-152-711-597-919; 028-597-737-481-330; 032-925-886-572-222; 033-085-475-899-252; 034-277-783-905-290; 035-061-927-263-746; 035-261-961-935-32X; 036-316-736-908-394; 037-235-578-908-488; 039-412-520-002-824; 039-638-566-976-263; 041-092-948-304-622; 041-659-281-349-623; 043-027-207-713-420; 046-812-757-956-825; 048-384-936-724-987; 052-957-372-948-888; 053-406-954-147-680; 055-028-821-073-582; 055-532-729-324-361; 056-672-370-150-588; 058-418-465-913-030; 058-478-058-643-605; 059-038-212-321-039; 059-053-383-988-642; 059-556-209-807-767; 061-119-463-691-911; 061-162-133-058-674; 061-373-791-267-531; 061-973-970-085-871; 062-503-756-420-042; 062-613-015-440-350; 062-877-575-225-439; 063-107-655-348-581; 064-671-173-784-907; 065-666-299-776-558; 066-147-575-518-38X; 068-011-213-219-585; 069-208-127-389-559; 069-727-881-724-448; 070-992-501-063-733; 072-090-829-344-184; 072-862-908-678-93X; 073-030-626-169-04X; 073-693-004-437-30X; 074-465-905-471-400; 075-089-695-295-014; 077-945-151-328-246; 080-378-424-661-571; 082-017-566-839-450; 083-128-427-871-272; 083-620-105-108-236; 083-835-412-631-56X; 085-980-180-128-634; 086-163-694-850-604; 092-810-759-587-647; 094-585-621-391-03X; 099-632-707-150-545; 100-254-044-576-841; 105-521-696-637-174; 111-649-892-201-407; 111-727-111-304-042; 112-274-167-953-508; 112-333-966-495-520; 112-528-955-514-968; 115-292-903-924-077; 115-716-554-714-093; 117-677-347-760-402; 119-920-962-885-899; 121-656-974-147-713; 122-321-798-500-697; 124-543-671-647-444; 125-139-828-437-413; 127-220-108-018-000; 127-845-223-634-28X; 129-543-580-966-505; 129-827-239-773-157; 130-715-233-590-308; 135-004-167-779-866; 135-321-067-197-657; 137-686-007-198-732; 138-524-873-922-154; 142-237-274-537-919; 142-472-386-597-641; 144-284-926-428-828; 144-877-325-501-034; 145-975-486-752-358; 147-940-753-450-411; 148-223-435-969-407; 151-069-248-817-278; 153-904-167-184-367; 155-241-032-190-362; 157-471-694-925-950; 158-511-642-542-78X; 160-246-248-886-215; 160-263-143-608-248; 161-538-724-112-976; 162-196-644-044-968; 163-413-656-134-535; 163-926-847-617-824; 165-365-808-288-090; 170-851-664-310-256; 178-688-412-473-415; 179-348-929-516-428; 180-303-061-577-942; 185-327-956-961-556; 189-561-296-644-651; 195-459-088-993-271,71,true,,green

In this article, we extend this venue of research to explore service termination (i.e., whether to provide). In doing so, we adopt four theoretical strands developed in the fields of public policy and management to guide our research: policy termination, political economy, make-or-buy, and policy diffusion.; ; ; ; Methods; ; We utilize multiple International City/County Management Association surveys for our analysis. We supplement these data with information gleaned from a variety of other sources, including Census data, to construct a binary logistic regression model examining the determinants of service termination.; ; ; ; Results; ; We find that local governments are likely to terminate their services when they were previously outsourced to third-party contractors rather than produced by their own employees. Further, our results indicate that locales tend to drop services more often when they are not commonly provided by peer jurisdictions, supporting the idea of diffusion.; ; ; ; Conclusions; ; Our findings suggest that, despite a dearth of research undertaken, service termination is surprisingly common and widespread across service areas.",96,5,1453,1474,Public policy; Variety (cybernetics); Business; Marketing; Construct (philosophy); Service (business); Census,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/socsci/v96y2015i5p1453-1474.html http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.12218/abstract https://econpapers.repec.org/article/blasocsci/v_3a96_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a1453-1474.htm https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ssqu.12218,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.12218,,10.1111/ssqu.12218,2176124835,,0,000-563-690-406-875; 001-871-757-369-265; 002-185-038-893-534; 004-168-257-026-332; 004-871-501-136-993; 005-621-713-435-033; 006-819-098-827-210; 013-756-000-350-193; 014-694-012-786-985; 015-591-021-271-179; 019-434-952-009-589; 019-800-971-286-968; 021-657-305-204-695; 022-512-643-506-628; 026-907-816-497-320; 032-297-166-131-74X; 036-749-001-439-981; 036-961-749-635-681; 038-818-459-512-182; 039-652-519-537-445; 043-418-719-602-52X; 045-360-249-006-267; 047-904-973-994-142; 049-283-922-667-479; 049-856-258-034-045; 052-547-387-635-014; 058-071-798-060-611; 064-065-506-110-012; 064-139-115-256-806; 064-155-214-994-687; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-137-691-782-09X; 073-463-622-996-295; 073-476-220-819-029; 073-753-993-648-180; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-086-437-467-958; 078-157-136-881-392; 081-756-117-068-710; 084-868-812-380-816; 088-919-425-365-248; 089-246-733-306-824; 090-616-494-043-385; 093-815-943-562-692; 093-830-324-609-012; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-488-954-100-242; 106-371-804-149-721; 109-017-331-693-029; 115-482-499-323-938; 117-852-652-130-998; 133-690-120-174-851; 134-405-245-398-112; 134-601-172-231-765; 137-265-607-726-353; 142-958-728-230-920; 145-425-640-517-035; 146-379-268-595-433; 156-557-307-334-554; 166-877-511-984-875,3,true,,green

Policy diffusion of sustainable development principles,,2004,,,,,,Christof Pforr,"At the 1992 United Nations' Conference on the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janerio, governments and NGOs alike committed themselves to the paradigm of sustainable development as the shared goal of future development. But despite being manifested as a leading motive for future tourism development in many tourism policies, strategies and plans at all three levels of government in Australia, the implementation of the sustainability agenda appears to be a long and difficult process. More than a decade after the release of Australia's sustainable development policy, the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD), Australia's credibility depends on to what extent the implementation of the set goals has been successful. This paper will draw attention to research issues related to the implementation of ecologically sustainable development principles in tourism plans at the state and territory level, since so far the policy diffusion to the sub-national level has been frequently omitted in academic debate.",,,566,,Environmental resource management; Eco-efficiency; Government; Sustainable community; Political science; Tourism; Ecologically sustainable development; Sustainable tourism; Economic growth; Sustainable development; Sustainability,,,,,https://beta.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=202306411155287;res=IELBUS;subject=Business,https://beta.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=202306411155287;res=IELBUS;subject=Business,,,2210394124,,0,,3,false,,

Davis; Clare Brock,"Diet and nutrition are central to the wellbeing of communities, influencing the energy community members have to participate in the life of the community and the health outcomes of its members. Yet, community-level approaches to promoting nutritional health are inconsistent and vary across the world. This chapter proposes sustainable approaches to promote the nutritional health of communities based on the Social-Ecological Models and Policy Diffusion Models. We aim to describe nutrition and diet-related disparities in both the US and globally, discuss approaches that have been used to address these disparities, and finally, to outline potential strategies for building communities with sustainable food and nutrition plans that minimize disparities. We consider nutrition and diet-related disparities, hunger, and food insecurity in the US and across the world. We describe approaches that have been tried so far, including traditional interventions such as food distribution programs and education programs, as well as more recent approaches such as microloans and urban forests. We also discuss how cultural and political influences may influence diet-related disparity, such as how culturally preferred foods may affect efforts to improve diet quality and how political views of poverty may influence the types of policies considered acceptable to improve food access. Finally, we discuss areas that require continued research to improve communities’ nutritional health, such as improved mapping of nutrition problems and their barriers, how to implement more sustainable diets and food systems while respecting cultural foodways, and how to influence attitudes toward chronic poverty to expand the types of interventions available to policymakers.",,,145,199,Public economics; Political science; Poverty; Psychological intervention; Community health; Chronic poverty; Foodways; Food distribution; Sustainable agriculture; Food systems,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59687-3_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59687-3_5,,10.1007/978-3-030-59687-3_5,3125959384,,0,000-761-553-517-429; 003-820-330-109-141; 004-123-534-862-728; 006-542-049-256-248; 006-622-266-642-751; 006-933-598-181-46X; 012-562-667-798-429; 012-724-134-638-501; 013-141-325-574-493; 014-545-058-488-52X; 016-256-669-676-695; 016-500-808-862-052; 017-485-933-609-324; 019-521-628-315-731; 021-453-221-670-627; 024-082-058-701-399; 024-274-613-323-363; 024-859-529-616-300; 025-605-119-709-404; 028-159-234-801-056; 029-299-699-964-219; 029-477-162-159-307; 031-024-810-427-198; 032-044-415-041-898; 033-200-350-107-216; 033-777-638-324-611; 034-610-642-794-888; 040-222-768-830-832; 041-014-067-066-990; 043-458-725-373-213; 044-874-035-314-506; 046-198-453-763-445; 048-176-811-606-710; 048-919-105-074-969; 049-882-972-687-966; 052-799-577-592-298; 053-209-561-449-888; 054-882-853-664-746; 057-433-082-475-546; 058-071-798-060-611; 059-247-067-637-555; 060-307-920-757-595; 061-556-652-963-782; 062-525-700-500-622; 062-768-627-341-19X; 067-323-843-843-776; 067-755-896-362-502; 068-487-486-499-969; 070-238-679-333-070; 073-549-653-647-01X; 073-640-630-084-08X; 074-819-299-792-217; 076-240-693-922-091; 082-991-612-887-672; 083-088-111-279-201; 084-197-440-070-344; 084-464-003-367-602; 090-730-139-540-431; 091-590-934-908-463; 096-825-169-099-35X; 098-205-250-432-119; 098-359-061-597-995; 099-023-182-397-487; 106-415-073-972-467; 106-956-428-326-029; 108-319-788-239-149; 108-864-132-668-411; 110-006-368-809-402; 110-555-599-143-355; 111-706-675-036-917; 112-176-988-397-415; 112-303-041-547-598; 113-127-052-406-359; 125-170-138-736-796; 143-612-734-072-103; 144-829-896-791-112; 146-380-141-120-551; 146-695-600-016-224; 162-264-261-616-625; 166-101-794-026-168; 166-908-479-268-105; 172-930-576-763-106; 183-022-488-924-93X; 188-601-366-410-971,0,false,,

Desmarais; Matthew Burgess; Eugenia Giraudy,"The identification of substantively similar policy proposals in both proposed and adopted legislation is important to scholars of public policy diffusion and legislative politics. Conventional, manual, approaches are prohibitively costly in constructing datasets that accurately represent policymaking across policy domains, geographic units, and/or time. We propose the use of text-sequencing algorithms, applied to legislative text, to identify bills that introduce similar policy proposals. We present three ground truth tests, applied to a corpus of 500,000 bills from US-state legislatures. First, we show that bills introduced by ideologically similar sponsors are more likely to exhibit a high degree of text reuse. Second, we show that bills classified by the National Council of State Legislatures as covering the same policies exhibit a high degree of text reuse. Third, we show that rates of text reuse across state borders correlate strongly with the diffusion networks recently introduced by Desmarais, Harden and Boehmke (2015).",48,2,546,574,Public policy; Law and economics; Reuse; Council of State; Legislation; Similarity (psychology); Computer science; Identification (information); Legislature; Politics,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psj.12257 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/text-as-policy-measuring-policy-similarity-through-bill-text-reus,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/psj.12257,,10.1111/psj.12257,3124529175,,0,000-267-571-130-101; 003-592-471-884-916; 005-591-204-116-830; 005-692-270-875-15X; 010-109-013-685-881; 016-515-998-820-006; 016-781-352-160-530; 018-454-798-334-448; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-553-821-100-267; 021-586-878-418-193; 024-437-911-819-117; 025-112-618-417-304; 027-168-228-674-060; 028-373-705-126-470; 028-654-984-213-470; 028-897-238-918-280; 036-707-766-001-812; 043-891-468-492-373; 045-776-490-583-772; 047-812-993-541-791; 048-221-626-453-871; 048-368-272-885-242; 053-933-850-183-737; 055-590-201-363-763; 056-226-013-857-681; 056-793-094-521-67X; 056-956-808-248-85X; 058-071-798-060-611; 060-261-272-010-555; 061-793-046-506-062; 064-417-851-539-385; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-077-110-211-259; 070-069-276-399-185; 074-465-905-471-400; 075-089-695-295-014; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 078-544-962-568-939; 081-840-373-163-25X; 081-871-798-314-967; 082-956-910-630-580; 085-941-207-340-343; 091-787-232-273-706; 093-151-007-792-250; 093-190-746-631-057; 095-470-782-204-713; 099-075-376-116-297; 099-206-308-421-094; 099-359-487-508-386; 101-185-380-991-34X; 103-955-879-036-596; 104-802-847-671-543; 105-538-646-468-334; 114-086-345-293-931; 114-234-343-196-03X; 116-222-257-785-019; 120-911-773-457-984; 132-831-747-282-012; 136-570-912-209-71X; 140-426-918-539-857; 147-684-065-453-838; 155-580-858-393-517; 159-722-122-137-939; 174-768-369-809-642; 176-503-345-697-964,33,false,,
138-111-617-682-301,Why do countries implement Basel II? : an analysis of the global diffusion of Basel II implementation,,2013,dissertation,,,,,Young Bong Cho,"Like its predecessor, Basel II has profoundly shaped bank capital adequacy regimes across the world. However, there has been little systematic research on the state of Basel II implementation across developed and developing countries, and the factors that promote or hinder the implementation of these voluntary standards are particularly under-researched. By drawing on a new global dataset of Basel II implementation across 150 countries compiled by the author, this thesis evaluates the state of Basel II implementation at the global level and investigates why countries implement Basel II. Three novel channels of policy diffusion formed across supervisory authorities, global banks and financial sectors were specifically constructed to study the diffusion of Basel II policies using a mixed-method research design. A quantitative study tests the effects of policy diffusion on Basel II implementation across four distinct channels of diffusion formed by inter-supervisory authority networks, the cross-border structure of international banks, competition between financial sectors and the nexus of international economic exchange. This is complemented by in-depth case studies that unpack the causal process through which policy diffusion shaped the national implementation of Basel II in Chile, Hong Kong, Korea and Malaysia. I find that the state of Basel II implementation at the global level is highly uneven and clustered, and show that Basel II policy decisions in countries are highly interdependent on the policy decisions of other countries with which those countries are closely interconnected. Policy diffusion not only promotes the degree of convergence with Basel II, but also reinforces partial, gradual and delayed implementation. The diffusion of implementation policies can thus be a curse and a blessing for the future of Basel II and the broader global financial regulatory architecture due to its double-edged power to promote as well as hinder the degree of regulatory convergence with international financial standards.",,,,,Operational risk; Economy; Nexus (standard); Economics; Basel I; Interdependence; Convergence (economics); Basel II; Capital requirement; Financial system; Developing country,,,,,http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/678/1/Cho_Implement_Basel_II.pdf http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/678/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.579452,http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/678/,,,1488407127,,0,000-267-571-130-101; 002-171-159-410-917; 002-617-861-873-368; 003-385-208-991-130; 004-492-672-925-532; 004-550-198-566-220; 005-087-009-158-717; 005-232-175-187-714; 005-249-461-623-469; 006-275-908-043-264; 007-052-097-925-711; 010-070-285-257-789; 010-278-292-671-040; 010-297-483-353-575; 010-434-145-579-174; 011-497-790-292-357; 011-957-020-185-592; 012-891-541-045-672; 015-505-205-203-038; 017-032-468-776-458; 018-590-967-575-135; 021-020-976-292-827; 021-275-030-386-405; 021-799-517-543-385; 021-907-061-236-840; 023-470-523-768-387; 024-586-183-062-775; 027-711-475-487-942; 028-407-052-046-096; 028-867-813-757-704; 029-694-779-807-168; 030-213-103-929-136; 031-501-671-180-285; 033-671-216-534-410; 034-214-033-928-479; 034-277-783-905-290; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-368-895-460-388; 035-409-048-938-510; 035-870-065-215-256; 037-303-143-949-143; 037-723-307-670-490; 038-927-291-281-095; 039-318-000-420-191; 039-741-072-974-757; 040-739-114-535-043; 041-612-583-019-955; 041-971-447-940-197; 042-522-131-806-461; 043-128-091-155-633; 048-043-313-040-671; 049-589-659-484-684; 052-086-663-518-334; 052-357-677-476-851; 052-380-562-404-220; 052-682-316-812-37X; 055-061-969-609-130; 059-082-287-700-322; 060-496-817-590-26X; 060-915-363-080-102; 061-036-272-359-197; 061-054-885-411-161; 061-373-791-267-531; 062-971-329-256-863; 063-400-296-712-427; 065-423-746-506-124; 065-666-299-776-558; 066-141-735-734-026; 066-816-949-649-700; 067-660-358-303-351; 067-765-539-030-621; 068-079-414-072-613; 068-873-109-492-468; 069-280-264-531-116; 070-365-824-959-398; 072-862-908-678-93X; 074-465-905-471-400; 077-281-645-878-353; 077-926-704-396-107; 079-387-314-597-598; 082-017-566-839-450; 082-967-591-947-778; 083-758-220-137-712; 084-105-803-745-582; 084-392-647-828-232; 084-729-359-184-859; 084-833-686-434-480; 085-986-898-891-644; 086-016-682-585-743; 087-963-056-704-583; 088-993-237-313-315; 089-141-142-034-571; 089-892-280-654-426; 090-909-396-869-617; 093-190-746-631-057; 093-356-870-115-911; 094-529-668-406-626; 097-419-955-788-796; 099-243-916-927-243; 102-753-745-166-625; 103-377-559-100-569; 105-099-457-905-599; 105-526-785-996-251; 105-762-922-088-378; 105-861-358-096-222; 106-668-330-777-992; 108-166-013-954-847; 108-555-072-420-932; 109-066-514-573-821; 111-009-197-432-355; 111-454-841-746-140; 111-727-111-304-042; 114-591-298-117-86X; 115-410-220-184-836; 117-677-347-760-402; 118-780-346-083-042; 119-993-671-853-181; 123-841-240-202-354; 123-893-910-829-020; 124-038-979-856-51X; 125-594-636-972-168; 127-189-200-724-650; 129-143-350-106-785; 131-076-765-815-326; 132-314-232-662-897; 133-241-855-207-841; 133-267-651-968-193; 134-930-105-060-211; 139-153-398-330-745; 139-186-190-548-754; 144-117-644-991-729; 148-839-556-783-022; 149-119-152-031-167; 150-039-878-601-224; 150-444-392-623-801; 152-307-318-330-05X; 153-574-452-115-011; 154-907-385-529-562; 157-087-652-883-493; 158-929-879-963-812; 162-217-477-601-412; 164-779-345-467-992; 170-851-664-310-256; 172-319-849-222-115; 174-541-775-871-138; 174-592-204-494-535; 183-213-041-854-623; 183-261-725-246-481; 184-227-464-696-480; 185-793-566-489-450,1,false,,
138-398-555-534-098,From paradigm to policy - the implementation of ecologically sustainable development principles in tourism plans at Australia's sub-national level,,2003,,,,,,Christof Pforr,"At the 1992 United Nations' Conference on the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janerio, governments and NGOs alike committed themselves to the paradigm of sustainable development as the shared goal of future development. But despite being manifested as a leading motive for future tourism development in many tourism policies, strategies and plans at all three levels of government in Australia, the implementation of the sustainability agenda appears to be a long and difficult process. Ten years after the Earth Summit in Rio and ten years after the release of its sustainable development policy, the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustinable Development (NSESD), Australia's credibility depends on to what extent the implementation of the set goals has been successful. This paper will draw attention to research issues related to the implementation of Ecologically Sustainable Development principles in tourism plans at the State and Territory level. So far, the policy diffusion to the sub-national level has been frequently omitted in academic debate.",,,1453,,Environmental resource management; Government; Project commissioning; Political science; Tourism; Ecologically sustainable development; Credibility; Earth Summit; Public administration; Sustainable development; Sustainability,,,,,http://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=849565619475854;res=IELBUS,http://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=849565619475854;res=IELBUS,,,2208369922,,0,,0,false,,

THE PRIVATISATION OF THE TELEPHONE ORGANISATION OF THAILAND,,2009,,,,,,Issariyaporn Chulajata; Mark Turner,"There is considerable interest in how policies originating in one time or place are adopted in other places and times. Explanations of this phenomenon have been dominated by three approaches: policy diffusion, policy convergence and policy transfer. This article demonstrates that each approach has both strengths and weaknesses, and no approach can, on its own, does adequate explanatory justice to the complexity of policy transfer from rich to poor countries. The article uses the case of the transfer of telecommunications privatisation policy to Thailand to show this complexity and focuses on the Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT). The case is presented to support the argument that the interaction of domestic and international actors among the unique structural features and historical events of a particular place result in the modification of policies as they move between countries and after they have arrived at their new destination.",,,,,Economy; Economic Justice; Political science; Policy transfer; Convergence (economics); Market economy; Argument; Phenomenon; Strengths and weaknesses,,,,,http://web.usm.my/ijaps/articles/IJAP_2_Mark_(33-53)2.pdf http://ijaps.usm.my/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Mark-Turner.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Turner17/publication/228730734_WHAT_HAPPENS_WHEN_POLICIES_ARE_TRANSFERRED_THE_PRIVATISATION_OF_THE_TELEPHONE_ORGANISATION_OF_THAILAND/links/5455016f0cf2bccc490cc7fa.pdf,http://web.usm.my/ijaps/articles/IJAP_2_Mark_(33-53)2.pdf,,,2140778630,,0,003-160-185-329-904; 005-884-612-338-263; 010-044-217-090-607; 010-855-900-233-763; 012-437-260-285-493; 012-562-267-270-940; 016-719-489-998-441; 022-502-516-692-73X; 026-412-549-797-331; 036-611-003-244-131; 047-269-907-857-959; 049-219-615-824-319; 052-063-286-663-787; 052-341-107-616-481; 052-981-583-923-111; 068-180-270-093-250; 068-789-649-534-153; 072-862-908-678-93X; 077-742-037-754-188; 079-706-424-605-064; 080-111-133-969-266; 090-491-533-429-584; 092-201-499-656-891; 101-779-085-352-244; 115-604-021-260-635; 117-677-347-760-402; 123-694-573-650-975; 128-143-760-466-939; 131-099-007-834-538; 131-358-550-633-715; 147-133-857-499-702; 150-786-944-102-773; 164-752-085-915-436; 165-732-192-719-842; 176-164-685-301-715; 187-151-090-396-571,6,false,,

The dominant processes of environmental governance in China take the form of (i) many laws but state planning is dominant and (ii) intermediate crisis scanning procedures and policy responses on an irregular or episodic basis outside the confines of the Five-Year Plans or other national plans. The parallel processes in the US involve (i) law-centered practices including the enactment of legislation, the promulgation of regulations, and the judgments of courts and (ii) federalism/multi-level governance featuring initiatives/innovations at national and sub-national levels of government and policy diffusion. These institutionalized governance processes are more deeply embedded in the political and social systems of the two countries than the range of factors commonly considered in discussions of policy instruments. Both sets of institutionalized governance processes produce successes in addressing environmental problems under some conditions and failures under others. But the determinants of success in the two systems are not the same, and there is no reason to expect the two systems to converge during the foreseeable future. The analysis of environmental problem solving in China and the US illustrates the power of the general idea of institutionalized governance processes as a basis for research on comparative politics in a wide range of settings.",31,,163,173,Project governance; Sociology; Government; Multi-level governance; Environmental governance in China; Environmental governance; Corporate governance; Economic growth; Environmental studies; Economic system; Comparative politics,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378015000126 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378015000126 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5467922 https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/464576,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.01.010,,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.01.010,211340422,,0,000-971-322-700-272; 001-475-520-664-296; 006-355-761-761-404; 006-379-098-949-30X; 008-297-547-763-02X; 011-001-801-194-049; 021-639-788-261-846; 022-019-911-231-167; 023-251-779-540-319; 026-307-834-521-022; 027-476-935-174-14X; 038-006-626-673-749; 041-927-595-787-173; 048-521-251-425-587; 054-222-627-945-757; 060-040-428-192-561; 073-785-069-579-809; 077-086-283-884-057; 093-448-977-910-833; 141-678-543-219-132; 142-800-614-906-574; 143-441-943-011-004; 152-758-467-476-661; 170-467-952-913-725; 172-131-170-503-266; 179-332-650-624-759; 184-815-267-316-726,72,true,,green

The charge is that in trying to increase international legitimacy, governments copy institutional forms that are not suited to the local context. Yet, such mimicry is not the only driver of international policy diffusion. Domestic policy entrepreneurs learn from experiences of other countries and invoke global norms and values in advancing their preferred policy options. Pressures for mimicry can help such policy entrepreneurs counter resistance from domestic elites, especially in the case of value-based policies, such as transparency and anti-corruption policies. The cases of the Freedom of Information Act and the Asset Disclosure Laws in Romania are used to illustrate how external pressure for legitimacy can empower domestic policy entrepreneurs and facilitate a process akin to “problem-driven iterative adaptation” advocated by critics of isomorphic mimicry in public sector reform.

Comparatively, Flanders can be classified as an early moderniser, followed by the federal government, which had been locked longer in a trajectory of maintenance. The French-speaking governments of the Walloon Region and French Community are late modernisers, and compared to both the Flemish and federal government their reform efforts are more fragmented and incremental. The main factors explaining variations in administrative reform in Belgium are differences in institutional continuity, policy entrepreneurship and policy diffusion, all three of which combined to support administrative reform efforts at the Flemish and, slightly less so, at the federal levels, and were markedly absent in the French-speaking governments.

The processes of environmental leadership through policy diffusion that are at the core of this chapter occur as a result of learning, emulation, or adjustment of policy positions by actors in potential follower jurisdictions that then advocate the introduction of policy similar to the pioneering policy.

While many quantitative studies (regression analysis) take IOs into account as a factor for policy diffusion and confirm this influence, it has rarely been studied how (and with what instruments) IOs actually influence. This study undertakes two case studies of major actors within the diffusion of social cash transfers (SCTs). It develops an innovative framework for analyzing global actor's instruments and activities along three categories: advice, advocacy and incentives. With this framework this study examines how the World Bank advocates the policy model of Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) and HelpAge International pushes for Universal Social Pensions (USPs). This study confirms that IOs use instruments in all three dimensions in order to influence, showing that soft power instruments play a role of growing importance.",,,,,Public economics; Political science; Soft power; Order (exchange); Transfer (computing); Policy transfer; Cash; Cash transfers; Context (language use); Incentive; Public relations,,,,,https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/2911731,https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/2911731,,,2724166545,,0,,2,false,,

Mallinson,"The literature on the diffusion of policy innovations within the American federal system is well established and vast. That being said, there is still a great deal of work that is necessary for understanding why and how policies diffuse. This paper seeks to improve both our theoretical and empirical understanding of diffusion. First, it clearly lays out the theoretical foundation of three pathways of diffusion --- learning, competition, and conformity. Such a foundation has been lacking for the conformity pathway, in particular, and is crucial if the three are to be examined as co-equal explanations for diffusion. Second, this paper explicitly states and begins testing the empirical expectations regarding the characteristics of policies that follow each pathway. Such clarity is necessary if the mechanisms are to be sorted out. Finally, a finer method for measuring diffusion speed is presented. This is necessary as the diffusion literature has only recently begun to examine variation in the speeds by which policies diffuse and a continuous measure of speed will be far more useful to future work than the current dichotomous measure.",,,,,Public policy; Positive economics; Diffusion (business); Conformity; Political science; CLARITY; Variation (game tree); Competition (economics); Foundation (evidence); Social psychology; Social learning,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=2109083 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2109083,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2109083,,,269948333,,0,003-592-471-884-916; 005-261-328-376-894; 036-961-749-635-681; 101-127-387-013-017,0,false,,

A broad view of environmentalist reform in Latin America easily reads as top-down diffusion of blueprints and institutional convergence. But such a thesis is reductionist and ultimately misleading, case studies demonstrate. First, diffusion mechanisms matter for divergence: when normative and mimetic mechanisms are relatively strong vis-a-vis coercive forces, formal state change is followed by more meaningful real state change; when the coercive mechanism rules unmatched, green state change ends up being formal for the most part. Secondly, institutional entrepreneurs face shifting opportunity structures for political change; because these opportunities are never uniform, national experiences will differ. Thirdly, national institutional environments provide contrasting domestic resources and cultures for the building of green states; legacy, in short, will condition translation by entrepreneurs. A bridging institutionalist framework helps us make sense of “converging divergence”.",49,2,242,265,Blueprint; Economics; Reductionism; Divergence (linguistics); State (polity); Opportunity structures; Face (sociological concept); Convergence (relationship); Normative; Development economics; Economic system,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12116-013-9147-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12116-013-9147-6/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12116-013-9147-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12116-013-9147-6,,10.1007/s12116-013-9147-6,2080657816,,0,000-191-531-767-134; 000-458-369-709-760; 003-025-422-339-881; 010-725-868-080-473; 011-104-666-786-86X; 012-914-276-552-751; 015-151-158-429-820; 015-271-876-692-523; 017-365-317-397-94X; 020-661-534-440-259; 022-512-643-506-628; 024-573-103-691-30X; 027-206-956-903-807; 027-245-327-605-139; 027-827-119-143-849; 028-210-471-090-113; 032-213-417-749-309; 032-929-209-988-704; 033-852-662-613-736; 038-158-590-298-168; 039-318-000-420-191; 040-119-974-707-901; 043-499-687-260-656; 043-802-411-858-277; 043-965-740-811-097; 045-763-377-895-376; 050-135-925-988-893; 050-228-436-622-092; 050-371-531-964-500; 051-606-887-814-765; 054-222-627-945-757; 055-078-193-772-731; 055-985-058-486-803; 057-161-106-323-218; 057-521-752-054-506; 058-028-014-085-084; 060-188-343-841-105; 063-405-425-636-081; 064-353-825-643-322; 068-932-176-027-280; 070-349-501-731-348; 071-258-784-044-347; 071-384-786-610-389; 074-108-562-194-628; 077-945-151-328-246; 078-257-733-348-148; 078-891-133-849-510; 079-239-338-482-723; 082-199-454-425-229; 084-001-465-924-433; 084-995-084-309-350; 085-145-561-157-114; 092-283-796-804-493; 094-725-818-009-385; 095-043-526-258-660; 096-075-186-196-434; 096-180-676-351-18X; 096-735-746-700-717; 097-654-427-607-349; 098-512-001-476-719; 102-444-187-583-213; 103-804-660-323-269; 104-473-964-328-811; 107-591-146-740-86X; 108-638-258-220-078; 110-451-727-998-889; 110-827-115-207-102; 114-176-392-369-715; 114-890-297-758-833; 115-482-499-323-938; 117-295-565-102-383; 117-789-482-960-550; 117-887-002-210-216; 117-967-208-012-178; 118-677-913-472-111; 121-656-974-147-713; 121-885-054-390-680; 125-069-507-280-186; 127-283-762-520-271; 130-003-712-898-152; 135-795-506-082-056; 138-229-822-344-516; 138-980-019-076-584; 142-608-813-622-806; 150-446-990-916-734; 153-645-314-660-631; 156-586-921-097-184; 157-609-499-757-284; 160-970-696-779-63X; 165-596-578-665-003; 165-734-105-751-852; 166-896-362-161-632; 168-471-174-413-635; 170-470-513-377-227; 170-973-145-367-571; 174-350-856-426-51X; 176-216-923-447-448; 179-167-383-952-910; 187-432-715-552-011; 193-713-640-246-658; 194-826-486-441-312; 195-459-088-993-271; 196-826-669-515-209,20,false,,

It uses Weibull distribution and Cox regression to measure the time until events occur and to estimate the influence of a variety of factors on the likelihood of two policies being adopted. I find evidence of electoral-year drive policy diffusion in both countries. In Brazil, a key structural variable associated with internal determinants stimulated metropolitan policy adoptions.

142-442-687-820-467,Learning by Doing or Learning from Others? Diffusion of Information in International Trade Dispute Settlement Mechanisms,2013-08-12,2013,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Jennifer A. Laks Hutnick,"To what extent does learning from others influence future state behavior? Further, do states learn more from their own or the experiences of others? While previous research has found that states learn from their own previous experiences in trade disputes within regional and multilateral organizations, which influences the likelihood a state will use that same mechanism in future trade disputes, researchers have yet to examine the effect of the experience(s) of another member state on the likelihood of a state uses these dispute settlement mechanisms. Herein, I examine whether, and the extent to which, a state applies knowledge acquired from its own and the previous experience of others to forum shopping decisions in future international trade disputes. I argue that the ability of the prior experiences of others to yield learning through policy diffusion is influenced by a state’s learning capacity. It does so by influencing the transparency, accuracy, and availability of information derived from the experiences of other states in trade disputes. A state’s learning capacity is a function of the relationship between the state that had the experience and the state trying to learn from it. I test my expectations using an original data set on the initiation of trade disputes at the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Andean Community (CAN), Common Market of the South (Mercosur), Central American Common Market (CACM), and World Trade Organization (WTO) between 1995 and 2010. I find support for my expectations associated with direct learning and learning through policy diffusion. States learn through both forms but learning has a greater effect on future forum choice through direct experience. Further, I find that the magnitude of the difference between these two forms of learning depends on state’s learning capacity.",,,,,International trade; Political science; State (polity); Member state; Direct experience; Forum shopping; Transparency (behavior); Learning-by-doing (economics); Single market; International law,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2301897_code1526588.pdf?abstractid=2301897&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2301897,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2301897,,,2283914489,,0,006-722-686-316-360; 008-925-304-648-072; 010-070-285-257-789; 012-231-483-198-393; 012-286-853-432-764; 013-301-942-493-672; 014-665-673-746-128; 015-553-948-247-089; 017-971-141-152-411; 018-434-359-804-534; 019-220-566-291-957; 021-929-968-573-375; 023-817-821-464-293; 023-843-404-656-218; 031-364-337-057-021; 035-653-295-831-934; 035-825-313-382-561; 036-027-080-650-261; 039-965-462-223-601; 041-575-325-535-754; 046-225-893-032-612; 047-280-665-635-014; 047-383-980-792-951; 047-424-199-792-02X; 048-086-392-950-218; 048-473-027-447-470; 051-702-854-533-692; 052-723-818-069-06X; 058-222-028-498-030; 058-927-464-777-677; 059-489-311-498-342; 060-629-517-891-622; 061-054-885-411-161; 063-914-470-613-175; 064-512-910-434-838; 068-511-397-988-231; 073-010-552-165-821; 074-848-711-523-098; 075-983-726-428-382; 078-181-457-294-025; 078-365-896-605-880; 098-645-002-501-33X; 099-130-021-053-935; 102-783-538-395-254; 105-305-899-504-332; 105-894-188-129-423; 113-741-307-551-153; 114-190-777-251-823; 117-087-895-908-084; 117-677-347-760-402; 120-610-824-268-907; 137-223-065-506-077; 142-998-368-482-353; 146-549-140-588-946; 155-734-391-815-446; 163-145-773-402-959; 171-328-982-608-111; 174-949-347-287-989; 180-752-741-622-149; 186-303-919-518-520; 190-589-210-315-882; 192-749-162-622-759,1,false,,

Motta,"Policy makers frequently learn from the policy experiences of other governments. Lessons inform decision making, diffusing policy across borders. Using interviews with key policy actors and a comparative analysis of United States and European policy contexts, this study identifies and describes causal mechanisms through which newly emerging offshore wind energy policies diffused across governmental borders. In so doing, this article demonstrates a new approach to understanding policy learning and diffusion to complement the largeâ€ N, quantitative analyses that form the bedrock of the literature. The findings support the argument that future studies must account for policy diffusion between subnational and foreign national governments, as well as diffusion between coequal administrative agencies in different policy subsystemsâ€”â€œdirectionsâ€ of diffusion that are invisible to traditional methods, yet likely to become increasingly common in the face of climate change and other wicked problems.ae”?c­–ae‰©ae•£a’ŒaeŒ‡a ‘ae€§i¼sa¯¹ae—©aeœŸe‡‡co³aeµ·a¸Se£Žeƒ½ae”?c­–cs„e?½e¸a ae”?c­–aˆ¶a®se€…ae—¶a¸¸a»Ža»–a›½ae”?aoœa¸­a­¦aˆ°ae”?c­–c» eaŒa€‚e?™ao›c» eaŒc©?e¶Sa›½a®¶e¾¹c•Œ, e®²e?°ao†aeœ‰a…³a†³c­–cs„ae‰©ae•£ae”?c­–a€‚e€se?‡a¯¹a…³e”®ae”?c­–eiŒa¸oe€…e?›eiŒe ¢e°ˆ, a Œae—¶a¯¹c¾Ža›½a’Œae¬§ae´²ae”?c­–eƒŒae™¯e?›eiŒae¯”e¾ƒaˆ†aež , aeœ¬c ”c©¶e¯†aˆ«a¹¶ae e?°ao†a¸ a Œcs„a› aežœaeœoaˆ¶, aeµ·a¸Se£Žeƒ½a’Œc›¸a…³ae”?c­–e€se?‡e?™ao›aeœoaˆ¶aœ¨a „a›½ae”?aoœe—´e?›eiŒae‰©ae•£a€‚a¸oae­¤, aeœ¬ae–‡e¯ ae˜Žao†a¸€c§ ae–°cs„aeŽaae–½, c”¨a»¥c †e§£ae”?c­–a­¦a¹ a’Œae”?c­–ae‰©ae•£, e?›e€Œa¯¹a¤§ae•°e‡ a®se‡ aˆ†aež i¼ˆthe largeâ€ N, quantitative analysesi¼‰e?›eiŒei¥a……, a Že€…ae˜¯ae–‡cŒ®cs„aŸoci€a€‚c ”c©¶c»“aežœe®¤a¸o, aeœaae ¥c ”c©¶a?…ei»e˜ e?°aœ°ae–¹ae”?aoœa’Œa›½a¤–ae”?aoœa¹‹e—´cs„ae”?c­–ae‰©ae•£, a»¥a Sa¸ a Œae”?c­–a­ c³»c»Ÿa¸‹a¯¹c­‰eiŒae”?aeœoaež„a¹‹e—´cs„ae”?c­–ae‰©ae•£â€”e?™c§ ae‰©ae•£cs„â€œae–¹a ‘â€ ae˜¯a¼ c»Ÿae–¹ae³•ae— ae³•e§‚a¯Ÿaˆ°cs„a€‚DifusiA³n De PolA­ticas y Direccionalidad: delineando La AdopciA³n Temprana De PolA­ticas De EnergA­a EA³lica MarA­tima Los creadores de polA­ticas aprenden frecuentemente de las experiencias polA­ticas de otros gobiernos.

143-005-321-537-174,EU Environmental Policy and its Effect on U.S. Chemical Regulation,,2017,,,,,,Benjamin Hemche Billberg,"The purpose of this paper was to assess how the EU chemical regulation, REACH, affected the reform of the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act. It borrows from theories of policy diffusion and of the EU as a regulatory power, which were used to theorize two causal mechanisms potentially leading to convergence between the European and American chemical regulations, tested using a method of process-tracing. The first is a theory based on competition and market power, explaining that firms exporting to the EU necessarily had to adapt to REACH, provoking rent-seeking at home. The second is based on learning, and argues that American lawmakers took lessons from the EU experience with REACH. Both models were found to be faulty. The first undervalued the effect of a large domestic market, and overvalued the effect of submitting to foreign regulations. The second model made the faulty assumption that, under certain circumstances, learning from REACH would necessarily lead to doing as REACH. Furthermore, the TSCA reform ended up diverging from REACH in key areas. More nuanced models can give a better understanding of both how policy converges and of the EU’s regulatory influence.

When MPs make such references, the diffusion of policy ideas from one country context to another can occur. This article explores policy diffusion in plenary debates by answering the following questions: to what extent do references by MPs to the policies of other countries change over time and across policy areas; and what are the country- and policy-specific drivers of, respectively, the number of references to other countries and how MPs use information on policy experiences from other country contexts? The results of the analysis of Dutch Lower House debates on education and environmental policies for the period 1995–2012 show that the cross-national diffusion of policy ideas by MPs follows a punctuated equilibrium logic. Moreover, Dutch MPs refer more often to policies of larger countries and of EU member states. Finally, in policy fields with a high likelihood of externalities, the diffusion of policy ideas from the three countries most referred to by MPs occurs mainly through the mechanism of interdependence.",52,2,133,155,Political economy; Sociology; Punctuated equilibrium; Externality; Law; Context (language use); Lower house; Parliament; European union; Cross national; Comparative politics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Fap.2015.29 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Ascholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl%3Aitem_3199454 https://link.springer.com/10.1057/ap.2015.29 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ap.2015.29/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/ap.2015.29,,10.1057/ap.2015.29,2270693002,,0,004-006-989-680-119; 005-341-403-549-91X; 008-568-621-372-433; 010-760-865-068-229; 011-283-444-646-534; 027-726-661-711-380; 033-512-235-921-776; 033-674-686-008-566; 033-969-989-312-301; 042-848-125-795-604; 051-262-866-921-848; 052-136-789-432-045; 053-049-085-069-656; 056-161-139-422-611; 072-656-121-187-654; 073-833-718-144-99X; 077-926-704-396-107; 080-285-338-290-10X; 083-128-427-871-272; 097-357-653-208-038; 097-859-177-268-792; 101-488-954-100-242; 111-487-711-368-832; 112-558-084-910-89X; 115-200-705-822-925; 117-437-899-273-263; 118-513-543-976-791; 122-818-695-579-228; 126-910-485-153-71X; 127-807-528-981-832; 131-934-689-934-750; 132-314-232-662-897; 148-460-439-813-652; 155-580-858-393-517; 156-586-921-097-184; 158-926-736-232-728; 168-463-317-071-063; 173-182-390-007-973; 175-608-105-481-042; 194-670-902-015-454; 197-130-035-969-410,4,false,,

This article analyzes the enactment of restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants in 29 European countries – a conflictual issue which does not fit easily traditional party ideologies. Indeed, the comparative empirical analyses demonstrate that government ideological positions are not associated with the strictness and the timing of adoption of the smoking bans. On the other hand, economic factors like the scale of tobacco production in a country, smoking prevalence in society and public support for tough anti-smoking policy are all significantly related to the time it takes for a country to adopt smoking bans, and to the comprehensiveness and enforcement of these restrictions. In addition, horizontal policy diffusion is strongly implicated in the pattern of policy adoptions.",91,2,448,468,Political economy; Government; Ideology; Economics; Enforcement; Tobacco control; Public support; Policy making; Economic growth; Scale (social sciences); Politics,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2012.02075.x/full https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2012.02075.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9299.2012.02075.x,,10.1111/j.1467-9299.2012.02075.x,2099353249,,0,000-219-747-237-37X; 002-494-549-964-989; 002-557-636-257-591; 002-605-007-617-404; 004-581-128-255-760; 006-318-776-911-804; 007-472-095-170-256; 009-122-187-375-390; 009-736-794-382-134; 011-307-700-432-249; 011-799-061-141-544; 012-784-814-043-856; 013-721-955-273-688; 013-771-847-187-331; 014-697-106-026-42X; 014-957-181-615-126; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-655-811-865-129; 020-442-346-688-468; 028-119-083-455-267; 030-716-612-544-343; 032-716-914-544-667; 035-622-914-349-564; 042-393-247-698-230; 044-958-408-877-837; 045-920-678-617-78X; 046-987-880-775-311; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-311-363-521-385; 051-052-228-146-036; 055-984-160-102-285; 057-304-126-803-126; 058-071-798-060-611; 061-069-492-622-226; 061-904-727-066-671; 061-973-970-085-871; 062-407-280-073-902; 062-858-833-041-795; 065-087-878-920-87X; 067-163-960-502-364; 068-527-009-607-748; 069-996-545-188-151; 070-628-472-664-060; 074-105-243-667-156; 074-881-381-853-266; 076-240-693-922-091; 078-690-076-366-131; 080-285-338-290-10X; 080-883-627-988-010; 082-935-382-089-440; 084-910-340-397-172; 085-540-733-708-702; 086-236-694-813-04X; 087-613-160-678-338; 091-586-419-955-239; 094-049-567-201-733; 094-585-621-391-03X; 098-419-626-337-536; 101-127-387-013-017; 108-384-147-997-602; 109-600-495-192-018; 113-720-938-418-161; 115-667-337-333-237; 116-672-218-645-089; 120-981-630-575-557; 124-307-277-038-558; 125-065-731-462-111; 125-996-263-737-027; 131-702-347-092-933; 132-819-828-269-838; 133-593-649-746-974; 134-158-534-474-200; 138-785-407-078-625; 152-236-364-100-452; 154-314-204-508-516; 155-682-962-752-601; 159-867-907-282-746; 161-273-970-347-825; 163-076-040-775-567; 163-926-847-617-824; 165-365-808-288-090; 174-138-943-975-287; 176-020-059-141-432; 180-494-153-347-743; 181-504-461-576-241; 188-007-362-092-361; 194-575-687-278-394; 196-138-387-526-269,17,true,,green

Bennett,". The introduction of information technology to governmental agencies has raised considerable concern for the erosion of personal privacy in most advanced democratic states. This article compares and tries to explain the choice of policy instrument in four key countries (Sweden, the United States, West Germany and the United Kingdom) to enforce the protection of personal data. Five options were available from the ‘international repertoire’ of solutions: voluntary control, subject control, licensing, a data commissioner and registration. The Swedes opted for licensing, the Americans rely on subject control, the Germans established a data commissioner and the British chose a registration scheme. In no state, however, were these decisions made from a synoptic analysis of all possible options. Nor did a process of policy diffusion occur. Rather, a combination of domestic constraints seemed to filter out unacceptable options and produce a bias in favour of the resulting policy instrument. In the United States and Sweden, this bias resulted from perceived constitutional imperatives; in West Germany and Britain, the position and power of the respective national bureaucracies produced stiff resistance, a conflictual policy process and resulting policy instruments with few, if any, precedents in their respective systems.",16,5,437,466,Information technology; Economics; Position (finance); Control (management); State (polity); Resistance (psychoanalysis); Public administration; Filter (software); Bureaucracy; Democracy,,,,,https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1988.tb00163.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1988.tb00163.x,,10.1111/j.1475-6765.1988.tb00163.x,1990229459,,0,006-110-828-224-473; 006-492-175-097-791; 010-532-667-820-761; 023-769-304-575-338; 030-327-387-186-359; 038-624-112-896-513; 040-425-548-814-638; 045-025-359-148-508; 050-487-419-966-877; 058-365-358-709-724; 065-460-433-143-898; 074-638-600-775-473; 093-662-786-316-898; 160-875-411-667-832,8,false,,

In this context, the aim of this paper is to verify if the charity hazard phenomenon exists in the Italian agricultural insurance scheme.,Annual data regarding crop insurance, subsidies and farm structure were extracted from ISMEA, ISTAT and FADN databases. A SYS-GMM dynamic panel model was estimated, considering the 2010–2017 time period and the Italian Regions as units of the analysis.,The empirical results highlight a negative relation between crop subsidies and the farmers' policies and total premium paid. The disincentive and crowd-out effects of public aid and subsidies on the choice of whether or not to take out an agricultural insurance policy ends up being one of the key factors for the low level of penetration of the agricultural insurance in Italy.,Since the diffusion of agricultural insurance can contribute to the general objective of sustainability and resilience, the implementation of alternative solutions to subsidies could be needed (e.g. the introduction of mandatory insurance against adversities or financial support for a geographically specific insurance tool).,Investigating empirically the determinants of the agricultural insurance policy diffusion among the Italian Regions, this study ensures an original contribution to the scientific progress in the field, demonstrating the existence of charity hazard caused by the public subsidies provision.",81,2,237,249,Public economics; Agriculture; Business; Empirical evidence; Crop insurance; Context (language use); Hazard; Insurance policy; Crowding out; Subsidy,,,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AFR-04-2020-0061/full/html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/afr-04-2020-0061,,10.1108/afr-04-2020-0061,3082035908,,0,005-126-744-002-937; 008-280-984-755-086; 011-066-607-141-127; 011-158-933-617-985; 014-373-780-279-380; 024-317-219-800-333; 025-479-232-399-888; 026-402-262-478-043; 036-681-457-201-463; 042-335-426-642-552; 042-450-919-287-935; 043-488-731-053-870; 043-594-818-047-165; 044-525-132-437-115; 046-127-203-871-082; 046-127-440-118-73X; 046-343-395-177-20X; 047-676-918-660-420; 047-700-390-662-432; 053-691-391-507-78X; 057-538-941-966-089; 058-765-299-387-19X; 069-193-150-753-655; 082-643-090-110-936; 084-347-957-222-372; 084-801-317-385-349; 090-721-634-358-333; 107-182-850-532-59X; 117-627-802-046-329; 118-386-053-797-978; 132-558-492-977-554; 134-916-268-642-821; 137-874-441-585-880; 150-772-260-519-378; 159-655-489-584-762; 183-319-323-518-05X; 186-516-868-978-410,5,false,,

This complete streets policy framework has emerged as an important tool for communities to improve opportunities for active living with over 500 policies adopted nationwide. Complete streets policy diffusion has been rapid, but uneven, and the extent to which policy adoption is making a difference in the implementation of projects at the local and regional level is unclear. This research project seeks to address this need through a national survey of the 385 metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) around the country, evaluating the extent to which complete streets policies are being adopted and implemented at the MPO level, what opportunities and barriers to complete streets exist, and implications for future policy diffusion and innovation efforts.",,,,,Business; Metropolitan area; Active living; Complete streets; Policy implementation; Public administration; Economic growth,,,,,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/31274 https://trid.trb.org/view/1371742,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/31274,,,2175205329,,0,018-163-399-538-582; 028-549-571-373-412; 039-008-738-081-655; 041-596-673-548-693; 050-677-030-440-786; 051-157-578-959-29X; 099-063-400-861-337; 119-471-034-140-770; 140-077-618-309-969; 148-890-118-899-942; 197-276-366-601-858,1,false,,

Taking China's national independent innovation demonstration zone (NIIDZ) policy as an example, this paper empirically investigates the impact of China's innovation policy on haze pollution by using a difference-in-differences (DID) model. The results show that the NIIDZ policy promotes the governance of urban haze pollution and confirms the applicability of the experimentalist governance model in the practice of innovation policy in developing countries. Dynamic analysis shows that the NIIDZ policy has an experience accumulation effect. This policy can continue to promote haze control for at least 6 years, and the policy effect increases year by year. Action mechanism analysis shows that the NIIDZ policy can inhibit urban haze pollution by promoting urban technological innovation and high-tech industrial agglomeration. The estimation results of the spatial DID model show that the NIIDZ policy not only inhibits haze pollution in NIIDZ cities but also has an inhibitory effect on haze pollution in the surrounding non-NIIDZ cities and the NIIDZ cities, which confirms the positive externality characteristics of policy diffusion theory and environmental governance. The conclusions of this paper have important theoretical value for understanding the ecological effect of innovation policy and provide experience for developing countries to implement an experimentalist governance model.",317,,115465,115465,Corporate governance; China; Haze; Externality; Environmental governance; Business; Economic system; Order (exchange); Economics; Economic geography; Economic growth; Natural resource economics; Political science; Geography; Finance; Meteorology; Law; Microeconomics,Haze control; Industrial agglomeration; National independent innovation demonstration zone; Policy diffusion; Technological innovation,Air Pollution/analysis; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution/analysis; Policy,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115465,35751266,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115465,,,0,002-441-471-275-067; 005-962-767-387-917; 016-519-162-756-911; 021-655-257-173-134; 024-681-223-927-215; 029-992-791-901-320; 031-497-829-460-06X; 031-508-911-695-184; 036-733-735-615-87X; 037-941-912-898-130; 047-619-350-896-586; 048-059-257-569-162; 053-349-281-233-083; 061-240-754-011-060; 063-441-559-436-753; 068-259-085-977-283; 068-583-694-056-492; 074-907-949-570-406; 082-187-649-149-975; 086-216-752-861-616; 090-649-964-110-409; 092-867-394-153-404; 096-500-876-583-567; 097-393-353-664-195; 098-447-715-119-133; 104-901-192-945-649; 107-227-058-205-559; 112-138-339-527-569; 113-458-212-359-747; 113-676-756-043-033; 117-221-537-048-576; 118-513-543-976-791; 127-232-404-397-007; 128-852-171-170-20X; 145-123-790-687-255; 167-623-924-191-52X; 174-363-853-942-159; 195-069-031-319-59X,1,false,,

The literature of political science asserts that such programs have been widely implemented because they correspond to an alternative policy strategy adopted by governments facing opposition to implement universal public policies. So, political competition would be at the root of CCT launching. This article presents an alternative explanation. From 1995 to 2001, local governments created or emulated the Bolsa Escola Program (BEP) in all regions of the country. Such a path continued after the launching of the national Bolsa Escola by the federal government. Why did some local governments decide to adopt the national BEP and others did not? To answer these questions, the research tests the influence of structural, internal and external variables on the dissemination of CCT programs. Two main hypotheses are tested. The first asserts that local political competition is positive for policy diffusion. The second hypothesis claims that party alignment between the municipal and federal levels increases the likelihood of municipalities adopting the federal BEP. The research uses Event History Analysis to test statistically the impact of political incentives on policy diffusion among Sao Paulo State’s municipalities. Two types of policy diffusion are examined: horizontal and vertical. The findings confirm that political competition influences the horizontal diffusion among municipalities. Unexpectedly, vertical diffusion does not occur because of party alignment or political competition. Rather, levels of socioeconomic development drive policy emulation.",,,,,Public economics; Public policy; Government; Cash transfers; Local government; Conditional cash transfer; Opposition (politics); Competition (economics); Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2505410 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2505410_code1000423.pdf?abstractid=2505410&mirid=4,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2505410,,,3125968701,,0,001-016-638-553-927; 006-902-155-088-74X; 010-786-133-682-640; 015-591-021-271-179; 016-937-048-893-746; 018-454-798-334-448; 025-826-626-668-87X; 027-128-952-167-530; 028-088-843-119-727; 031-318-852-376-118; 033-786-486-087-286; 036-961-749-635-681; 039-373-878-461-823; 039-422-867-104-685; 039-664-709-632-96X; 050-274-654-059-514; 066-141-735-734-026; 078-572-338-742-129; 087-535-931-939-575; 093-190-746-631-057; 100-548-136-504-080; 101-035-423-273-580; 108-166-013-954-847; 111-533-042-559-328; 117-677-347-760-402; 133-087-716-464-773; 142-739-519-814-372; 145-647-086-916-672; 158-868-403-828-213; 158-936-603-235-254; 163-076-040-775-567; 163-637-734-144-951; 177-438-235-402-633,0,false,,
146-622-073-557-549,"Politics, Institutions, and the Implementation of Growth Management Policy in Florida Cities",,2005,,,,,,In-Sung Kang,"This study originated from the following two questions: to what extent do city governments engage in policy actions to restrict development and manage growth; and how do local political institutions shape the restrictiveness of local growth management? To answer the questions, first of all, this dissertation identifies variations in the exercise of growth management powers across cities based on financial data gathered from fiscal reports filed with the Florida Comptroller, and policy implementation/adoption data gathered in a mail survey conducted by the author in collaboration with Richard Feiock and Antonio Tavares. Information on city level political institutions and governing structures is gathered from the International City Management Association's (ICMA) 2001 Form of Government Survey. Based on information about growth management expenditure and policy adoption/implementation, this study examines a broad set of government institutions extended to include the size and organization of city councils and standing committees. This research focused on the implementation and exercise of discretionary powers as well as policy adoption in relation to growth management based on a political market approach. In the political market approach, focusing on the demander and supplier help us understand internal forces of growth management policy. Finally, acknowledging that the underlying theory of institutions in this work is applicable to cities, this study attempts to identify cities' spatial impact on expenditures for growth management. Referring to policy diffusion theory, we review the impact of neighboring cites' on comprehensive planning expenditure as identifying the internal and external forces by using of political market and spatial effect model. In this research, the followings are the core parts we focus on implementation of growth management policy: local comprehensive planning expenditures, zoning request approval, and policy enforcement of the innovative policies. We considered the role of local institutions as supplier, political economy demands, and municipal context. For the hypotheses tests, we employ three different kinds of statistical analysis: spatial regression, ordered probit, and probit analysis.%%%%A Dissertation submitted to the Askew School of Public Administration and Policy in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of;  Philosophy.%%%%Spring Semester, 2005.%%%%March 25, 2005.%%%%Comprehensive Planning, Growth Management Politics, Land Use Management%%%%Richard C.

Several themes shaped that transition: universal service as a key policy challenge for the incoming ANC government; the evolution of universal service as a key global issue within the telecomms reform agenda; the series of universal access and service interventions adopted in South Africa; and the widely perceived failure of most of these policy interventions.

Sokhey; Annie Miller,"Arizona's recent passage of Senate Bill 1070 has reignited a national debate over illegal immigration (and immigration more generally), bringing language politics back to the fore. Over the last one-hundred years, states have intermittently introduced and passed legislation declaring English as the exclusive language of government services. However, tremendous variation in the introduction, success, and timing of such measures exists. Patterns of English-Only legislation are categorized by neither region or time period.

Gardner,"In the American system of federalism, states have almost complete freedom to adopt institutions and practices of internal self-governance that they find best-suited to the needs and preferences of their citizens. Nevertheless, states have not availed themselves of these opportunities: the structural provisions of state constitutions tend to converge strongly with one another and with the U.S. Constitution. This paper examines two important periods of such convergence: the period from 1776 through the first few decades of the nineteenth century, when states were inventing institutions of democratic governance and representation; and the period following the Supreme Court’s one person, one vote decisions in the early 1960s, when the Court’s destruction of the existing constitutional model created an important opportunity for states to experiment with alternative forms of legislative representation. In the first period, initial innovation and diversity were followed quickly by convergence and isomorphism; and in the second period, no burst of innovation occurred at all. After reviewing studies of institutional isomorphism and policy diffusion from other fields, the paper concludes that the facts best fit explanations based on the resort by constitutional drafters to well-known patterns of non-rational decision making such as “availability” and “anchoring” heuristics. American state constitutions thus likely display little diversity in their structural provisions not because prevailing models have proven superior to the alternatives, but because imitating the choices of seemingly similar entities is a common way to dispatch cognitively challenging tasks.",,,,,Political science; Law and economics; Law; Constitution; State (polity); Supreme court; Diversity (business); Federalism; Isomorphism (sociology); Autonomy; Legislature,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2391447 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2513950_code535672.pdf?abstractid=2391447&mirid=5&type=2 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2391447,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2391447,,,77976868,,0,,0,false,,

De Jong; Deborah Roempke Graefe; Shelley K. Irving; Tanja St. Pierre,"Objectives. Our objectives are to describe the policies adopted after PRWORA, which vary across states, to test for common underlying policy concepts, demonstrating how these policies are interrelated, and to examine whether policy stringency diffused to neighboring states results in greater policy stringency across all states over time. We convert textual TANF welfare guidelines into empirically derived policy dimensions and use the derived quantitative scores to describe variation and change in welfare policy dimensions across status during the 1996–2003 post-welfare-reform period.; ; Methods. Utilizing the Urban Institute's Welfare Rules Database, we apply a factor analytic methodology to 78 unique state policy guidelines that were coded on a lenient-to-stringent continuum. Regression analyses, employing spatial contiguity weighting, are used to describe policy diffusion.; ; Results. The results identified 15 underlying first-order post-welfare-reform policy dimensions, which for scientific parsimony were further reduced to three second-order underlying dimensions representing rules governing eligibility: eligibility requirements for groups, behavioral responsibilities for maintaining eligibility, and eligibility time limits and exemptions. Analysis of the quantitative scores showed that by 2003 states had become more lenient regarding eligibility criteria for groups but decidedly more stringent regarding behavioral guidelines for maintaining eligibility and eligibility time limits and exemptions. Spatial clustering is not found globally but is significant for some states at the local level. Spatial diffusion is apparent only for behavioral rules.; ; Conclusions. Our results suggest that TANF policy variations across states go beyond payment levels to include salient eligibility rules. The patterns of variability in change scores across states do not support a pervasive “race to the bottom” conclusion.",87,4,755,781,Public economics; Welfare; Payment; Regression analysis; Economics; Weighting; Social policy; Race to the bottom; Quantitative analysis (finance); Social Welfare,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bla:socsci:v:87:y:2006:i:4:p:755-781 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00432.x https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/socsci/v87y2006i4p755-781.html https://www.jstor.org/stable/42956155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00432.x,,10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00432.x,2068685854,,0,003-377-905-825-971; 003-388-849-860-847; 007-438-102-617-513; 008-653-694-174-709; 010-923-338-266-008; 012-245-139-397-905; 015-868-062-417-989; 021-443-145-613-348; 021-630-397-545-920; 024-471-923-742-910; 028-730-064-064-304; 034-275-134-700-94X; 034-576-609-343-931; 038-623-323-979-226; 041-968-042-712-391; 049-947-451-552-26X; 054-250-842-253-014; 059-757-340-935-028; 060-106-870-544-186; 065-042-906-279-487; 065-296-005-360-202; 080-774-345-881-159; 087-439-290-370-55X; 088-062-843-972-331; 091-736-584-918-934; 099-278-831-020-423; 180-174-949-880-858; 186-917-484-914-167; 196-198-185-374-898,62,false,,

In this analysis, I consider how local economic and political conditions, as well as the rail promotion activities of a state's contiguous neighbors, impacted a legislature's rail promotion decisions. The findings suggest that states only engaged in rail promotion when local infrastructure was of poor quality and a state's tax revenues were sufficient to support rail expenditures. These findings reveal that diffusion, powered by social learning, does not drive all state policy innovations. Instead, local conditions and parallel thinking are important factors in state policy development. Furthermore, the analysis underscores the power of local governments in the antebellum period, while also raising the question of whether such diffuse state building was effective.",25,02,117,142,Tax revenue; Business; Power (social and political); State (polity); State-building; Market economy; Promotion (rank); Social learning; Legislature; Politics,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-american-political-development/article/local-rail-innovations-antebellum-states-and-policy-diffusion/ECFE281C3326CBBFAE745BA73436AEE4 https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0898588X1100006X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0898588x1100006x,,10.1017/s0898588x1100006x,2097064665,,0,000-733-443-534-174; 001-328-701-270-077; 001-500-207-423-316; 001-871-757-369-265; 001-888-622-582-334; 006-300-556-601-999; 010-064-046-308-429; 010-211-196-249-708; 012-245-139-397-905; 013-581-507-209-832; 014-948-960-893-059; 016-719-663-798-673; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-507-965-164-922; 019-314-586-787-623; 020-812-859-028-911; 022-055-196-467-442; 022-636-015-172-369; 024-124-914-784-864; 027-128-952-167-530; 032-164-929-841-901; 033-969-989-312-301; 034-576-609-343-931; 035-270-821-125-258; 035-610-131-534-538; 035-902-866-847-986; 036-847-606-622-366; 036-961-749-635-681; 041-794-014-797-415; 043-086-374-377-479; 044-958-408-877-837; 045-532-564-302-777; 046-882-303-960-612; 046-954-573-466-93X; 049-631-772-670-995; 052-707-624-077-846; 061-635-962-186-128; 063-467-464-997-422; 063-538-112-631-334; 067-490-686-317-462; 068-061-573-059-058; 068-239-101-390-987; 069-893-212-388-081; 070-044-907-339-816; 075-988-419-280-034; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-214-519-988-797; 078-086-437-467-958; 081-394-527-119-95X; 082-724-506-911-767; 083-797-299-914-968; 084-444-032-409-228; 086-275-803-615-563; 086-703-952-899-06X; 090-612-474-464-547; 093-788-961-279-582; 094-013-756-801-426; 096-517-829-236-651; 096-774-920-400-560; 101-127-387-013-017; 102-268-448-442-292; 102-373-054-488-276; 104-650-834-138-838; 106-389-014-684-012; 108-406-468-431-014; 109-581-103-469-815; 114-954-723-201-019; 115-613-441-990-997; 115-664-467-190-170; 117-988-761-272-189; 118-295-437-099-956; 121-709-110-188-469; 121-947-735-039-803; 123-969-473-315-766; 127-586-029-676-511; 136-488-899-892-40X; 137-674-676-505-121; 142-510-737-723-115; 142-529-664-304-509; 144-761-878-352-96X; 147-410-300-710-999; 150-184-073-013-119; 151-867-781-308-603; 154-314-204-508-516; 158-820-995-392-472; 160-916-177-650-810; 162-984-817-069-002; 163-076-040-775-567; 164-504-772-112-448; 164-756-112-665-398; 167-942-257-201-293; 168-521-285-805-968; 176-306-096-567-989; 177-145-364-982-110; 178-986-468-936-322; 179-147-333-467-564; 180-533-316-618-886; 187-344-715-819-134; 187-367-423-102-627; 188-894-991-532-706; 189-587-769-308-152; 194-844-231-032-946,2,false,,

The first has mainly focused on e-government, drawing on the theory of innovation diffusion as a general framework, while the second has mainly applied the administrative policy diffusion framework to the specific case of American states. Inspired by institutional theory, this second framework has not been applied to the case of European local governments. Furthermore, each framework has been mobilized by studies examining separately one of the two levels of e-government diffusion: website implementation or website services development. The aim of our paper is to examine if technological and administrative policy innovation factors impact the level of e-government development by municipalities. For that purpose, the paper collected data from a sample of 5,108 municipalities located in the French Grand Est region.",,,,,Diffusion (business); Business; Institutional theory; Regional science; Government; Work (electrical); Innovation diffusion; Sample (statistics),,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:hal:journl:hal-02536413,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:hal:journl:hal-02536413,,,3123591786,,0,,1,false,,

Boushey,"This article builds on punctuated equilibrium theory to evaluate the diffusion of public policy innovations in the United States. The article argues that punctuated equilibrium theory provides a unifying framework for understating three mechanisms leading to the diffusion of innovations: gradual policy diffusion driven by incremental policy emulation, rapid state-to-state diffusion driven by policy imitation and mimicking, and nearly immediate policy diffusion driven by state-level responses to a common exogenous shock. Drawing upon the Bass mixed influence diffusion model, this research generates measures of the coefficients of external and internal influences for diffusion for 81 public policy innovations that have spread across the United States. The article then evaluates how the policy image and direct participation of the federal government contribute to distinct patterns of diffusion over time.",40,1,127,146,Public economics; Public policy; Diffusion (business); Macroeconomics; Punctuated equilibrium; Economics; Diffusion of innovations; Direct participation; Sociological theory of diffusion,,,,,http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/90322/1/j.1541-0072.2011.00437.x.pdf http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/90322 https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/90322/j.1541-0072.2011.00437.x.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00437.x/pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00437.x https://core.ac.uk/display/3148359 https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/90322/1/j.1541-0072.2011.00437.x.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00437.x,,10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00437.x,1558335739,,0,000-239-483-883-762; 001-328-701-270-077; 001-481-906-279-295; 002-557-636-257-591; 003-910-374-826-467; 004-548-382-860-670; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-692-270-875-15X; 006-210-850-922-09X; 006-282-272-395-98X; 008-180-005-498-322; 011-374-181-788-517; 012-883-251-761-670; 017-005-921-463-828; 018-769-346-177-716; 028-462-493-017-161; 031-762-133-647-285; 032-164-929-841-901; 035-571-700-057-534; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 039-664-709-632-96X; 049-561-974-880-973; 050-082-471-457-812; 050-950-951-032-538; 051-240-639-024-947; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-218-427-846-811; 063-504-944-027-038; 067-490-686-317-462; 069-801-727-795-240; 071-361-180-414-699; 073-166-408-788-371; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-292-312-519-129; 077-413-548-207-63X; 079-539-152-611-43X; 084-154-879-306-982; 084-787-681-556-687; 086-138-747-294-329; 089-150-970-638-439; 093-190-746-631-057; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-858-508-751-657; 106-352-974-752-749; 117-437-899-273-263; 120-663-144-372-929; 123-288-456-400-05X; 124-006-664-396-030; 129-840-947-235-233; 134-300-624-191-268; 142-654-492-516-830; 142-730-058-228-029; 148-460-439-813-652; 149-479-005-872-184; 155-580-858-393-517; 159-867-907-282-746; 163-637-734-144-951; 197-130-035-969-410,70,true,,green

Borrowing both from the literatures on policy diffusion as well as on the influence of small member states in EU decision-making, we argue that such an influence is fostered by both structural and agency-related factors. We illustrate this potential influence with a case study on the regulation of micropollutants in waterbodies. Adopting a mixed-method approach, we show that the upstream location of Switzerland, its integration into transnational networks as well as joint water basin institutions provides the country with structural opportunities to diffuse policy innovation to the EU’s policy agenda and member states’ policies. In addition, agency-related factors matter as the EU or member states can point to Switzerland as a; successful example or pioneer, especially since the Swiss policy is in line with an overall EU strategy on reducing negative impacts of chemicals on humans and the environment.",,,,,Drainage basin; Upstream (petroleum industry); International trade; Political science; Water Framework Directive; Member state; European union; Member states; Environmental planning; Politics,,,,,https://boris.unibe.ch/67092/,https://boris.unibe.ch/67092/,,,2534968923,,0,,0,false,,

This article assesses this convergence by testing the propositions of policy diffusion theories and arguing that the explanations of the recent privatization wave need to incorporate the interaction between diffusion mechanisms and domestic factors. Through a paired comparison between Chile and Argentina, the study shows that the combination of external pressures with domestic support from the government and an absence of domestic contestation were crucial for global privatization ideas to be fully adopted in Chile, while in Argentina the absence of domestic factors accounted for a partial policy emulation. The article concludes that although coercive, mimetic and normative diffusion constrained policymakers’ choices, domestic interests produced a variety of responses to these pressures.",20,2,1,16,Variety (cybernetics); Political economy; Government; Latin Americans; Economics; Process tracing; Convergence (economics); Normative; Development economics; Education reform; Qualitative comparative analysis,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13876988.2016.1239321,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13876988.2016.1239321,,,2537006480,,0,002-884-188-140-960; 008-975-669-498-834; 009-077-086-042-730; 010-067-415-838-470; 012-752-708-619-640; 012-858-732-879-173; 013-982-597-348-197; 016-429-141-645-527; 016-768-781-321-121; 017-590-559-877-752; 017-798-857-606-638; 018-969-276-182-814; 019-467-641-346-466; 021-532-027-994-64X; 026-120-712-360-232; 026-412-549-797-331; 026-955-776-437-871; 033-067-920-226-760; 034-464-553-881-450; 035-793-202-642-89X; 036-981-317-086-824; 038-018-704-954-369; 048-442-937-665-336; 048-794-840-237-836; 049-219-615-824-319; 051-185-768-200-40X; 058-110-266-116-353; 063-149-938-949-77X; 065-666-299-776-558; 068-217-918-015-690; 070-365-824-959-398; 076-284-062-381-350; 077-945-151-328-246; 078-775-724-371-928; 080-089-911-394-57X; 080-329-379-199-312; 091-729-566-642-692; 093-190-746-631-057; 097-619-405-643-951; 111-820-232-181-612; 115-667-337-333-237; 117-295-565-102-383; 117-635-777-979-273; 124-231-648-945-125; 125-328-222-790-40X; 128-646-293-431-642; 129-038-185-433-517; 130-489-672-755-458; 134-543-230-921-797; 146-736-847-331-689; 152-023-803-112-350; 154-338-313-642-489; 160-167-613-400-59X; 179-167-383-952-910; 181-624-271-631-496,4,false,,

Our results highlight an inefficient structure, suggesting lags in policy spreading. We identify Minnesota, California and Florida to be the main ""facilitators"" of the dynamics. Targeting them ensures the maximum likelihood of policy diffusion across the country. We then evaluate the determinants of the inferred network. Our results emphasize the role of contiguity and wealth in policy transmission. We also find sustainable economic systems as well as state's expected economic losses due to climate change as critical factors of environmental policy flows.",,,,,Climate change; Diffusion (business); Economics; Economic geography; State (polity); Critical factors; Environmental policy; Network approach; Maximum likelihood; Contiguity,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/fae/wpaper/2020.12.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/fae/wpaper/2020.12.html,,,3117460999,,0,,0,false,,

Méndez,"The global health agenda has been dominating the current global health policy debate. Furthermore, it has compelled countries to embrace strategies for tackling health inequalities in a wide range of public health areas. The article by Robert and colleagues highlights that although globalization has increased opportunities to share and spread ideas, there is still great asymmetry of power according to the countries’ economic and political development. It also emphasizes how policy diffusion from High Income Countries (HICs) to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) have had flaws at understanding their political, economic, and cultural backgrounds while they are pursuing knowledge translation. Achieving a fair global health policy diffusion of ideas would imply a call for a renewal on political elites worldwide at coping global health politics. Accordingly, moving towards fairness in disseminating global health ideas should be driven by politics not only as one of the social determinants of health, but the main determinant of health and well-being among — and within — societies.",,,,,Public health; Political economy; Sociology; International health; Globalization; Knowledge translation; Public administration; Global health; Health policy; Social determinants of health; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2472817 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2472817_code2083529.pdf?abstractid=2472817&mirid=2 https://core.ac.uk/display/26414177,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2472817,,,2133035459,,0,018-811-611-290-637; 100-910-850-896-076; 106-131-395-274-341; 132-245-273-564-816,0,false,,

Chwieroth,"Abstract: Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), government-owned or managed investment vehicles, have proliferated at a remarkable rate over the past decade, even as political controversy has surrounded them. Why? The extant literature depicts the process of SWF creation as driven by functional imperatives associated with ""excess"" revenue and reserves accumulated from commodity booms and large current account surpluses. I argue that SWF creation also reflects in large part a process of contingent emulation in which first this policy has been constructed as appropriate for countries with given characteristics, and then when countries took on these characteristics, they followed their peers. Put simply, fashions and fads in finance matter for policy diffusion. I assess this argument using a new dataset on SWF creation that covers nearly 80 countries from 1984 to 2007. The results suggest peer-based contingent emulation has been a crucial factor shaping the decision of many countries to create a SWF, especially among fuel exporters.;",131,,36,,Finance; Sovereign wealth fund; Economics; Financial market; Revenue; Investment (macroeconomics); Commodity; Foreign direct investment; Market economy; Current account; Politics,,,,,http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/44997/ https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1656369_code1512364.pdf?abstractid=1643861&mirid=5&type=2 https://ncgg.princeton.edu/IPES/2012/papers/S900_rm2.pdf http://www.ihs.ac.at/publications/pol/pw_131.pdf http://www.gbv.de/dms/zbw/720838088.pdf https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/document/31442/1/ssoar-2012-chwieroth-fashions_and_fads_in_finance.pdf https://www.ihs.ac.at/publications/pol/pw_131.pdf https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/31442 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1643861 https://ssrn.com/abstract=1643861 https://irihs.ihs.ac.at/2149/ http://aei.pitt.edu/39281/1/pw_131.pdf,http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/44997/,,,1627148527,,0,003-020-141-849-727; 005-249-461-623-469; 005-730-190-216-87X; 006-722-686-316-360; 006-808-513-146-735; 007-764-191-298-537; 011-957-020-185-592; 014-074-130-766-865; 014-361-917-848-575; 015-271-876-692-523; 017-928-849-887-225; 019-387-957-666-204; 022-532-468-081-48X; 031-853-916-398-434; 034-277-783-905-290; 035-149-466-756-287; 036-159-702-886-637; 038-100-333-779-209; 040-144-448-232-55X; 042-757-106-341-611; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-105-560-487-244; 050-023-430-724-646; 050-825-835-763-250; 060-629-517-891-622; 064-980-246-016-490; 065-666-299-776-558; 065-990-223-615-250; 066-141-735-734-026; 068-064-188-258-310; 069-234-214-082-351; 069-596-058-184-206; 070-029-806-944-990; 070-139-323-848-248; 071-846-033-952-37X; 073-197-710-013-616; 076-560-998-668-082; 077-588-784-518-266; 077-926-704-396-107; 078-184-718-117-005; 085-841-607-651-847; 087-082-663-029-540; 093-190-746-631-057; 095-343-352-543-81X; 097-419-955-788-796; 105-526-785-996-251; 107-624-625-672-057; 111-032-714-834-308; 112-333-966-495-520; 120-939-497-280-485; 120-995-812-526-825; 131-076-765-815-326; 133-087-716-464-773; 139-153-398-330-745; 139-214-052-553-542; 142-977-700-291-055; 143-068-194-002-721; 144-932-109-488-073; 145-047-319-889-865; 152-888-034-762-107; 158-165-629-916-119; 159-635-339-655-90X; 164-997-718-765-817; 165-888-035-133-021; 168-453-343-491-839; 189-239-827-167-853; 196-278-201-549-820,6,false,,

Since this issue seems a purely legal matter dealt with at the federal, European and international level, we should expect similar, almost identically shaped policies at the Lander level. However, the analysis brings considerable variations of constitutional activities in this field to the fore: time, frequency, and contents of respective initiatives vary significantly in the period from 1999 to 2014. These variations were due to different party strategies, diverging party platforms and majority constellations in the Lander. The analysis also shows that the public arguments brought forward in favour of constitutional amendments refer only weakly and randomly to legal provisions and processes at other levels. The political debate supporting extended children's rights rather refers to general observations, to the specific regional context, and constitutional provisions in other Lander. At least with regard to this issue, the multi-level system did not systematically impact on constitutional politics in the Lander. It rather can be understood as an opportunity structure providing parties with multiple realms in which they can pursue their goals. Thus the study shows that federal and regional party strategies are key factors in explaining policy diffusion in multi- level systems.",7,1,1,29,German; Political science; Public law; Party platform; Law; Context (language use); Field (Bourdieu); International level; Constitutional economics; Politics,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/91072798 http://www.on-federalism.eu/attachments/206_download.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=7293502,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pof-2015-0002,,10.1515/pof-2015-0002,2184280216,,0,003-412-189-797-295; 007-505-364-291-792; 008-515-114-130-908; 011-219-207-621-257; 012-074-868-902-402; 013-309-230-248-616; 016-409-338-575-229; 016-451-614-176-101; 017-942-075-456-827; 018-054-833-768-848; 025-249-042-235-387; 028-905-995-991-124; 029-694-779-807-168; 037-691-156-530-226; 049-312-354-899-772; 050-245-588-740-877; 052-201-386-466-679; 052-438-460-830-105; 055-753-452-711-367; 056-670-822-480-74X; 064-567-436-409-886; 071-708-307-599-716; 088-129-550-557-752; 092-063-569-626-83X; 102-479-501-184-510; 109-201-298-340-247; 113-870-049-628-963; 123-910-112-757-669; 133-240-248-801-158; 134-807-765-860-325; 139-880-673-101-99X; 152-236-364-100-452; 172-999-637-082-271; 179-617-629-080-100; 196-583-091-425-288; 198-204-307-417-763,6,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

On the other hand, in relation to OGD, the level and dynamic interplay of the field has outpaced the capacity of scholars to supply rigorous analysis of OGD developments particularly in relation to NGOs. This thesis seeks to fill that gap in terms of knowledge regarding NGOs working (internationally) on the access to and use of government information and data, as key players in policy diffusion processes.; In particular, the literature shows that ICT has a profound impact on the structure of all organisations. Due to the limited scholarship in these areas (NGOs in FOI and OGD and the impact of ICT in these organisations), elements from the existing research on other aspects of FOI and NGOs are included, together with elements of the impact of ICT in other organisations.; The influence of ICT in these international organisations highlights the differences not only between FOI and OGD but also among organisations.; This thesis presents two different levels of analysis in order to explain the differences not only between the organisation working in FOI and OGD but also the divergences within in each of the fields. After analysing some of the common features of professionalised NGOs, divergences between both fields arise. In that sense, the strong legal background of the main FOI organisations, as well as within individual advocates, influenced the approach to the advocacy and the tools to reach new countries and regions. On the other hand, the critical overview of some of the main international actors in the OGD field demonstrates the clear importance and influence of ICT developments in this area and for these actors. The nature of organisational topics, the structure of the organisations, as well as the vision of their funders, they are all connected to the technological developments of the past couple of decades.; While the analysis of some of the common features allows for the a first level of distinctions between both field, the research on the passage of bureaucratic organisations to post-bureaucratic organisations, borrowed from managerial studies, provides the elements to understand the differences between organisation working in the same field.; While some organisations are organically and intellectually shaped to operate in a digitally dominated environment others are just starting to adapt to this new way of operating. By analysing the crucial impact of ICT in these organisations, the different influence in each of the fields and within them can be clearly understood.",,,,,Government; Political science; Freedom of information; Open government; Legislation; Scholarship; Public relations; Civil society; Bureaucracy; Information and Communications Technology,,,,,https://eprints.utas.edu.au/23437/,https://eprints.utas.edu.au/23437/,,,2614318233,,0,,1,false,,

The Political Construction of Dyke Raising in France, the Netherlands and the United-States",,2014,,,,,,Joana Guerrin; Gabrielle Bouleau,"In the 1990s, public policies of flood risk prevention in France have changed in nature. Construction of protective infrastructure that prevailed since the nineteenth century was challenged. The flood was then on characterized as inevitable phenomenon in town that was beneficial in rural areas. Criticisms raised against the natural disasters guarantee system adopted in the 1980s. This paper replaces this evolution in a broader context by comparing the French model to the United States and the Netherlands, where corps of engineers have played an important role. We show how these national policies have built territories both privileged and very dependent on the state. We trace the influence of environmental movements in the production of new models at the international level. The French evolution can thus be understood as both an endogenous dynamic and the result of international policy diffusion.",21,1,89,109,Public policy; Rural area; Economy; Natural disaster; Geography; State (polity); Context (language use); Phenomenon; Flood myth; Politics,,,,,https://www.cairn-int.info/abstract-E_RIPC_211_0089--protection-or-threat-the-political.htm,https://www.cairn-int.info/abstract-E_RIPC_211_0089--protection-or-threat-the-political.htm,,,2735371950,,0,,0,false,,

Proactive release of big open data (BOD) by the governmental entities is on the way around the globe. Pakistan’s Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2013 has been considered the compelling cause of big open data policy innovation adoption among governmental entities. Taking big open data from the viewpoint of policy innovation, this study draws on both Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory and its application to public policy innovation research to examine Pakistan’s BOD policy diffusion patterns at government and public bodies’ level. These patterns are based on policy declaration timing by the governments, policy adoption timing, development of technological applications, and proactively released datasets statistics in public bodies. An Event History Analysis is carried out to examine BOD policy innovation diffusion. Results shows that Federal government is the innovator for the policy innovation diffusion across different governments and subsequent public bodies. We have also found that efficacy ranking of public bodies is quite low in terms of developing BOD technological platforms and proactive release of datasets in large quantities.

In order to understand the development of cash transfers in Indonesia, it is necessary to examine the long-term policy evolution in the context of national politics. This paper analyses the policy evolution of cash transfers in Indonesia, focusing on the policy decision process at the national level since the Asian economic crisis. It tracks three critical conjunctures of social protection for the poor in which Indonesia tried to adapt cash transfer schemes and institutional frameworks, and eventually consolidated the social protection system. Cash transfers have been adapted in Indonesia in keeping with the strong political motivations of top policymakers for popular support in the context of democratisation, but policy transfers of cash transfers provided an important impetus for the development of social protection system in Indonesia.",,,,,Economic policy; Business; Democratization; Order (exchange); Policy transfer; Social protection; Cash; Cash transfers; Context (language use); Politics,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:een:appswp:201534,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:een:appswp:201534,,,3125203243,,0,,0,false,,

In order to analyze this issue from an economic point of view we develop a simple two-country-model of the taxation of emissions in presence of (possible) policy diffusion. Contrary to the usual Nash setting of simultaneous decision making we consider a Stackelberg game: In the first step the domestic government introduces an emission tax td thus acting as Stackelberg-leader, in the second step the foreign government decides whether or not to introduce an emission tax tf and in the third step the firms decide on their output quantities to be sold on a third country’s market. For the case of an exogenous given probability of policy diffusion we show that the optimal domestic tax rate is c.p. the higher, the higher the probability of policy diffusion is. Moreover, we explore under which conditions first-mover behaviour by the domestic government leads to a higher tax rate compared to the Nash solution In the next step we introduce an endogenous probability of policy diffusion by combining our model with a strategic lobbying approach. As a result, the probability of policy diffusion is c.p. the smaller, the higher domestic tax rate td is. Consequently, in fixing the optimal tax rate the domestic government has to account for the foreign firm’s lobbying activities otherwise it will choose a tax rate too high.",,,,,Value-added tax; Indirect tax; Tax credit; Economics; Microeconomics; Optimal tax; Tax rate; Double taxation; Tax reform; International taxation,,,,,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/30818 https://ideas.repec.org/p/aug/augsbe/0302.html https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/30818/1/577049496.PDF https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:aug:augsbe:0302 http://www.wiwi.uni-augsburg.de/vwl/institut/paper/302.pdf,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/30818,,,1601853336,,0,010-606-186-820-276; 021-907-061-236-840; 025-336-617-303-834; 059-544-147-171-119; 088-993-237-313-315; 089-069-980-374-029; 108-166-013-954-847; 117-677-347-760-402; 125-268-617-755-543; 144-007-003-985-655; 173-240-390-629-361; 174-745-047-599-927,0,false,,

Weak democracies with poor pandemic preparedness were considerably more likely to opt for SOEs than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness.

This paper asks whether, in the presence of direct democratic institutions, spatial interactions additionally result from voters' direct actions. The proposed mechanism is that the voters' actions in vetoing a decision or inaugurating a preferred policy by a binding initiative in their jurisdiction can potentially have spillover effects on the actions of voters and special interest groups of neighboring jurisdictions. Utilizing data on around 1,800 voter-petitions across over 12,000 German municipalities in 2002-09, we find that a jurisdiction's probability of hosting a petition is positively driven by the neighbors' direct democratic activity. These effects are persistent, and are stronger for more visible instruments of direct democracy. The interactions are also mostly driven by petitions in same or similiar policy areas, and are stronger in towns with relatively more per capita newspapers.",,,,,Special Interest Group; Per capita; Political economy; Political science; Jurisdiction; Competition (economics); Public administration; Direct democracy; Spillover effect; Democracy; Yardstick,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/zbwzewdip/15054.htm https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/zewdip/15054.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/zbwzewdip/15054.htm,,,2658954845,,0,,0,false,,
160-727-629-750-060,"Foreign law in domestic courts: Different uses, different implications",,2010,,,,,,Christopher A. Whytock,"Author(s): Whytock, CA | Editor(s): Jackson, DW; Tolley, M; Volcansek, M | Abstract: One can be forgiven for wondering if the debate about references to foreign law in U.S. court opinions is much ado about nothing.1 In none of the cases that sparked the debate - Atkins v. Virginia,2 Lawrence v. Texas,3 and Roper v. Simmons4 - did the U.S. Supreme Court treat foreign law as binding law that could override U.S. law. Nor, as two recent articles empirically demonstrate, is the use of foreign law by U.S. courts anything new.5 For courts in other countries, the use of foreign law is ""decidedly commonplace.""6 Ye t ""[t]here is little evidence to suggest parallel mobilization in opposition to foreign citations by courts abroad""7 - which suggests that the controversy in the United States indeed might be disproportionate to the problems posed by comparativism in judicial decision making. As Noga Morag-Levine states, ""Supreme Court opinions are replete with references to extra-legal sources such as philosophical treatises and social science research. Why single out foreign case law as deserving of special condemnation?""8 After a careful analysis of the debate, Mark Tushnet concludes that what really is motivating critics of foreign law in U.S. courts is concern about the appropriate scope of judicial power, not foreign law per se.9 Nevertheless, the question of foreign law in domestic courts is an important one. Skeptics correctly warn that the use of foreign law - at least in the context of constitutional interpretation - raises serious issues of constitutional theory10 and comparative methodology. 11 Those more sympathetic to the use of foreign law not only disagree with skeptics' arguments that there is no ""constitutional license"" to use foreign law,12 but also claim that a greater willingness of domestic courts to use foreign law can improve the quality of constitutional decision making. The focus of existing research and commentary on both sides of this debate is on the constitutional issues associated with references to foreign law in U.S. court opinions and, more generally, on the important normative concerns about whether and how domestic courts should use foreign law. This work, however, focuses little attention on the actual consequences of domestic court references to foreign law and therefore eventually relies on untested empirical assumptions about what those consequences might be. 13 Nonconsequentialist reasons to favor or disfavor foreign law in domestic courts exist, of course. Ye t a well-informed, normative dialogue must be attentive to consequences, at least if it is to extend beyond the narrow confines of more formal variants of constitutional theory. The use of foreign law in domestic courts also raises interesting questions of positive theory - particularly about the relationship between different uses of foreign law and the cross-border migration of legal norms that so far are unexplored. For these reasons, this chapter proposes a social science approach that focuses on the empirical implications of foreign law in domestic courts. Unfortunately, the existing literature does not provide the conceptual foundations for exploring these implications. Scholars generally appreciate that domestic courts can use foreign law in different ways and that these differences are analytically significant, but the result has been an overabundance of typologies of different uses and a lack of conceptual clarity. Therefore, in the main part of this chapter, I will attempt to take a small conceptual step forward by consolidating into a single, manageable typology the many different uses of foreign law in domestic courts that already have been identified by scholars. No single typology can be useful for all purposes, and ultimately an empirical project motivated by a particular theory calls for concepts that are motivated by the same theory. Thus the goal is modest: to provide a language for a preliminary exploration of the empirical implications of different uses of foreign law that may be useful to a wide range of scholars. Next, I will build on the typology by considering the consequences of different uses of foreign law in domestic courts and the role of domestic courts as agents in processes of norm internalization and transnational policy diffusion. In particular, I will use the typology to examine the claim made by some critics that foreign law references in U.S. court opinions lead to the internalization of non-U.S. norms into U.S. society by changing domestic law or policy. Finally, I will suggest several avenues for future research on foreign law in domestic courts and domestic courts as institutional pathways for norm internalization. The central message is simple: Different uses of foreign law have different implications for the cross-border migration of legal norms, and both normative theory and positive theory should take these differences into account14. © 2010 State University of New York.

Smith,"AbstractThe global diffusion of public policies is never just the conduct of rational agents looking for the best solutions that ‘work’, but is always embedded in political and institutional interests. Dominant models of policy diffusion tend to ignore the role of oligarchic wealth in policy diffusion. Oligarchic diffusion's defining feature is lack of democratic accountability. Mayor Michael Bloomberg's appropriation of the Mexican conditional cash transfer model for ending poverty undermined the political accountability of urban policy-making in New York City. Some of the prevailing diffusion models elide the historically specific political and institutional interests driving the diffusion of the neoliberal policy solutions now in global circulation. Oligarchic diffusion is a dominant mechanism implicit in the other typologies. Fortunately, elite-driven policy diffusion models are not the only game in town. More democratic modes of global policy diffusion exist and show promise of better things to come.",1,2,118,131,Public policy; Neoliberalism; Economics; Multi-level governance; Globalization; Accountability; Rational agent; Democracy; Economic system; Politics,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21622671.2013.808162 https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21622671.2013.808162,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21622671.2013.808162,,10.1080/21622671.2013.808162,2002596871,,0,008-914-217-222-934; 014-271-911-369-267; 032-689-677-143-374; 034-813-253-938-235; 048-846-133-812-979; 052-806-424-065-940; 077-945-151-328-246; 086-163-694-850-604; 086-948-562-453-375; 094-245-137-240-829; 095-443-703-624-215; 095-926-166-209-070; 128-890-792-936-56X; 162-243-310-298-027; 167-232-072-704-533; 199-137-145-745-009,12,false,,

162-096-307-943-198,A conceptual device for spreading (good) territorial governance in Europe,,2014,,,,,,Umberto Janin Rivolin; Giancarlo Cotella,"Is it possible to spread good territorial governance in Europe and, if so, in which ways can such aim be achieved? This paper presents a conceptual device, developed within the ESPON project TANGO (Territorial Approaches for New Governance), usable to manage the spread of examples or ""features"" of good territorial governance in Europe. It is worth clarifying that this paper does not face the issues of defining what is ""good"" in territorial governance, nor of what can or should be transferred in this complex domain; problems thatthe aforementioned research project has also met. It focuses rather on modalities of transfer, particularly on ""paths and means"" through which (good) territorial governance might pass from one place to another or others, and on their major strengths and weaknesses. In order to achieve this aim vis-a-vis the well-known complexities of policy transfer (see, amongst others: Dolowitz & Marsh 1996, 2000; James & Lodge 2003), the proposed framework builds on the authors' previous reflections about Europeanization of territorial governance (Cotella & Janin Rivolin 2010). This approach welcomes the assumption that, for institutional matters, policy transfer in the European Union (EU) and Europeanization are arguably two sides of the same coin (Wishlade et al. 2003).The EU is indeed an institutional context in which «the apparatus of policy diffusion and development has transnationalised in such a profound and irreversible way as to render anachronistic the notion of independent, ""domestic"" decision-making» (Peck 2011: 774). The institutional nature of territorial governance and of its changing is thus a fixed point of the proposed conceptual device: therefore, whereas potentially generalisable and adaptable to other institutional contexts, its application is here tailored on the EU's context",,,175,179,Political science; Order (exchange); Management; Peck (Imperial); Law and economics; Policy transfer; Face (sociological concept); Context (language use); European union; Corporate governance; Strengths and weaknesses,,,,,http://porto.polito.it/2531490/ https://iris.polito.it/handle/11583/2531490,http://porto.polito.it/2531490/,,,56560517,,0,,3,false,,

Schoenefeld; Kai Schulze; Nils Bruch,"Adapting to some level of climate change has become unavoidable. However, there is surprisingly limited systematic knowledge about whether and how adaptation policies have diffused and could diffuse in the future. Most existing adaptation studies do not explicitly examine policy diffusion, which is a form of interdependent policy-making among jurisdictions at the same or across different levels of governance. To address this gap, we offer a new interpretation and assessment of the extensive adaptation policy literature through a policy diffusion perspective; we pay specific attention to diffusion drivers and barriers, motivations, mechanisms, outputs, and outcomes. We assess the extent to which four motivations and related mechanisms of policy diffusion—interests (linked with learning and competition), rights and duties (tied to coercion), ideology, and recognition (both connected with emulation)—are conceptually and empirically associated with adaptation. We also engage with adaptation policy characteristics, contextual conditions (e.g., problem severity) and different channels of adaptation policy diffusion (e.g., transnational networks). We demonstrate that adaptation policy diffusion can be associated with different mechanisms, yet many of them remain remarkably understudied. So are the effects of adaptation policy diffusion in terms of changes in vulnerability and resilience. We thus identify manifold avenues for future research, and provide insights for practitioners who may hope to leverage diffusion mechanisms to enhance their adaptation efforts.

Wittmer,"This study aims to identify those factors that impact the comprehensiveness of state human trafficking legislation. To do so, we propose independent effects of policy diffusion and the percentage of females in a state legislature. Building on this framework, we then suggest a process of gendered diffusion, whereby female state legislators represent a unique diffusion network for ""women's interest"" issues both within their own legislature, as well as across state networks. Taken together, this paper suggests that, for certain types of new issue areas, the demographic composition of state legislative chambers and the policy diffusion process are conditional on one another. This finding extends the bodies of scholarship concerning descriptive representation and policy diffusion, and presents a novel way to look at the policy-making process.",35,1,1,33,Political science; Law and economics; Representation (politics); State (polity); Legislation; Scholarship; State legislature; Poison control; Public administration; Composition (language); Legislature,,,,,https://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.viewdetails&citationIds[]=citjournalarticle_502100_20 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/jnlpup/v35y2015i01p1-33_00.html https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-public-policy/article/gendered-diffusion-on-gendered-issues-the-case-of-human-trafficking/33C417585B7401D48943975EE5D52C87 http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0143814X1400021X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0143814x1400021x,,10.1017/s0143814x1400021x,2329000928,,0,000-267-571-130-101; 001-193-691-819-349; 003-721-783-119-904; 005-261-328-376-894; 005-503-339-286-965; 006-382-010-653-385; 008-962-279-465-719; 012-309-073-407-444; 013-542-761-437-679; 013-819-100-350-305; 013-847-716-340-39X; 016-903-073-577-854; 017-170-773-275-495; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-518-258-174-447; 018-614-532-733-847; 019-456-406-334-322; 020-180-195-011-961; 021-516-300-262-440; 022-673-142-434-168; 023-512-217-142-645; 029-954-948-455-414; 032-164-929-841-901; 035-131-394-571-869; 035-397-193-037-174; 035-450-919-239-825; 036-226-948-345-088; 036-961-749-635-681; 048-708-689-098-461; 049-483-301-683-165; 049-581-995-590-658; 050-950-951-032-538; 051-094-247-597-858; 052-252-031-072-654; 053-591-896-972-435; 056-413-107-585-107; 057-484-490-124-93X; 058-071-798-060-611; 058-854-154-471-248; 059-323-319-099-936; 062-619-970-937-08X; 063-400-296-712-427; 067-490-686-317-462; 067-668-319-710-778; 067-675-533-535-953; 067-823-150-904-485; 068-905-690-168-04X; 069-708-664-792-571; 073-753-993-648-180; 075-702-171-436-042; 076-240-693-922-091; 077-926-704-396-107; 078-274-650-762-233; 078-544-962-568-939; 078-872-359-988-528; 089-769-913-312-60X; 090-394-845-362-302; 096-591-558-692-908; 096-817-111-334-636; 098-328-427-078-566; 110-870-331-146-686; 111-043-716-864-213; 112-494-266-341-042; 113-508-061-673-503; 114-469-305-545-899; 116-758-122-837-497; 123-158-324-482-940; 130-978-978-055-371; 134-300-624-191-268; 139-186-190-548-754; 145-123-244-493-445; 147-277-167-463-73X; 150-741-371-996-685; 153-461-002-797-51X; 173-256-407-940-663; 196-953-013-748-239,16,false,,

Although Lesotho has followed what has been called the ‘Southern African model’, the introduction of the Old Age Pension was not the result of an explicit process of cross-national policy diffusion. The Child Grant Programme was initially driven by international organizations, but the dynamics were not Southern African, and the Lesotho Government quickly took ownership of the initiative. Unlike in many other parts of Africa, these reforms were not resisted by domestic political elites. The Old Age Pension was championed by the Prime Minister, with support from the Minister of Finance. The reforms were rooted in both socioeconomic changes, with the AIDS pandemic highlighting the inadequacy of extended familial responsibility for the poor, and political change, with the (possibly short-lived) restoration of stable democratic competition in the early 2000s opening the political space for programmatic reform.",,,148,175,Socioeconomic status; Government; Political science; Vulnerability; Cash; Cash transfers; Competition (economics); Economic growth; Democracy; Politics,,,,,https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/wp2016-146.pdf https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/20.500.12413/16334 https://ideas.repec.org/p/unu/wpaper/wp-2016-146.html https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/161529,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198850342.003.0006,,10.1093/oso/9780198850342.003.0006,2609927104,,0,030-990-711-360-285; 037-480-390-236-471; 039-858-395-421-590; 048-943-466-527-37X; 062-044-668-671-503; 071-883-030-669-790; 092-151-188-983-622; 114-297-985-479-03X; 127-345-622-984-737; 149-283-682-351-058; 153-799-564-804-687; 165-714-915-443-538,0,true,cc-by-nc-sa,green

Existing theories of policy learning, policy diffusion and policy convergence assume that transnational communication may lead to domestic policy learning and policy change, but do not suggest general, empirically investigated patterns. Two case studies on the policy of noise abatement around airports and the policy of contaminated land show that different venues in which transnational communication takes place may induce different types of policy change at the national level.French Abstract: Cet article consiste a mettre en evidence comment la communication transnationale peut conduire a l’apprentissage politique national.

Les deux etudes de cas, l’une sur la pollution sonore autour des aeroports, et l’autre sur les terres contaminees illustreront les diverses facons dont la communication transnationale tende a induire differentes formes de changement politique au niveau national.",,,,,Political science; Policy learning; Airport noise; Welfare economics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2481820 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2481820_code1912659.pdf?abstractid=2481820&mirid=1&type=2,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2481820,,,2344864143,,0,018-741-095-147-752; 028-088-843-119-727; 031-687-483-717-856; 078-914-274-844-755; 108-166-013-954-847; 131-057-877-810-606; 163-145-773-402-959,0,false,,

Tentative moves towards telecomms reform began as apartheid started to crumble and sector pressures mounted. Preparing for elections, the ANC was firming up policies, including for the ICT sector, influenced by its own think tank and by global policy diffusion. Spurred by apartheid’s digital divide, the ANC adopted universal access and service as the centrepiece of its ICT sector policy, both within the negotiating process and via civil society formations. A bitter struggle with the apartheid government over the granting of mobile licences led to the imposition of the first universal service obligations. Policy diffusion helped shape post-democracy telecommunications policy, through a highly contested green and White Paper process, leading to legislation containing key, specific universal access and service provisions.",,,65,125,Government; Digital divide; Political science; Negotiation; Legislation; White paper; Public administration; Service (economics); Civil society; Universal design,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43527-1_3 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-43527-1_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43527-1_3,,10.1007/978-3-030-43527-1_3,3034799758,,0,010-743-091-978-004; 022-284-206-041-912; 024-443-615-845-047; 063-783-012-328-564; 073-376-193-393-860; 079-396-293-754-009; 106-947-376-209-968; 111-605-620-428-494; 131-603-606-207-00X; 135-354-854-148-708; 143-269-285-868-88X; 159-151-018-013-980; 169-997-368-069-548; 175-734-005-375-67X; 177-627-013-127-43X; 185-289-362-760-971,0,false,,
165-035-963-524-629,Public sector reform: How the EU budget is used to encourage it. Study,,2016,,,,,,Zareh Asatryan; Friedrich Heinemann; Mustafa Yeter; Eulalia Rubio; David Rinaldi; Fabian Zuleeg,"[This document was requested by the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control. It designated Mr Brian Hayes (MEP) to follow the study.] - The recent European crisis has put the issue of government efficiency high on national policy agendas. Policy measures that result in a reduction of bureaucratic slack or red tape can alleviate the trade-off between consolidation and public service provision. Since 2007 the role of the EU budget in support of administrative reforms has been strengthening, at least in formal terms. However, the extent to which the various EU budgetary instruments have encouraged public administration reforms is unclear. Against the background of the overall European approach towards public administration reforms, this study reviews the current budgetary instruments that directly or indirectly support such reforms, and analyses the coherence, EU added value and complementarities within them. Case studies on four Member States and an analysis of current networks and award initiatives to disseminate best practices complete the study. Based on extensive desk research and a set of semi-structured interviews, the analysis finds a positive but modest impact of the EU budget and existing networks on reform activity. Some of the key recommendations are to improve the consistency of Country Specific Recommendations related to administrative reforms, increase the effectiveness of the Structural Reform Support Programme, and to ensure coherence and complementarity between all EU-funded interventions as well as their monitoring and evaluation processes. As to the role of learning and policy-diffusion, the study recommends to promote focused peer-to-peer exchange among public sector managers, and to develop a more credible evaluation of public sector awards.",,,,,Business; Public sector; Government; Best practice; Public service; Monitoring and evaluation; National Policy; Public administration; Bureaucracy; Added value,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/b/zbw/zewexp/147039.html,https://ideas.repec.org/b/zbw/zewexp/147039.html,,,3121518980,,0,,0,false,,

Henry; Melvin M. Mark,"<jats:p> Although use is a core construct in the field of evaluation, neither the change processes through which evaluation affects attitudes, beliefs, and actions, nor the interim outcomes that lie between the evaluation and its ultimate goal—social betterment—have been sufficiently developed. We draw a number of these change mechanisms, such as justification, persuasion, and policy diffusion, from the social science research literature, and organize them into a framework that has three levels: individual, interpersonal, and collective. We illustrate how these change processes can be linked together to form “pathways” or working hypotheses that link evaluation processes to outcomes that move us along the road toward the goal of social betterment. In addition, we join with Kirkhart (2000) in moving beyond use, to focus our thinking on evaluation influence. Influence, combined with the set of mechanisms and interim outcomes presented here, offers a better way for thinking about, communicating, and adding to the evidence base about the consequences of evaluation and the relationship of evaluation to social betterment. </jats:p>",24,3,293,314,Persuasion; Interim; Construct (python library); Set (abstract data type); Interpersonal communication; Field (mathematics); Social psychology; Psychology; Interpersonal influence; Core (optical fiber); Management science; Computer science; Political science; Telecommunications; Mathematics; Pure mathematics; Law; Economics; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/109821400302400302,,10.1177/109821400302400302,,,0,000-230-129-575-993; 010-737-245-770-716; 019-689-523-878-65X; 019-725-629-062-902; 021-722-353-152-568; 024-950-448-299-208; 026-723-356-510-283; 027-401-899-638-229; 028-661-608-493-873; 029-671-905-945-026; 031-095-965-288-389; 031-300-605-924-441; 037-118-944-065-597; 040-848-353-650-703; 044-418-854-832-156; 044-898-441-161-708; 046-768-753-101-445; 055-727-852-243-903; 059-251-890-545-456; 059-284-453-804-887; 062-913-165-517-020; 069-120-413-103-842; 069-417-875-151-467; 071-068-879-949-141; 073-864-365-670-143; 076-240-693-922-091; 076-305-690-064-532; 081-162-104-566-35X; 081-794-860-403-113; 084-787-681-556-687; 102-692-300-459-058; 103-033-819-236-94X; 110-611-999-072-166; 111-512-766-200-844; 119-740-844-865-303; 132-527-653-081-707; 132-818-590-313-995; 161-659-584-518-878; 193-875-366-706-421; 197-845-936-445-306,107,true,,green

Verglichen wird die Diffusion zweier unterschiedlicher Typen von Umweltzeichensystemen: (1) allgemeinen Umweltzeichensystemen wie dem deutschen Blauen Engel und (2) dem Zertifizierungsprogramm des Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Zu Beginn werden drei unterschiedliche Erklarungen fur Politikkonvergenz dargestellt: Konvergenz durch internationale Regime, regionale Integration und uber globale Politikdiffusion. Letztere gewinnt an Bedeutung aufgrund der Diffusionsprozesse, die durch die Entstehung internationaler, intergouvernementaler und transnationaler Transferinstitutionen ausgelost werden. Es steht zu vermuten, dass staatliche oder halbstaatliche Transferinstitutionen (allgemeine Umweltzeichen) und nichtstaatliche Transferinstitutionen (FSC-Zertifikat) ahnliche Funktionen und Effekte haben. Wir gehen von der Annahme aus, dass Umweltzeichen auch ohne signifikanten staatlichen Einfluss beschlossen werden konnen, weltweite Verbreitung finden und sogar auf nationaler Ebene implementiert werden konnen. Daruber hinaus werden drei Erfolgsfaktoren fur die nationale Performanz von Umweltzeichen identifiziert und analysiert: (1) die Merkmale von Politikinnovationen (Zertifizierungskosten etc.), (2) die okonomischen, gesellschaftlichen und politischinstitutionellen Handlungskapazitaten, (3) die Koexistenz von und der Wettbewerb zwischen verschiedenen Systemen von Umweltzeichen, die zu konvergierenden Standards fuhren konnen.

The main hypothesis of the research is that the South - South cooperation reveals an ""hybridization"" of several forms of policy internationalization: the policy-transfers; the transnational circulation of norms and standards through international organizations; the regionalization and regional integration, especially through civil society and social movements. The research focused in two processes: the characterization of the policy models in Brazil and of the transferred policies in the recipient countries; the identification and profile characterization of the main vectors and brokers of the policy diffusion. The diffusion of the public food purchase model was studied in Colombia, Haiti and Paraguay, the diffusion of territorial policies in Argentina, El Salvador and Uruguay. The results of the study confirm the imbrication and hybridization of these three modalities of dissemination of Brazilian public policies for family farming.

Policy diffusion meets the need of the harmonization principle in which the EU countries must converge towards the same targets. In the light of this, the paper aims to explain the main determinants of the environmental diffusion policy, allowing countries to converge on a common base. We outline the achievements of the environmental policy objectives of the countries by using the Environmental Performance Index, a widely accepted index used at the international level. By using a dyadic dataset on 15 European countries, we highlight the economic and institutional determinants pointing out successes and failures of policies adopted.

Both models contend that decision making occurs laterally as state officials learn from or react to the policy decisions of other elites; the public has a minor role. I offer an additional explanation, the social contagion model, which suggests that state residents react to neighboring policies by changing their aggregate opinions on that policy. If state opinion becomes supportive, state officials respond by enacting similar policies in the home state or risk being ousted from office. Using both individual and aggregate data on antismoking legislation, I find empirical support for the social contagion model. The results reorient theories of policy diffusion to the public and, consequently, open up new avenues for future research.",,,,,Empirical research; Public opinion; Political economy; Emotional contagion; Political science; State (polity); Legislation; Aggregate data; Minor (academic); Policy decision; Public relations,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/S0022381611001241,https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/S0022381611001241,,,475328449,,0,,0,false,,

Regional Emulation and the Design of Transparency Policies,2013-11-05,2013,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Daniel Berliner,"How do countries make policy in an uncertain world? Do policymakers look inward, rationally designing policies to fit domestic interests, ideas, and institutions? Or do they look outward, imitating policy elements from other countries? And if the latter, where do they look? Focusing on the specific policy area of Freedom of Information laws, I argue that regional emulation plays an important role in shaping policy design. Policymakers face substantial uncertainty over the consequences of different design choices, and so emulate other countries as policy models. I further argue that, due to availability bias, countries in the same region serve as the most important such models. After reviewing numerous examples of such emulation, I model the policy similarity between 4,096 pairs of countries, and find that countries in the same region, or more geographically proximate, tend to have more similar laws than other country-pairs. These results are robust to different categorizations of region, fixed effects capturing country-specific features, and testing against alternative forms of emulation as well as alternative diffusion mechanisms of competition, coercion, conditionality, and learning. This approach also highlights the diffusion of policy design, as opposed to adoption, as an important future direction for policy diffusion research.",55,,28,,Public economics; Emulation; Political science; Freedom of information; Coercion; Similarity (psychology); Face (sociological concept); Competition (economics); Conditionality; Transparency (graphic),,,,,https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/37347 http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000002838/WP_55_Berliner.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:erp:kfgxxx:p0055 http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/kfgeu/kfgwp/wpseries/WorkingPaperKFG_55.pdf https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/document/37347/1/ssoar-2013-berliner-Follow_your_Neighbor_Regional_Emulation.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/p/erp/kfgxxx/p0055.html https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/v/transformeurope/publications/working_paper/WP_55_Berliner.pdf?1383651527,https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/37347,,,2251967090,,0,002-783-208-148-386; 003-412-189-797-295; 003-528-113-635-892; 008-451-054-330-616; 010-003-191-094-552; 017-010-933-750-388; 017-928-849-887-225; 026-897-684-454-102; 027-085-197-030-700; 027-152-711-597-919; 027-827-119-143-849; 028-165-387-722-560; 028-933-497-480-442; 033-085-475-899-252; 034-509-551-210-676; 035-261-961-935-32X; 035-388-056-843-087; 037-081-137-182-694; 042-083-382-402-275; 048-084-385-775-90X; 049-662-861-806-139; 053-044-883-605-676; 067-121-006-432-261; 071-213-792-800-940; 071-602-898-127-378; 076-701-138-949-462; 077-926-704-396-107; 077-945-151-328-246; 078-249-789-490-901; 080-371-361-498-348; 081-166-628-807-722; 097-419-955-788-796; 099-956-410-004-10X; 109-846-350-888-372; 117-677-347-760-402; 119-306-789-972-859; 119-843-361-228-141; 131-076-765-815-326; 137-849-796-205-184; 163-637-734-144-951; 195-771-026-706-448,4,false,,

The information collected serves to check to what extent participatory budgeting as practiced in the countries involved presents a real attempt to change municipal budgets toward addressing the needs of marginalized groups and to improve decision-making based on local democracy and participation, or whether these processes as such are to be judged to be more important than any output and outcomes. All in all, the practices of PB as they evolved in European countries out of the innovative original as developed in Porto Alegre in the 1990s can be seen neither as a process of policy diffusion nor as a process of policy mimesis. The terminology of participatory budgeting remained, but the goals and tools to achieve the goals resulted only in marginal changes in the status quo in municipalities in European countries practicing participatory budgeting, instead of resulting in radical changes to increase spending in favor of marginalized groups. Participatory budgeting in selected European countries is far away from the level of “best practice” in which local democracy and participation are promoted. However, it is also not possible to conclude that all experiences are just “trivial pursuits”.</jats:p>",,,287,313,Political science; Participatory budgeting; Public administration,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-79930-4_15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-79930-4_15,,10.1007/978-3-030-79930-4_15,3215122739,,0,004-253-345-511-780; 011-526-884-657-097; 011-556-545-629-11X; 024-371-208-430-792; 025-398-122-525-586; 050-274-654-059-514; 052-723-818-069-06X; 071-598-730-444-581; 106-314-082-808-551; 163-637-734-144-951,4,true,cc-by,hybrid

Haider-Markel,"Within the current context of state governments searching for roles in the response to terrorism, we explore the nature of state policy response to recent domestic threats to government operations. We employ a general model of state diffusion of innovative policies in an effort to understand state adoption of laws against the use of frivolous liens. The use of such liens by right-wing Patriot groups grew in the 1990s, leading us to focus on key issues related to policy diffusion—the extent of the problem or threat, and the characteristics of regional response. To test specific hypotheses we use Event History Analysis on a state-level dataset from 1995 to 1999. Our results suggest that state adoption of lien laws is mostly driven by regional forces, including the regional threat posed by Patriot groups and the adoption of lien laws by other states in the region, rather than national forces or factors internal to a state.

This pattern is largely a result of policy diffusion. In the absence of formal obligations, regulatory instruments that have been communicated internationally and were already being practiced elsewhere were voluntarily emulated and adopted by policy makers. While the international promotion of regulatory instruments often facilitated their diffusion, the instruments’ characteristics determined the extent and speed by which regulatory instruments spread across countries. The voluntary adoption of regulatory instruments cannot be exclusively explained by the rational motivation of policy makers to improve effectiveness. In addition, they were motivated by concerns of legitimacy and perceived pressure to conform with international norms.",598,1,146,167,Public economics; Economics; Regulatory competition; Making-of; Harmonization; Environmental policy; Legitimacy; Promotion (rank); Economic system,,,,,https://ann.sagepub.com/content/598/1/146.abstract https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716204272355 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716204272355 http://eiop.or.at/eiop/pdf/2004-021.pdf https://ciencia.iscte-iul.pt/id/ci-pub-29853,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002716204272355,,10.1177/0002716204272355,2139714143,,0,002-071-895-309-421; 004-870-676-018-804; 008-631-552-749-08X; 010-606-186-820-276; 017-010-933-750-388; 019-071-532-556-877; 028-304-400-289-974; 033-546-466-581-081; 038-161-219-002-382; 039-318-000-420-191; 048-084-385-775-90X; 048-846-133-812-979; 061-328-441-274-907; 062-970-305-189-649; 063-149-938-949-77X; 067-079-851-978-708; 074-638-783-785-569; 074-796-221-935-91X; 075-620-466-978-528; 088-993-237-313-315; 089-069-980-374-029; 091-287-290-060-61X; 092-858-750-165-82X; 094-387-586-690-669; 097-146-280-230-557; 105-834-617-139-124; 117-677-347-760-402; 119-921-324-820-905; 120-262-336-479-651; 125-268-617-755-543; 126-759-950-860-681; 135-799-130-941-366; 143-437-369-313-590; 155-836-463-720-671; 156-165-947-011-451; 163-637-734-144-951; 182-561-697-687-850,138,false,,

172-613-016-043-558,Norms and Social Hierarchies : Understanding International Policy Diffusion 'From Below,,2010,,,,,,Ann Towns,"This article aims to rethink the operation of norms in international policy diffusion. Norms do not simply standardize state behaviors, as is conventionally argued; norms also draw on and set up hierarchical social orders among states. Through a conceptual rethinking we gain a better understanding of where—among which states—new policies may first emerge: social hierarchies create incentives for new policies to develop at the margins of international society so that policies may diffuse “from below.” We also get a better grasp of how policy advocates frame the appropriateness or benefits of a new state practice: they must frame policy demands in terms of the international standing and rank of the targeted state. This article's empirical aspiration is to use these insights to help account for the international policy diffusion of legal sex quotas, a policy to increase the level of female legislators that developed first among “developing” states rather than among the so-called core of international society. By pointing to the link between norms and social hierarchy, the article helps account for policy diffusion “from below.”",,,,,Rank (computer programming); Frame (artificial intelligence); Set (psychology); Political science; Law and economics; Core (game theory); As is; State (polity); Incentive; Social science; Social stratification,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:392665 http://hv.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:392665,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:392665,,,2178242096,,0,,0,false,,

The latest wave of regionalism in the form of mega-regional trade partnerships between countries with major shares of the world economy occurred in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09. The most systematically important mega-FTAs included the Trans-Pacific Partnership led by the United States (US), the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union (EU) and the US. ; Drawing on policy diffusion and competitive regionalism literatures, Xianbai Ji develops an innovative model of competitive spill-over to uncover the historical and contemporary sources of mega-regionalism resulting from a temporal clustering of mega-FTA initiatives from great powers. In the book, mega-FTA is conceptualised as an instrument of geo-economic competition between the US, China, and the EU. Each aspired to leverage its mega-FTA to gain an edge over its rivals in economic, geopolitical, and legal terms. Through a mix-method research strategy involving computable general equilibrium modelling, game theory, desk research, and perception survey, Ji generates an impressive chorus of quantitative, qualitative, and perceptual data demonstrating that the rise of mega-regionalism was driven by the multidimensional competition between the US, China, and the EU over international economic benefits, geopolitical influence, and the authority to write rules governing emerging trade issues. ; This book will attract academics, think tankers, practitioners, and postgraduate students interested in regionalism, international trade, international political economy, applied trade policy analysis, great power competition, geo-economics, and international relations.",,,,,Commercial policy; International trade; Political science; World economy; Great power; Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; European union; International political economy; International relations; Regionalism (international relations),,,,,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003177067/mega-regionalism-great-power-geo-economic-competition-xianbai-ji,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003177067/mega-regionalism-great-power-geo-economic-competition-xianbai-ji,,,3189309233,,0,,0,false,,

174-211-397-538-992,Public morals in private hands? : a study into the evolving path of farm animal welfare governance,,2015,,,,,,C. Toschi Maciel,"Executive summary The advancement of regulatory instruments providing for farm animal welfare measures has been marked by various political and regulatory constraints in both domestic and international settings.In an attempt to overcome some of these constraints, a number of innovative governance arrangements have been developed over the two last decades, such as the use of private standards.This thesis offers a critical assessment on how and to what extent the policy field of farm animals welfare has been affected by these innovative developments. The assessment provided in this thesis resulted from four independent (but inter-related) studies. The first study consisted of a theoretical inquiry into the engagement of non-state actors in farm animal welfare policy making in Europe. This study sought to establish the extent to which the changes observed in Europe, specifically in the Netherlands, are consistentwith political modernization theory. This study confirmed that the engagement of non-state actors in farm animal welfare policy-makingin Europe corresponds to themodernization of governance practices, where a new collation of actors, policy discourses and rules come to the fore. The second study consisted of an empirical investigation ofthe rise of farm animal welfare governance in Brazil. The main objective of this study was to gain insight into a development that remains largely unexplored in the current social science literature, that is, into the factors triggering policy change related to animal protection in developing countries. Data collected through 36 semi-structured interviews amongdifferent groups of Brazilian stakeholders suggested that the main factors leading to the rise of animal welfare governance in Brazil were related to Europe and the World OrganisationforAnimal Health (OIE). The insights gained fromthis exploratory empirical study helped produce an analytical framework for assessing how farm animal welfare measures spread across jurisdictions, which is further elaborated in the third phase of this doctoral research. Accordingly, in the third study, an empirical and theoretical examination ofanimal welfare governance in the European Union-Brazildyad is performed with the objective of assessing theactors and mechanisms currently in place to advance farm animal welfare in bilateral and international relations. Several initiatives have been identified as useful in coordinating animal welfare measures between theEU and Brazil. The study nonetheless found that initiatives based on policy diffusion mechanisms were the most prominent. The fourth study entailed a legal analysis ofthe relationship between the regulatory framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the advancement of animal welfare measures through private standards. The objective of this study was to determine the possibility thatprivate standards fall within the scope of WTO Member States’ obligations listedin Article 13 of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (SPS). For that purpose, three fundamental factorsfor claims of breaches of Article 13 to be pursuedwere examined: (i) the applicability of the SPS Agreement to farm animal welfare measures; (ii) the scope of the term ‘non-governmental entities’; and (iii) the existence of factual evidence that a WTO Member has not taken reasonable measures to ensure that SPS disciplines are observed by non-governmental entities or that a WTO Member has encouraged non-governmental entities or have relied upon the services of non-governmental entities that are not SPScompliant. The conclusion drawn from this examination is that convincing legal arguments and factual evidence exist to pursue WTO disputes over the use of private farm animal welfare standards. Based on all the above findings, the overall assessment of this thesis regarding the evolving path of farm animal welfare governance is four-fold.First, the policy field of farm animal welfare has significantly advanced in and between Europe and Brazil through a variety of non-legislative instruments, such as intergovernmental technical cooperation, capacity building programmes and private standards. Second, the political and regulatory implications of this research regarding the use of private standards in animal welfare indicate that a cautious approach to the use of this policy instrument is required. Third, the policy field of animal welfare has greatly benefited from the entry of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), especially in engaging governments and industries in developing countriesin this area. Finally, a reverse shift (that is, a shift away from private governance and towards public governance) is likely to occur as the path of farm animal welfare policy evolves internationally.",,,,,Public economics; Welfare; Public policy; Empirical research; Political science; Capacity building; Executive summary; European union; Corporate governance; Animal welfare,,,,,http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/488308 http://edepot.wur.nl/343363 https://research.wur.nl/en/publications/public-morals-in-private-hands-a-study-into-the-evolving-path-of- https://edepot.wur.nl/343363 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F488308,http://edepot.wur.nl/343363,,,2591743446,,0,,1,false,,

Using a systematic review and meta-analysis, this study presents the most comprehensive analysis to date of how policy innovation flows state-to-state and the average effects of commonly used variables in the study of policy diffusion (for example, neighbour adoptions, ideological distance between states and legislative professionalism). Additionally, heterogeneity in these effects is examined across regulatory, morality and governance policy types. The study not only estimates these weighted-average effects, but it also illuminates important biases in policy diffusion research.

175-571-290-512-691,Autonomy and Isomorphism: The Unfulfilled Promise of Structural Autonomy in American State Constitutions,,2014,,,,,,James A. Gardner,"In the American system of federalism, states have almost complete freedom to adopt institutions and practices of internal self-governance that they find best-suited to the needs and preferences of their citizens. Nevertheless, states have not availed themselves of these opportunities: the structural provisions of state constitutions tend to converge strongly with one another and with the U.S. Constitution. This paper examines two important periods of such convergence: the period from 1776 through the first few decades of the nineteenth century, when states were inventing institutions of democratic governance and representation; and the period following the Supreme Court’s one person, one vote decisions in the early 1960s, when the Court’s destruction of the existing constitutional model created an important opportunity for states to experiment with alternative forms of legislative representation. In the first period, initial innovation and diversity were followed quickly by convergence and isomorphism; and in the second period, no burst of innovation occurred at all. After reviewing studies of institutional isomorphism and policy diffusion from other fields, the paper concludes that the facts best fit explanations based on the resort by constitutional drafters to well-known patterns of non-rational decision making such as “availability” and “anchoring” heuristics. American state constitutions thus likely display little diversity in their structural provisions not because prevailing models have proven superior to the alternatives, but because imitating the choices of seemingly similar entities is a common way to dispatch cognitively challenging tasks.",60,,31,67,Political science; Law and economics; Constitution; State (polity); Supreme court; Diversity (business); Federalism; Isomorphism (sociology); Autonomy; Legislature,,,,,https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/articles/220/ https://works.bepress.com/james-gardner/13/ https://works.bepress.com/james-gardner/13/download/,https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/articles/220/,,,3124681375,,0,,1,false,,

Nonetheless, it is; possible to study the influence of the OMC at ideational level. This study aims; to do this for the Youth OMC. Against the background of the creation of; epistemic community and the theory of discursive diffusion a comparative; discourse analysis is conducted between the EU’s Youth OMC and Dutch youth; policies. The discourse analysis for both levels focuses on youth; (un)employment measures, in particular those addressing young people who are; neither in employment, education or training (NEET). The study finds that in; case of The Netherlands, the outcome of the analysis gives a mixed result on; the influence of the Youth OMC. In terms of ideas and sort of measures the; Youth OMC and Dutch youth policies are remarkable similar, especially; concerning measures serving the NEETs needs, however, these have been developed; at different moments in time. Overall The Netherlands seems to run ahead of the; EU, and as such possibly influenced the Youth OMC (bottom-up policy diffusion).; In one period of time (2004 – 2009) though, the Youth OMC and Dutch policies appear; to be synchronous.",,,,,Political science; Epistemic community; Open method of coordination; Causal relations; Member states; Public administration; Corporate governance; Discourse analysis,,,,,https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/67869/ https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A2973854/view,https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/67869/,,,2924856890,,0,,0,false,,

However, not every state policy reaches the national level. Previous work has suggested that state-level policies are more likely to become national policies depending on their geographic origin, their category of legislation, or some characteristic of their initiating states, such as wealth, urbanicity, or ideological liberalism. Here, we tested these hypotheses by divorcing the set of traits from the states' identities and building predictive forecasting models of state policies becoming national policies. Using a large, longitudinal data set of state level policies and their traits, we train models to predict (i) whether policies become national policy, and (ii) how many states must pass a given policy before it becomes national. Using these models as components, we then develop a logistic growth model to forecast when a currently spreading state-level policy is likely to pass at the national level. Our results indicate that traits of initiating states are not systematically correlated with becoming national policy and they predict neither how many states must enact a policy before it becomes national nor whether it ultimately becomes a national law. In contrast, the cumulative number of state-level adoptions of a policy is reasonably predictive of when a policy becomes national. For the policies of same sex marriage and methamphetamine precursor laws, we investigate how well the logistic growth model could forecast the probable time horizon for true national action. We close with a data-driven forecast of when marijuana legalization and ""stand your ground"" laws will become national policy.",,,,,Public economics; Liberalism (international relations); Economics; Work (electrical); Logistic function; State (polity); Federal law; Legislation; National Policy; Time horizon,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08988 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181008988C/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08988 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1810.html#abs-1810-08988,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08988,,,2895818652,,0,003-592-471-884-916; 005-692-270-875-15X; 015-765-163-150-580; 018-454-798-334-448; 023-672-511-213-267; 036-961-749-635-681; 037-306-656-996-774; 039-664-709-632-96X; 050-082-471-457-812; 058-046-685-654-371; 059-274-660-526-403; 071-361-180-414-699; 076-240-693-922-091; 096-548-920-809-272; 101-127-387-013-017; 101-488-954-100-242; 106-623-190-870-634; 174-768-369-809-642; 176-503-345-697-964,0,true,,

177-437-787-318-339,The diffusion of competition law in Africa: theoretical perspectives on the policy transfer process,2017-08-28,2017,dissertation,,,,,Azza Anwar Ahmed Raslan,"This thesis uses policy diffusion theories as the theoretical framework for the study of the proliferation of competition laws in Africa. By forming synergies with the diffusion literature, the thesis identifies the main transfer agents and presents a typology of competition law based on its objectives. Since the 1990s, Africa has witnessed an exponential increase in the number of jurisdictions adopting competition law. In addition to facing fundamental obstacles such as weak rule of law and institutions, competition law adoption and enforcement in Africa have to balance a number of different, and sometimes conflicting, policies. The pursuit of economic growth through integration into the world economy has led to convergence with an “economic welfare based model” of competition law. At the same time, the desire to meet social obligations, such as the protection of disadvantaged groups and developmental needs, has led to the incorporation of broader policy objectives in competition law, thereby introducing divergence from the said model. One area where this divergence features prominently is merger control, where plurality of objectives (economic welfare and non-economic welfare) are considered and weighed against each other. This increases the complexity of conducting cross-border mergers and creates tension between the different legal systems. The original contribution of this thesis is in bringing together two sets of literature, namely diffusion, and competition law. It provides a statistical and systematic analysis of competition law transfer to Africa, which is also absent from the literature. It empirically traces the transfer process and policy objectives of these laws, focusing on South Africa as the leading jurisdiction in this respect. It looks into how the South African model has influenced other laws in Africa, and the challenges arising from this. Its aim is to engage academia in a critical examination of this model, assist policymakers in making informed policy choices, and benefit practitioners in understanding how merger analysis functions in this regard.",,,,,Economics; Policy transfer; Competition law; Rule of law; Jurisdiction; World economy; Enforcement; Competition (economics); Merger control; Economic system,,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.746760 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1571008/,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.746760,,,2803704546,,0,,0,false,,

Miller; Brian Richard,"Since the first U.S. state adopted the Research and Development (R&D) tax credit in the early 1980s, the policy has spread to most of the other states. The diffusion continues with numerous modifications and enhancements to the basic R&D tax credit. This study examines the diffusion of the R&D investment tax credit using event history analysis supported by qualitative research. The conclusions of the research are that the R&D tax credit is an economic development approach associated with an existing manufacturing base and implementation is aided by political factors. Adjacent state competition does not appear to lead toward adoption. Applying these findings to the current literature on the effectiveness of the state R&D tax credits highlights the need for thorough policy evaluation before the adoption of tax credits as part of an economic development program.",42,1,22,35,Public economics; Value-added tax; Tax credit; Economics; Double taxation; Tax avoidance; Tax reform; Ad valorem tax; Credit history; Financial system; State income tax,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/41057529 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0160323x10364748 https://slg.sagepub.com/content/42/1/22.abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0160323x10364748,,10.1177/0160323x10364748,2326582088,,0,001-328-701-270-077; 002-338-444-932-433; 003-592-471-884-916; 007-744-621-645-458; 010-032-004-858-813; 013-739-423-912-464; 015-591-021-271-179; 018-454-798-334-448; 027-216-588-100-494; 028-357-177-606-816; 030-893-783-652-530; 031-370-875-926-467; 033-969-989-312-301; 038-134-219-419-299; 038-780-639-971-780; 038-972-931-927-37X; 046-974-325-252-690; 047-859-864-329-821; 053-039-612-783-239; 062-687-458-009-705; 064-463-299-403-755; 072-192-750-462-767; 074-224-748-234-526; 075-046-752-556-824; 076-240-693-922-091; 084-954-596-675-708; 085-835-075-480-379; 091-281-750-062-142; 093-421-028-537-678; 096-460-080-567-859; 097-416-968-699-086; 108-155-570-782-626; 110-122-128-968-795; 126-624-049-812-443; 145-260-087-070-588; 146-927-092-118-805; 153-653-915-439-385; 161-886-277-003-313; 183-847-505-313-097; 195-817-030-033-953,32,false,,

Den politiska översättningen av metadonbehandling och husläkare i Sverige,,2003,journal article,Lund political studies,04600037,,,Björn Johnson,"This thesis discusses an alternative to the conventional policy diffusion approach, i.e. the social constructivist translation perspective. Within the translation perspective, policy diffusion is defined as a process where meaning is constructed by temporally and spatially disembedding policy ideas from their previous context and using them as models for policy change in a new context. This brings attention to the importance of a deepened problematization of the policy concept, the actor-dependent character of translation, and to the fact that translation processes are always tied to a local context. Translation should be seen as open, continuous processes that never take place independently of the societal distribution of power.; ; In the thesis a distinction is made between political and practical translation. Political translation processes takes place at field level in connection with authoritative decision-making, and are a question of how policy ideas are adapted to the given local political context. This discussion is followed by the creation of an analytical framework for the study of political translation. The framework combines concepts from Kingdon’s version of the garbage-can model with concepts from neo-institutional theories.; ; The functioning of the political translation framework is empirically illustrated by way of two case studies. The first study traces the Swedish methadone issue, from the introduction of the methadone maintenance treatment in 1966 to the end of 1980s when this form of treatment gained wider acceptance. The second study covers the Swedish family doctor issue, from the launch of the proposal by the Swedish Liberal Party in the election campaign of 1976 to the abolition of the Family Doctor Act in 1995.",130,130,,,Epistemology;

Examining Inter-County Anti-Smoking Laws in the State of Missouri",2014-09-22,2014,journal article,Public Administration Quarterly,07349149,,,Joshua L. Mitchell; null La Shonda M. Stewart,"INTRODUCTION Recent research in policy diffusion examines how policies diffuse among local governments, or from local governments to states (Godwin and Schroedel 2000, Rincke 2007, Swarts 2011, Shipan and Volden 2006). This allows scholars to both understand and distinguish between specific theories of diffusion. Studies have focused on diffusion from cities to states (e.g. Shipan and Volden 2008), among cities (Godwin and Schroedel 2000), between school districts (Rincke 2007) or from county to county indirectly (Bouche' and Volden 2011). (5) However, no studies have examined multiple theories of policy diffusion directly between counties. (6) Counties are creatures of the state, as well as important and underexplored policy laboratories. Examining diffusion at the county level can enhance researchers' understandings of federalism and intergovernmental relations, how counties react to the policies of one another, and the policy dynamics of local governments in home rule states. (7) Therefore, in this article this gap in the literature is addressed by examining the diffusion of antismoking laws among counties in Missouri. This study examines Missouri because of its demographic, economic, and political similarities to other states. The population density and growth rate of Missouri is similar to other states; it is located in the Midwest, bordered by seven other states; and has 114 counties (U.S. Census Bureau 2012). (8) Besides Missouri's demographic similarities to states, there are also no statewide restrictions on smoking, which allows for the examination of a greater frequency of anti-smoking laws over time. Also, local governments have discretion in the implementation of anti-smoking laws. There have been no national efforts to create legislation to restrict smoking, but in the last few decades, 25 states (including the District of Columbia) have taken measures to regulate smoking (Center for Disease Control 2011). The other 25 states (including Missouri) have no statewide regulations, but have local governments implementing smoking restrictions. While studies have examined the diffusion of health policies across U.S. states (Carter and LaPlant 1997, Shipan and Volden 2006), only Shipan and Volden (2008) have examined multiple theories that could explain the diffusion of health policies among cities (Shipan and Volden 2008). In this study, we look at diffusion directly among counties (9) in order to explain the mechanisms of county-level diffusion. Studying local policy diffusion and its respective mechanisms is important to understanding the implications of the devolution of policies from states to local governments (Shipan and Volden 2008). County-level data were collected for counties in Missouri from the years 2004-2010. A negative binomial regression was used to test three diffusion theories: emulation, social learning, and economic competition. (10) We also test the temporal and conditional hypotheses of each of these theories. In addition, multiple internal control variables (population, retail sales, federal spending, median income, the county's lung cancer rate, the percentage of county smoking regulation support, and county vote returns) were analyzed to determine their impact on smoking regulations. The next section begins with a literature review of the three theories used to examine smoking regulations. Second, the research methodology is discussed, followed by an analyses of the multiple models used in this study. Finally, the findings are presented and discussed along with the implications of this study. LITERATURE REVIEW Due to the medical and social costs to individuals who consume tobacco products, its usage is often regulated (McGrew 2003, Townsend 1996). Both state and local governments share responsibility for levying taxes on tobacco use (Shipan and Volden 2006). Smoking regulations in local governments often involve restricting smoking in restaurants or establishments that serve alcohol, sales or transaction regulations, restricting smoking in public buildings or other establishments, or a combination of these. …",38,3,317,,Economics; Devolution; Law; Legislation; Discretion; Townsend; Median income; Population; Federalism; Home rule,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3413212131/emulation-learning-or-competition-examining-inter-county,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3413212131/emulation-learning-or-competition-examining-inter-county,,,1559670685,,0,002-557-636-257-591; 015-591-021-271-179; 016-088-247-599-087; 018-454-798-334-448; 018-507-965-164-922; 028-233-073-308-991; 034-703-154-170-999; 058-071-798-060-611; 068-264-304-760-006; 068-905-690-168-04X; 073-014-201-416-869; 076-240-693-922-091; 079-416-691-248-326; 080-092-727-981-19X; 082-651-073-463-924; 084-154-879-306-982; 088-919-425-365-248; 106-352-974-752-749; 140-882-984-483-643; 155-580-858-393-517,8,false,,
188-916-671-073-496,The analysis of mutual learning processes in the European employment strategy: a social constructivist approach,,2005,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Peter Nedergaard,"The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the recent debate in the political science literature on analytical approaches to learning, which has gradually developed in a direction of being less and less individualistic. Section 3 follows up on this development and introduces a social constructivist approach to learning that redefines learning as changes in language-constituted relations to others. In section 4 this argument is elaborated into a model for mutual learning. Section 5 contains a qualitative analysis of the organisation of the EES in practice with regard to the possibilities of policy diffusion of the EES learning processes as predicted in the model in section 4. Section 6 deals with the conflictual views on the size and character of the learning processes of the EES in recent studies and proposes a new methodological path to investigate the mutual learning processes based upon a social constructivist approach. Section 7 is the conclusion of the article which sums up the examination of the both the various approaches to learning analysed in the paper and the evaluation of the possibilities of policy diffusion resulting from the learning processes.",,,,,Epistemology; Individualism; Political science; Constructivist teaching methods; European Employment Strategy; Section (archaeology); Argument; Management science; Social learning; Social constructivism; Learning sciences,,,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/33105/ http://nedergaard.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/wp2005-004_experiences_in_the_european_union_and_among_nordic_countries.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pra:mprapa:33105 https://nedergaard.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/wp2005-004_experiences_in_the_european_union_and_among_nordic_countries.pdf,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/33105/,,,1682929974,,0,014-318-963-613-466; 018-924-132-837-114; 036-755-195-934-817; 041-199-192-915-81X; 045-895-178-243-855; 057-136-803-879-17X; 061-054-885-411-161; 062-945-680-427-261; 063-958-962-471-147; 073-653-285-270-967; 080-171-581-481-170; 087-221-750-932-970; 098-161-671-368-184; 102-753-382-335-337; 106-459-793-238-089; 113-439-820-478-519; 185-913-478-967-225,3,false,,

Case studies employing legislative transcripts reveal the debates on mandate legislation differed on three points of comparison: the specifics of the legislation, the qualities of the sponsors, and the legislative outcomes. In Illinois, the mandate legislation included an IVF component, the sponsor was a Democrat, and the legislature passed the bill. In Nebraska, the mandate legislation did not include IVF, the sponsor was a Republican, and the legislature rejected the bill. What seems to have been an important difference was the nature of the proposed policy innovation. In Illinois, the mandate legislation included coverage for IVF, and that brought a morality theme to the debate. In Nebraska, IVF and other morally troublesome assisted reproductive technologies were left out of the legislation by the sponsor's design. Thus the debate had a decidedly more regulatory flavor. The paper places these results in an epidemiological framework and illustrates how qualitative investigation of the characteristics of policies, when conceived of as viruses, and of policy entrepreneurs and interest groups, when conceived of as vectors, can aid our understanding of policy diffusion.",,,,,Political science; Law; Morality; Mandate; Legislation; Reproductive technology; Insurance coverage; Regulatory policy; Public administration; Legislature,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1450925 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1462736_code1321276.pdf?abstractid=1450925&mirid=1,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1450925,,,1558973985,,0,017-124-972-138-138; 023-325-263-396-562; 024-854-593-196-686; 029-821-555-489-577; 036-639-474-483-459; 042-694-202-497-987; 051-489-238-047-586; 070-324-778-697-68X; 079-683-658-387-785; 083-838-589-683-473; 089-685-210-444-392; 093-435-225-584-649; 099-385-342-011-423; 116-574-261-437-956; 122-272-518-488-77X; 137-133-162-082-000; 180-572-031-869-798,1,false,,

Contrary to the usual setting with simultaneous decision making we consider the impact of sequential decision making: In the first step the domestic government introduces an emission tax, in the second step policy diffusion occurs with a certain probability and in the third step the firms decide on output quantities. Within this framework we analyze how the prospect of policy diffusion, motivated by a higher damage parameter in the domestic country, influences the optimal domestic emission tax. We show that if the damage parameter in the foreign country is sufficiently high policy diffusion will occur which leads to higher tax rates and higher welfare compared to the equilibrium resulting from simultaneous decision making. Moreover, we show that an increase in the domestic tax rate also increases the probability that the foreign country adopts the tax policy.",,,,,Welfare; Diffusion (business); Government; Economics; Microeconomics; Tax policy; Tax rate; Sequential decision; Emission tax; Probabilistic logic,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:aug:augsbe:0318 https://ideas.repec.org/p/aug/augsbe/0318.html,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:aug:augsbe:0318,,,3125872738,,0,,0,false,,

192-511-098-153-90X,Policy Diffusion in A Social Security Reform: A Study Case of the National Social Security System in Indonesia,,2017,,,,,,Citamia Ihsana Subekti,"There has been an ongoing debate in the study of diffusion in policy making processes. Acharya (2009) believes that economic crisis was one of the reasons why the phenomenon of diffusion of foreign norms succeeds in Asian countries. It is argued that those norms replacing or assimilated to local ones could increase national self-strengthening (Acharya 2009). Furthermore, he believes that there is the possibility of diffusion because of the characteristic of political actors in those countries, which are active interpreters of external values. However, Berman (2001) states that there are many other conditions that lead to it such as political structures/institutions and ideologies, which are formed historically and by construction. This research thesis thus wants to see how international norms have been diffused and influenced the policy making process in Indonesia, with the study case: the role of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the development of the Law of National Social Security System (UU SJSN). Using a constructivist approach with policy diffusion theory and mixed methods, the research finds that there was a dominant influence by some of the SJSN team members and there are four mechanisms of policy diffusion that happened in the process of policy making. These are socialization/persuasion, learning, soft coercion, and domestic fit.

The research focused in two processes: the characterization of the policy models in Brazil and the transferred policies in the recipient countries; the identification and profile characterization of the main vectors and brokers of the policy diffusion. The diffusion of the public food purchase model refers to the cases of Colombia, Haiti and Paraguay and the diffusion of territorial policies refers to Argentina, El Salvador, and Uruguay. The results of the study confirm the imbrication and hybridization of these three modalities of dissemination of Brazilian public policies for family farming.

Richard Gold,"Why do some countries adopt exogenous rules into their domestic law when those laws do not align with the country’s specific interests? This article draws on the policy diffusion literature to identify four causal mechanisms that are hypothesized to give rise to those transplants in the case of asymmetric interests. While the literature presents these mechanisms independently, this article argues that each works in combination with the others to facilitate legal transplantation. The empirical demonstration is based on a quantitative analysis of legal transplants in the field of intellectual property (IP), and incorporates an original index of IP protection in 121 developing countries over 14 years. Our results suggest that, while one mechanism – coercion – is instrumental in initiating the transplantation process, it fades over time and is largely supplanted by three others: contractualization, socialization and regulatory competition acting in a mutually supportive manner. This article concludes with a plea for theoretical eclecticism, acknowledging multi-causality and context-conditionality. Any comprehensive explanation of legal transplantation must include the identification of mutual reinforcement between causal mechanisms, rather than simply ranking their relative contributions.",,,,,Eclecticism; Political science; Law and economics; Regulatory competition; Quantitative analysis (finance); Plea; Transplantation; Intellectual property; Developing country; Municipal law,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ulb:ulbeco:2013/149496,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ulb:ulbeco:2013/149496,,,3021126664,,0,,0,false,,
196-818-064-415-539,Globalization and the diffusion of gender policy reforms in Latin America,,2008,dissertation,,,,,Christiane Gernet,"In the 1990s, Latin American countries introduced similar national gender equality policy reforms. The key policy areas in which this convergence took place were the criminalization of domestic violence, the introduction of state agencies for women, and the incorporation into law of candidate gender quotas for national parliamentary elections. This thesis evaluates the explanations offered in the existing literature, including both national and international level analyses that could explain this process of policy convergence.; ; The thesis uses a combination of methodological approaches drawn from the policy diffusion and policy transfer literatures. Drawing on the existing literature a number of hypotheses are constructed which could explain the observed pattern of policy change. These include: the number of women in parliament; the level of democracy; the level of economic development; measures of women's education; fertility rates; the strength of the national women's movement; the existence of relevant international norms; the state's involvement in transnational networks; the state's record of similar policy reform; and the degree of geographical proximity to earlier adopters of reforms. The macro study operationalises the external and internal independent variables that emerge from the hypotheses to facilitate an event history analysis. Drawing on the findings of the macro study a case study analysis was carried out on the reform of domestic violence legislation, and the failure to introduce candidate gender quotas in Chile.; ; The macro study confirms the importance of international norms and transnational networks as significant factors in the policy diffusion across the region, and confirms that international norms were mediated by domestic factors including the strength of the local women's movement, domestic political culture and institutional structures. Surprisingly, in contrast to dominant views in the literature, the macro study indicated that the level of economic development, the level of democracy or the status of women were not significant factors in explaining the adoption of reforms. In fact, the criminalisation of domestic violence was negatively correlated to women's status. The case studies confirmed the findings of the macro study at the micro level, in an analysis of; Chile's adoption of laws criminalising domestic violence, and its rejection of gender quotas.; ; The wave of gender equality policy reform in Latin America coincided with an increased global interest in women's rights, and the emergence of a global gender equality regime. The thesis demonstrates that the global diffusion of gender equality ideas is a feature of the conditions of national policy-making in a globalizing world.",,,,,Latin Americans; Political science; Globalization; Policy transfer; Legislation; Criminalization; Development economics; Economic growth; Domestic violence; Democracy; Political culture,,,,,http://doras.dcu.ie/17028/,http://doras.dcu.ie/17028/,,,91525790,,0,,0,false,,

Studies on contemporary social sciences employ the concept of policy diffusion in many forms, such as in identifying a global policy innovation, and in adopting international principles and standards into countries. For instance, many studies discuss how central and local governments have adopted the global policy innovation within a particular period of time, assessing which considerations might have influenced policymakers in adopting international principles and standards (Gilardi & Wasserfallen, 2017; Tosun & Croissant, 2016; Shipan & Volden, 2012; Simmons et al., 2006).; Human rights are believed as the dominant approach to social justice globally (Goodale & Merry, 2007).

199-414-501-650-51X,Lessons for New York: Comparative Urban Governance and the Challenge of Climate Change,2014-08-01,2014,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Andrea L. McArdle,"Climate change and the weather disasters to which it contributes are major challenges for urban governance. Using New York City’s experience with Superstorm Sandy as a launching point, the Article addresses the fundamental question of urban governance that weather disasters present. Recognizing the direct and immediate connection local government bears to coastal land, infrastructure, and the people who live and work within its borders, the role of a municipality in preparing for and responding to weather disasters is clear. However, the enormity and complexity of weather-related disaster preparedness limit the capacity of any individual local government to cope with these phenomena.To consider the governance challenge in the context of weather disasters, Part I contextualizes the question by providing an overview of New York City’s principal pre-Superstorm Sandy climate change mitigation measures under the administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. It then examines, in Sandy’s aftermath, the City’s commitment to a set of initiatives to develop capacity to withstand future weather events. It first considers the City’s set of initiatives in relation to the “vertical” governance structure in the United States that serves as the source of authority, policy guidance, and fiscal support for confronting the challenges of climate change. The balance of the Article explores an alternative approach for addressing climate-change challenges that links urban governments horizontally, across national borders. Specifically, Part II introduces interurban networks that operate within a normative framework established by international protocols. This Part focuses attention principally on the foundational assumptions grounding three networks of cities: the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, an organization of large cities in partnership with the World Bank, the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) — Local Governments for Sustainability, and a number of philanthropic organizations; Rockefeller Foundation-initiated resilience networks; and Resilient Cities, an annual global forum initiated in 2010 by ICLEI, the World Mayors Council on Climate Change, and the City of Bonn, Germany.Part III draws on the literature of network governance models and considers how transnational urban networks can offer a framework for comparative governance by serving as a continuing reference point on climate change, and a basis for generating shared norms for developing resilience to climate-change effects. Specifically, this Part addresses ways in which interurban initiatives such as C40 Cities and Resilient Cities make cities more salient, by recognizing the crucial role that cities play both as contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and thus global warming, and as loci of innovation, experimentation, and creativity. It develops the argument that these collaborative networks exemplify an alternative approach to governance in which cities are linked together horizontally to commit to innovation, promote policy diffusion through the exchange of ideas, expertise, and resources, and adopt best practices for climate-change mitigation and adaptation strategies.Part IV addresses potential limitations, including the enduring pro-growth orientation of cities, which may militate against city-led climate-related resilience strategies, referred to as “managed coastal retreat,” that entail scaling back waterfront development. Another consideration is that cities’ climate, geography, and economy will vary, and in any given instance a city’s experience may not be replicable in other contexts. This Part also takes up the concern that highly influential non-state actors engaged in international development or philanthropy may eclipse the role of local governments and reinforce paternalism vis-a-vis less resourced localities. Noting the general benefits that cities can derive from a problem solving approach responsive to, but not limited by, individual cities’ experience and scale, the Article concludes that cities’ participation in transnational urban networks holds some promise from a comparative governance perspective. To the extent that these interurban networks can promote members’ voluntary participation in, and adherence to, developing norms and practices for addressing climate-related risks, they enhance transnational problem solving on an issue that is simultaneously local and global. Further, they raise the possibility that local-level innovation of climate-related measures falling within the scope of local authority can jumpstart the stalled process of developing wider consensus on climate change that has eluded efforts of governments at the national scale.",,,,,Psychological resilience; Sociology; Network governance; Local government; Climate resilience; Public administration; Corporate governance; Climate change mitigation; Sustainability; International development,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2614819_code492673.pdf?abstractid=2614819&mirid=5 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2614819,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2614819,,,785909963,,0,,1,false,,
