AB With the increasing availability of effective, evidence-based physical
   activity interventions, widespread diffusion is needed. We examine
   conceptual foundations for research on dissemination and diffusion of
   physical activity interventions; describe two school-based program
   examples; review examples of dissemination and diffusion research on
   other health behaviors; and examine policies that may accelerate the
   diffusion process. Lack of dissemination and diffusion evaluation
   research and policy advocacy is one of the factors limiting the impact
   of evidence-based physical activity interventions on public health.
   There is the need to collaborate with policy experts from other fields
   to improve the interdisciplinary science base for dissemination and
   diffusion. The promise of widespread adoption of evidence-based physical
   activity interventions to improve public health is sufficient to justify
   devotion of substantial resources to the relevant research on
   dissemination and diffusion.

AB Context: The 2-1-1 helpline is a social services innovation that has
   spread rapidly throughout the U. S. Policy diffusion theory suggests
   that policymakers seek to reduce uncertainty by anticipating the effects
   of a proposed innovation through tools such as cost-benefit analyses.
   Few policy diffusion studies have examined use of information, such as
   cost-benefit analyses, in the diffusion process. The purpose of this
   study is to examine how cost-benefit analyses were used during the rapid
   diffusion of 2-1-1 across states. The paper also describes components of
   2-1-1 cost-benefit analyses.
   Evidence acquisition: In 2011, cost-benefit analyses of 2-1-1 and
   substantive citations of them were identified through scholarly key word
   searches using Academic Search Premier and Web of Science, general
   Internet searches using Google search terms, and communications with
   academicians and 2-1-1 practitioners through personal contact and e-mail
   discussion groups. To be included in this study, documents had to be
   related to 2-1-1 helplines, present information about their costs and
   benefits, and be formal documents. The documents were catalogued and
   analyzed for cost-benefit analyses or references to analyses, and stated
   purpose.
   Evidence synthesis: Of the 19 documents that met eligibility inclusion
   criteria, nine were original cost-benefit analyses and ten referenced
   analyses conducted for other jurisdictions.
   Conclusions: The diffusion of 2-1-1 helplines in the U. S. has been
   influenced by interjurisdictional exchange of cost-benefit analyses, in
   both the creation of original analyses and/or the referencing of
   previous work. (Am J Prev Med 2012;43(6S5):S497-S505) (C) 2012 American

AB In recent years, China has focused its development on technological
   innovation, trying to achieve a win-win situation between environmental
   protection and economic growth, and it has formulated a series of
   policies to promote technological innovation. Taking China's national
   independent innovation demonstration zone (NIIDZ) policy as an example,
   this paper empirically investigates the impact of China's innovation
   policy on haze pollution by using a difference-in-differences (DID)
   model. The results show that the NIIDZ policy promotes the governance of
   urban haze pollution and confirms the applicability of the
   experimentalist governance model in the practice of innovation policy in
   developing countries. Dynamic analysis shows that the NIIDZ policy has
   an experience accumulation effect. This policy can continue to promote
   haze control for at least 6 years, and the policy effect increases year
   by year. Action mechanism analysis shows that the NIIDZ policy can
   inhibit urban haze pollution by promoting urban technological innovation
   and high-tech industrial agglomeration. The estimation results of the
   spatial DID model show that the NIIDZ policy not only inhibits haze
   pollution in NIIDZ cities but also has an inhibitory effect on haze
   pollution in the surrounding non-NIIDZ cities and the NIIDZ cities,
   which confirms the positive externality characteristics of policy
   diffusion theory and environmental governance. The conclusions of this
   paper have important theoretical value for understanding the ecological
   effect of innovation policy and provide experience for developing
   countries to implement an experimentalist governance model.

AB The emergence of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) science movements is becoming a
   topic widely discussed in academia and policy, as well as by the general
   public and the media.While DIY approaches enjoy increasing diffusion
   even in official research, different social actors frequently talk about
   them in different ways and circumstances. Interaction and negotiation
   processes amongst actors (e.g. policy makers and DIY communities) define
   the premises upon which different conceptualisations of DIY science are
   deployed.
   In this paper we offer a framework for analysing the discourse on DIY
   science.
   Our study consists of a field research of three spaces active in DIY
   science premises, two dedicated events of the DIY community, and an
   auto-ethnography in the field of DIY biology.
   By relying on the theory of social worlds/arenas (SW/A), we collected
   data on how notions of DIY science are constructed by different social
   actors and how conceptual borders are built or are likely to shift,
   resulting in multiple possible SW/A mappings. We conclude that each and
   every conceptualisation of DIY science cannot stand independently from
   the situatedness of its multiple contexts, therefore making its usage in
   policy making and governance particularly complex.

TI IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT IN DANISH MUNICIPAL CONTEXT

EP 214

PD DEC 2014
PY 2014
AB Aims: Implementation of Health Impact Assessment (HIA) in Danish
   municipalities has been analyzed using the Roger's Diffusion of
   Innovation Theory. Municipalities were chosen from among those who
   presented their health policies on websites according to the status of
   inclusion of HIA into health policy.
   Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted in 6 municipalities (3
   with HIA inducted in their health policy and 3 without it) gathering
   information on knowledge and attitudes to HIA, barriers to its
   implementation, social system and communication channels used or
   expected to be used for implementation of HIA.
   Results: No significant differences were found among analyzed
   municipalities by status of HIA inclusion into health policy. Among
   barriers, a lack of tools with general validity, a lack of intersectoral
   working culture, balance between centralized versus participatory way of
   working and organizational structure of a municipality, and a lack of
   capacities were enlisted as most relevant. The last one is a crucial
   factor of an internal social system of a municipality. With regards to
   communication channels, reporting and presentation skills of
   implementers and doers are of key importance.
   Conclusions: Systematic and sustainable capacity building is needed to
   achieve high level implementation of HIA in Danish municipalities.
   Development of validated tools, most importantly screening tools with
   focus on priorities of national public health policy would enhance
   implementation on municipal level.

AB We analyze the adoption of nonpharmaceutical interventions in the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries
   during the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   pandemic. Given the complexity associated with pandemic decisions,
   governments are faced with the dilemma of how to act quickly when their
   core decision-making processes are based on deliberations balancing
   political considerations. Our findings show that, in times of severe
   crisis, governments follow the lead of others and base their decisions
   on what other countries do. Governments in countries with a stronger
   democratic structure are slower to react in the face of the pandemic but
   are more sensitive to the influence of other countries. We provide
   insights for research on international policy diffusion and research on
   the political consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB This article examines the global legislative response to the HIV/AIDS
   epidemic with a particular focus on how policies were diffused
   internationally or regionally, or facilitated internally.
   This article uses event history analysis combined with multinomial logit
   regression to model the legislative response of 133 countries.
   First, the results demonstrate that the WHO positively influenced the
   likelihood of a legislative response. Second, the article demonstrates
   that development bank aid helped to spur earlier legislative action.
   Third, the results demonstrate that developed countries acted earlier
   than developing countries. And finally, the onset and severity of the
   HIV/AIDS epidemic was a significant influence on the legislative
   response.
   Multilateral organizations have a positive influence in global policy
   diffusion through informational advocacy, technical assistance, and
   financial aid. It is also clear that internal stressors play key roles
   in legislative action seen clearly through earlier action being taken in
   countries where the shock of the onset of HIV/AIDS occurred earlier and
   earlier responses taken where the epidemic was more severe.

AB Along with monitoring air pollution level and rapid economic growth in

   innovation (EPI) capacity of local governments. However, scholarly
   research has not yet clarified the ability of local governments in EPI
   and its related drivers and impacts. This study explores the dynamic
   relations between EPI, air pollution, and the economy for the first
   time, using the simultaneous equation model (SEM) in China during
   2006-2015 across 30 provinces. To calculate EPI, this study introduces
   the comprehensive concept of policy innovation, consisting of invention,
   diffusion, and evaluation. The results show that EPI is strongly
   promoted by air pollution; however, promoting EPI alone cannot decrease
   air pollution. These results would vary among eastern and western
   provinces. Economic growth has a significant positive effect on EPI and
   can significantly reduce air pollution. This study suggests policymakers
   strengthen EPI in order to achieve a balance between air pollution and
   economic growth.

AB Europe has always played a key role in the field of Occupational Health
   and Safety (OHS) and can be considered the cradle of Occupational
   Health. The European policy framework has been set since the
   establishment of the European Union, but its strength lies in the
   enactment of the Framework Directive on Occupational Health and Safety
   (89/391/EC), which has had a strong positive impact on the assessment
   and management of occupational risk factors and has promoted the quick
   diffusion of common standards across Europe. Yet, some implementation
   issues still remain to be addressed, due to changes in the world of
   work, fragmentation, economic crisis and, more generally, to the impact
   of globalization. Therefore, actions need to be reviewed with respect to
   research plans and policy implementation so as to support the OHS social

AB OBJECTIVE To assess the diffusion of the change of first line
   antimalarial drug from chloroquine (CQ) to sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine
   (SP) at household level in a rural district of Tanzania less than a year
   after the policy implementation.
   METHODS Caretakers in 729 households were interviewed on knowledge of
   the new policy, home stocking of antimalarials, home-treatment practices
   of children younger than 5 years with fever, health-seeking behaviour
   and experience of SP. SP and CQ levels in blood were analysed from 328
   children younger than 5 years in the households. Twelve focus group
   discussions (FGD) were performed with mothers, fathers and health
   workers.
   RESULTS About 51% of the population knew that SP was the first line
   antimalarial. Only 8% of mothers stocked antimalarials, and only 4%
   stated self-treatment as the first action. We estimated that 84% of the
   children who had had fever during the last 4 weeks sought care at public
   health facilities. SP was detectable in 18% of the total child
   population and in 32% of those with reported fever, CQ in only 5% and
   7%, respectively. The FGDs revealed negative perceptions of SP and fear
   of severe adverse reactions with mass media reported as key informant.
   CONCLUSION The policy had diffused to the communities in the sense that
   CQ had been changed to SP, which was well known as first line treatment.
   Moreover, there was a reported dramatic change from self-treatment with
   CQ to seeking care at public health facilities where SP was given under
   observation.

AB Injuries are the leading killer of children in the United States, at a
   rate significantly higher than in other industrialized countries. In
   this article, we outline how a behaviorally and developmentally based
   model of prevention may assist in determining effective interventions
   for various injury risks. Two conclusions emerge: (a) the strength of
   perceived costs and consequences for taking effective safety actions
   greatly influences the probability that they will be implemented; and
   (b) intervening at the most developmentally appropriate time is likely
   to result in more effective outcomes. Further, clinical psychologists
   are uniquely suited to assess contingencies that maintain unsafe
   practices, but we need to enlist the participation of citizens and other
   professionals to mount persuasive intervention campaigns. Despite strong
   demonstration projects, childhood injury reduction has lagged behind
   other public health endeavors. Obstacles to injury prevention include
   (a) the diffusion of injury threats, complicating the identification of
   effective targets for intervention; (b) the tendency of parents and even
   some health professionals to regard injuries as products of fate, which
   fosters complacency; (c) the failure of U.S. social service policy to
   support preventive strategies; and (d) an American cultural tradition of
   opposing regulation. Suggestions for improved public policy and
   intervention procedures are advanced. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This study reviews existing legal, institutional and policy tools and

   Mediterranean and the Baltic. A combination of desk studies in six
   countries bordering the Baltic (Estonia, Germany, Sweden) and the
   Mediterranean (Greece, Italy, Tunisia), and interviews with experts and
   stakeholders, is used to identify key drivers and barriers to the
   adoption and diffusion of marine litter technologies. The main
   conclusion of the study is that the most influential pieces of
   legislation relevant to marine litter management are top-down EU
   policies, often forming the basis of regional and national plans.
   Moreover, the study finds that several drivers of marine litter
   technologies may at the same time be critical barriers. These factors
   include public awareness, consumer behaviour, enforcement of
   legislation, and the rise of SMEs engaged in recycling and eco-labelling
   of marine litter.

AB During the last two decades Oman has experienced rapid economic
   development but this has been accompanied by environmental problems.
   Manufacturing and agricultural output have increased substantially but
   initially this was not balanced with sufficient environmental
   management. Although agriculture in Oman is not usually considered a
   major component of the economy, government policy has been directed
   towards diversification of national income and as a result there has
   been an increasing emphasis on revenue from agriculture and an
   enhancement of production via the use of irrigation, machinery and
   inputs such as pesticides. In recent years this has been tempered with a
   range of interventions to encourage more sustainable production. Certain
   pesticides have been prohibited; there has been a promotion of organic
   agriculture and an emphasis on education and awareness programs for
   farmers. The last point is of especial relevance given the nature of the
   farm labour market in Oman and a reliance on expatriate and often
   untrained labour. The research, through a detailed stratified survey,
   explores the state of knowledge at farm-level regarding the safe
   disposal of pesticide waste and what factors could enhance or indeed
   operate against the spread and implementation of that knowledge. Members
   of the recently constituted Farmers Association expressed greater
   environmental awareness than their non-member counterparts in that they
   identified a more diverse range of potential risks associated with
   pesticide use and disposed of pesticide waste more in accordance with
   government policy, albeit government policy with gaps. Workers on farms
   belonging to Association members were also more likely to adhere to
   government policy in terms of waste disposal. The Farmers Association
   appears to be an effective conduit for the diffusion of knowledge about
   pesticide legislation and general awareness, apparently usurping the
   state agricultural extension service. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Objectives. We determined the number of state Medicaid programs adopting
   initiatives to support preventive dental services provision by nondental
   health care professionals, their perceived attributes, and
   implementation barriers.
   Methods. We used Qualtrics to conduct a cross-sectional survey in 2008
   of Medicaid dental program managers to determine organizational stage of
   adoption classified according to the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior
   Change with 3-year follow-up. We assessed perceptions of the influence
   of 18 initiative attributes on the decision to adopt, drawn from Roger's
   diffusion of innovations theory. Stage and date of adoption are
   presented descriptively. Attributes and barriers were analyzed by stage
   of adoption by using analyses of variance or v 2 statistics.
   Results. By 2011, 42 states had adopted a policy. Only 9 states included
   a comprehensive set of preventive services, the most common being
   fluoride varnish. Adoption was affected by perceived initiative
   simplicity and its compatibility with other Medicaid programs.
   Administrative barriers were the most common among the 15 studied.
   Conclusions. State Medicaid policies to reimburse nondental providers
   for preventive dental services are becoming widespread. Interventions
   are needed to ensure oral health services delivery at the practice
   level.

AB Air pollution has become a global threat to societal development. The
   main challenges of transboundary air pollution control include two
   perspectives: uneven socioeconomic development of regions and the
   diffusion of air pollution. This paper proposes an PES strategy to
   alleviate transboundary air pollution by coordinating regional economic
   interests and environmental preferences within the joint prevention and
   control of air pollution region. To make the model de-sign more
   realistic, we introduce the stochastic differential game model to
   characterize the diffusion and uncertainty of air pollution. The optimal
   feedback Nash equilibrium is derived in three PES scenarios (no PES,
   dynamic PES, and fixed-fee PES) by using the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
   equation. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis are
   im-plemented to compare the optimal strategies under the three PES
   scenarios. The dynamic PES strategy is shown to out-perform the no PES
   strategy and the fixed-fee PES strategy by encouraging the backward
   region to cut more emissions. Besides, the confidence interval theory is
   used to estimate the variation range of air pollution stocks, which
   provides a powerful diagnostic tool for policy-makers.

AB We analyze the driving mechanism of the River-Director System reform in
   the article. Using the ordered probit model, the effect of the
   River-Director System policy was evaluated by observing the monthly
   water quality data of 170 water areas along the boundary of the Yangtze
   River system. It determines that the driving force of the local
   government's basin governance under the river system is mainly the
   top-down policy directives and that the driving path is effective
   synergy, rights, and diffusion in the article. We find that the upstream
   provinces and municipalities that implemented reforms have significantly
   improved the water quality of the waters in the border basin, compared
   with the provinces and cities that have not implemented the reform of
   the river system and the river basins that have implemented policy
   reforms but are located in the lower reaches of the rivers. At the same
   time, the city's reforms have significantly improved the quality of the
   junction basin water body. The implementation of the River-Director
   System has reduced the occurrences of local pollution emission and
   improved the water quality of the provincial boundaries through sewage
   treatment. We further validate the robustness of the basic conclusions
   by deleting special samples and changing the window type and other
   robust tests. Finally, through monthly examinations on the
   implementation of the policy, it finds that the effectiveness of the
   policy reform became more apparent in the eleventh month.

AB We sought to examine the strategies promoting and countering state
   preemption of local sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes in the United
   States. Using Crosbie and Schmidt's tobacco preemption framework, we
   analyzed key tactics used by the SSB industry to achieve state
   preemption of local taxes identified in news sources, industry Web
   sites, government reports, and public documents.
   Starting in 2017, 4 states rejected and 4 passed laws preempting local
   SSB taxes. The beverage industry attempted to secure state preemption
   through front groups and trade associations, lobbying key policymakers,
   inserting preemptive language into other legislation, and issuing legal
   threats and challenges. The public health community's response is in the
   early stages of engaging in media advocacy, educating policymakers,
   mobilizing national collaboration, and expanding legal networks.
   State preemption of local SSB taxes is in the early stages but will
   likely scale up as local tax proposals increase. The public health
   community has a substantial role in proactively working to prevent
   preemption concurrent with health policy activity and using additional
   strategies successfully used in tobacco control to stop preemption
   diffusion.

AB The diffusion of Covid-19 has called governments and public health
   authorities to interventions aiming at limiting new infections and
   containing the expected number of critical cases and deaths. Most of
   these measures rely on the compliance of people, who are asked to reduce
   their social contacts to a minimum. In this note we argue that
   individuals' adherence to prescriptions and reduction of social activity
   may not be efficacious if not implemented robustly on all social groups,
   especially on those characterized by intense mixing patterns. Actually,
   it is possible that, if those who have many contacts have reduced them
   proportionally less than those who have few, then the effect of a policy
   could have backfired: the disease has taken more time to die out, up to
   the point that it has become endemic. In a nutshell, unless one gets
   everyone to act, and specifically those who have more contacts, a policy
   may even be counterproductive.

AB Health technology assessment (HTA) is the multidisciplinary study of the
   implications of the development, diffusion and use of health
   technologies. It supports health-policy decisions by providing a joint
   knowledge base for decision-makers. To increase its policy relevance,
   HTA tries to extend beyond effectiveness and costs to also considering
   the social, organizational and ethical implications of technologies.
   However, a commonly accepted method for analysing the ethical aspects of
   health technologies is lacking.
   This paper describes a model for ethical analysis of health technology
   that is easy and flexible to use in different organizational settings
   and cultures. The model is part of the EUnetHTA project, which focuses
   on the transferability of HTAs between countries.
   The EUnetHTA ethics model is based on the insight that the whole HTA
   process is value laden. It is not sufficient to only analyse the ethical
   consequences of a technology, but also the ethical issues of the whole
   HTA process must be considered. Selection of assessment topics, methods
   and outcomes is essentially a value-laden decision. Health technologies
   may challenge moral or cultural values and beliefs, and their
   implementation may also have significant impact on people other than the
   patient. These are essential considerations for health policy. The
   ethics model is structured around key ethical questions rather than
   philosophical theories, to be applicable to different cultures and
   usable by non-philosophers.
   Integrating ethical considerations into HTA can improve the relevance of
   technology assessments for health care and health policy in both
   developed and developing countries.

AB Agroecology has been proposed as a strategy to improve food system
   sustainability, but has also been criticised for using land
   inefficiently. We compared five explorative storylines, developed in a
   stakeholder process, for future food systems in the EU to 2050. We
   modelled a range of biophysical (e.g., land use and food production),
   environmental (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) and social indicators,
   and potential for regional food self-sufficiency, and investigated the
   economic policy needed to reach these futures by 2050. Two contrasting
   storylines for upscaling agroecological practices emerged. In one,
   agroecology was implemented to produce high-value products serving
   high-income consumers through trade but, despite 40% of agricultural
   area being under organic management, only two out of eight EU
   environmental policy targets were met. As diets followed current trends
   in this storyline, there were few improvements in environmental
   indicators compared with the current situation, despite large-scale
   implementation of agroecological farming practices. This suggests that
   large-scale implementation of agroecological practices without
   concurrent changes on the demand side could aggravate existing
   environmental pressures. However, our second agroecological storyline
   showed that if large-scale diffusion of agroecological farming practices
   were implemented alongside drastic dietary change and waste reductions,
   major improvements on environmental indicators could be achieved and all
   relevant EU policy targets met. An alternative storyline comprising
   sustainable intensification in combination with dietary change and waste
   reductions was efficient in meeting targets related to climate,
   biodiversity, ammonia emissions, and use of antibiotics, but did not
   meet targets for reductions in pesticide and fertiliser use. These
   results confirm the importance of dietary change for food system climate
   change mitigation. Economic modelling showed a need for drastic changes
   in consumer preferences towards more plant-based, agroecological and
   local foods, and for improvements in technology, for these storylines to
   be realised, as very high taxes and tariffs would otherwise be needed.

AB The building and construction sector accounts for around 39% of global
   carbon dioxide emissions and remains a hard-to-abate sector. We use a
   data-driven analysis of global high-level climate action on emissions
   reduction in the building sector using 256,717 English-language tweets
   across a 13-year time frame (2009-2021). Using natural language
   processing and network analysis, we show that public sentiments and
   emotions on social media are reactive to these climate policy actions.
   Between 2009-2012, discussions around green building-led emission
   reduction efforts were highly influential in shaping the online public
   perceptions of climate action. From 2013 to 2016, communication around
   low-carbon construction and energy efficiency significantly influenced
   the online narrative. More significant interactions on net-zero
   transition, climate tech, circular economy, mass timber housing and
   climate justice in 2017-2021 shaped the online climate action discourse.
   We find positive sentiments are more prominent and recurrent and
   comprise a larger share of the social media conversation. However, we
   also see a rise in negative sentiment by 30-40% following popular policy
   events like the IPCC report launches, the Paris Agreement and the EU
   Green Deal. With greater online engagement and information diffusion,
   social and environmental justice topics emerge in the online discourse.
   Continuing such shifts in online climate discourse is pivotal to a more
   just and people-centric transition in such hard-to-decarbonise sectors.

AB In the Netherlands, less than 1% of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus
   aureus are methicillin-resistant (MRSA). A national search and destroy
   policy prevents MRSA from becoming endemic. Some MRSA outbreaks cannot
   be related to patients at risk for MRSA carriage. This study was
   designed to measure the prevalence of MRSA among patients without risk
   factors for MRSA carriage at the time of admission to the hospital. In
   four Dutch hospitals, patients admitted to non-surgical departments in
   the period 1999 - 2000 were screened for MRSA nasal carriage. Nasal
   swabs were streaked on 5% sheep blood agar (BA), submerged in a
   selective broth, and incubated for two to three days at 35 degreesC.
   Colonies suspected of being S. aureus were identified with an
   agglutination test. Susceptibility testing was performed by an automated
   system and additional oxacillin disk diffusion. Methicillin resistance
   was confirmed by a DNA hybridization test and mecA PCR. MRSA strains
   were genotyped by pulsed-field get electrophoresis (PFGE). Twenty-four
   percent (2332/9859) of the patients were S. aureus nasal carriers. Only
   three (0.03%) patients were MRSA carriers. These patients were not
   repatriated, nor known to be MRSA carriers before screening. Genotyping
   revealed that the strains were not clonally related and were not related
   to MRSA outbreaks in the hospital where the patients were admitted. We
   conclude that at routine admission to a Dutch hospital (excluding
   high-risk foreign admissions) the MRSA prevalence is low (0.03%), due to
   the Dutch search and destroy policy and restrictive antibiotic
   prescribing. (C) 2004 The Hospital Infection Society. Published by

AB Aims To examine how institutional constraints, comprising federal
   actions and states' substance abuse policy environments, influence
   states' decisions to activate Medicaid reimbursement codes for screening
   and brief intervention for risky substance use in the United States.
   Methods A discrete-time duration model was used to estimate the effect
   of institutional constraints on the likelihood of activating the
   Medicaid reimbursement codes. Primary constraints included federal
   Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) grant
   funding, substance abuse priority, economic climate, political climate
   and interstate diffusion. Study data came from publicly available
   secondary data sources. Results Federal SBIRT grant funding did not
   affect significantly the likelihood of activation (P = 0.628). A $1
   increase in per-capita block grant funding was associated with a
   10-percentage point reduction in the likelihood of activation (P =
   0.003) and a $1 increase in per-capita state substance use disorder
   expenditures was associated with a 2-percentage point increase in the
   likelihood of activation (P = 0.004). States with enacted parity laws (P
   = 0.016) and a Democratic-controlled state government were also more
   likely to activate the codes. Conclusion In the United States, the
   determinants of state activation of Medicaid Screening, Brief
   Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) reimbursement codes are
   complex, and include more than financial considerations. Federal block
   grant funding is a strong disincentive to activating the SBIRT
   reimbursement codes, while more direct federal SBIRT grant funding has
   no detectable effects.

AB China generates the world's second-largest amount of municipal solid
   waste (MSW) and incinerates the largest quantity of MSW. However, data
   on the latest dioxin emissions from MSW incineration (MSWI) and the
   related global share were lacking. In the context of MSW classification,
   distinguishing the long-term MSW generation and incineration quantity,
   and dioxin emissions was necessary for macro-control and policy-making
   by the Chinese Government. By considering population size and GDP per
   capita, China's MSW generation toward 2050 was projected based on Monte
   Carlo simulation. Moreover, dioxin emission factors were also assumed
   based on the diffusion rate of four grades of air pollution control
   devices (APCDs). Finally, we show that the quantity of China's MSW
   generation in 2050 will be 363.50 million tonnes (Mt) with 341.06-382.45
   Mt of 75% certainty. China's dioxin emissions from MSWI were
   approximately 15.46 g I-TEQ in 2019, which accounted for 26.1% of total
   emissions from global MSWI. We discuss dioxin emission reduction
   scenarios depending on MSW diversion and APCD upgrades. China's dioxin
   emissions will be 70.38 g I-TEQ for the business-as-usual scenario, and
   the dioxin emissions will be 9.29 g I-TEQ (within the range of 8.88-9.64
   g I-TEQ) for the optimal scenario in 2050. Moreover, in 2050, the APCD
   diffusion rate will account for 98.8% of the sensitivity of dioxin
   emissions from China's MSWI. According to the assumed scenarios, there
   is a dioxin emission reduction potential of 18.6% and 86.8% in 2050 by
   MSW diversion alone and maximum APCD upgrades combined with food waste
   diversion, respectively.

AB Background: Following confirmation of the effectiveness of voluntary
   medical male circumcision (VMMC) for HIV prevention, the World Health
   Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS issued
   recommendations in 2007. Less than 5 y later, priority countries are at
   different stages of program scale-up. This paper analyzes the progress
   towards the scale-up of VMMC programs. It analyzes the adoption of VMMC
   as an additional HIV prevention strategy and explores the factors may
   have expedited or hindered the adoption of policies and initial program
   implementation in priority countries to date.
   Methods and Findings: VMMCs performed in priority countries between 2008
   and 2010 were recorded and used to classify countries into five adopter
   categories according to the Diffusion of Innovations framework. The main
   predictors of VMMC program adoption were determined and factors
   influencing subsequent scale-up explored. By the end of 2010, over
   550,000 VMMCs had been performed, representing approximately 3% of the
   target coverage level in priority countries. The "early adopter"
   countries developed national VMMC policies and initiated VMMC program
   implementation soon after the release of the WHO recommendations.
   However, based on modeling using the Decision Makers' Program Planning
   Tool (DMPPT), only Kenya appears to be on track towards achievement of
   the DMPPT-estimated 80% coverage goal by 2015, having already achieved
   61.5% of the DMPPT target. None of the other countries appear to be on
   track to achieve their targets. Potential predicators of early adoption
   of male circumcision programs include having a VMMC focal person,
   establishing a national policy, having an operational strategy, and the
   establishment of a pilot program.
   Conclusions: Early adoption of VMMC policies did not necessarily result
   in rapid program scale-up. A key lesson is the importance of not only
   being ready to adopt a new intervention but also ensuring that factors
   critical to supporting and accelerating scale-up are incorporated into
   the program. The most successful program had country ownership and
   sustained leadership to translate research into a national policy and
   program.

AB The recent proliferation of digital databases of cultural and linguistic
   data, together with new statistical techniques becoming available has
   lead to a rise in so-called nomothetic studies [1-8]. These seek
   relationships between demographic variables and cultural traits from
   large, cross-cultural datasets. The insights from these studies are
   important for understanding how cultural traits evolve. While these
   studies are fascinating and are good at generating testable hypotheses,
   they may underestimate the probability of finding spurious correlations
   between cultural traits. Here we show that this kind of approach can
   find links between such unlikely cultural traits as traffic accidents,
   levels of extra-martial sex, political collectivism and linguistic
   diversity. This suggests that spurious correlations, due to historical
   descent, geographic diffusion or increased noise-to-signal ratios in
   large datasets, are much more likely than some studies admit. We suggest
   some criteria for the evaluation of nomothetic studies and some
   practical solutions to the problems. Since some of these studies are
   receiving media attention without a widespread understanding of the
   complexities of the issue, there is a risk that poorly controlled
   studies could affect policy. We hope to contribute towards a general
   skepticism for correlational studies by demonstrating the ease of
   finding apparently rigorous correlations between cultural traits.
   Despite this, we see well-controlled nomothetic studies as useful tools
   for the development of theories.

AB Background
   Better understanding of the characteristics of interventions which are
   attractive to nurses is required in order to implement effective hand
   hygiene interventions.
   Methods
   The intervention characteristics were derived from diffusion of
   innovation theory (DIT): relative advantage, compatibility, simplicity,
   trialability, and observability. To identify nurses' preferences for the
   five characteristics, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted.
   Participants were nurses working at Taiwanese tertiary care hospitals
   selected through stratified sampling. In addition, the hand hygiene
   moment (before or after patient contact) was taken into consideration in
   the DCE to investigate whether nurses' preferences for the intervention
   characteristics were the same at different hand hygiene moments.
   Results
   This survey was conducted between 1 October and 31 December 2014. Among
   200 nurses from three Taiwanese tertiary care hospitals, significant
   preferences for the five intervention characteristics were observed.
   That is, when an intervention makes the hand hygiene activity more
   convenient (p<0.001), when nurses participate in the design of the
   intervention (p<0.001), when an intervention is explained well to nurses
   before implementing it (p<0.001), when the evidence of hand hygiene is
   provided at a trial stage to show its effectiveness (p<0.001), and when
   nurses' hand hygiene performance is observable to their peers (p<0.001),
   nurses are more willing to wash their hands with high compliance. In
   addition, nurses preferred for providing evidence at a trial stage most,
   and well explanation about the intervention to increase simplicity was
   least. The rankings of the preference for the five intervention
   characteristics were the same at different hand hygiene moments (p =
   0.453)
   Conclusions
   The findings suggest policy directions for decision makers aiming to
   improve overall hand hygiene compliance in healthcare facilities.

AB Efforts at reducing tobacco use in the United States and Canada over the
   last half century have been amazingly successful. This article examines
   those efforts in order to identify policies, programs, and practices
   found useful in tobacco control that might be usefully disseminated to
   world populations to improve rates of physical activity. Tobacco-control
   activities began with efforts to influence the individual smoker through
   public education and counter-advertising. Increasing awareness of the
   addictive properties of tobacco, industry efforts to manipulate those
   properties, and to target youth with aggressive advertising, fueled
   public outrage that supported additional policy changes to include
   community interventions, legal actions, and restraints against the
   tobacco industry. The article first examines ways to view the process of
   transferring knowledge from one enterprise (reducing tobacco
   consumption) to another (increasing physical activity). Several theories
   of knowledge generalization and dissemination are explored: transfer,
   knowledge utilization, application, diffusion, and implementation. The
   second section identifies the dissemination of tobacco control by means
   of brief health behavior-change interventions for smoking cessation that
   have been successfully integrated into primary clinical care. The
   question of whether similar strategies can be successfully disseminated
   to increase physical activity is examined in detail. The article then
   moves on to look at the success of arguably the most successful program
   in the world at achieving a reduction in tobacco control-the State of
   California. Finally, we compare and contrast some of the lessons as they
   have played out in another national context-Canada. In the concluding
   section, some lessons are identified that we believe may be successfully
   utilized in societal attempts to increase physical activity in world
   populations.

AB The spread of SARS-COV-2 has affected many economic and social systems.
   This paper aims at estimating the impact on regional productive systems
   in Italy of the interplay between the epidemic and the mobility
   restriction measures put in place to contain the contagion. We focus
   then on the economic consequences of alternative lockdown lifting
   schemes. We leverage a massive dataset of human mobility which describes
   daily movements of over four million individuals in Italy and we model
   the epidemic spreading through a metapopulation SIR model, which
   provides the fraction of infected individuals in each Italian district.
   To quantify economic backslashes this information is combined with
   socio-economic data. We then carry out a scenario analysis to model the
   transition to a post-lockdown phase and analyze the economic outcomes
   derived from the interplay between (a) the timing and intensity of the
   release of mobility restrictions and (b) the corresponding scenarios on
   the severity of virus transmission rates. Using a simple model for the
   spreading disease and parsimonious assumptions on the relationship
   between the infection and the associated economic backlashes, we show
   how different policy schemes tend to induce heterogeneous distributions
   of losses at the regional level depending on mobility restrictions. Our
   work shed lights on how recovery policies need to balance the interplay
   between mobility flows of disposable workers and the diffusion of
   contagion.

AB Introduction: Federal policy supports increased implementation of
   monetary incentive interventions for chronic disease prevention among
   low-income populations. This study describes how a Prevention Research
   Center, working with a dissemination partner, developed and distributed
   technology to support nationwide implementation and evaluation of
   healthy food incentive programming focused on Supplemental Nutrition
   Assistance Program recipients.
   Methods: FM Tracks, an iOS-based application and website, was developed
   to standardize evaluation methods for healthy food incentive program
   implementation at direct-to-consumer markets. This evaluation examined
   diffusion and adoption of the technology over 9 months (July 2015 March
   2016). Data were analyzed in 2016.
   Results: FM Tracks was disseminated to 273 markets affiliated with 37
   regional networks in 18 states and Washington, DC. All markets adopted
   the sales transaction data collection feature, with nearly all recording
   at least one Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (99.3%) and
   healthy food incentive (97.1%) transaction. A total of 43,493 sales
   transactions were recorded. By the ninth month of technology
   dissemination, markets were entering individual sales transactions using
   the application (34.5%) and website (29.9%) and aggregated transactions
   via website (35.6%) at similar rates. Use of optional evaluation
   features like recording a customer ID with individual transactions
   increased successively with a low of 22.2% during the first month to a
   high of 69.2% in the ninth month.
   Conclusions: Systematic and widely used evaluation technology creates
   possibilities for pragmatic research embedded within ongoing, real-world
   implementation of food access interventions. Technology dissemination
   requires supportive technical assistance and continuous refinement that
   can be advanced through academic practitioner partnerships. (C) 2016

AB An effective and efficient disease prevention and control strategy is of
   paramount importance to improve the quality and quantity of livestock
   production in the Indian context. Although livestock vaccination is
   considered an emerging innovation of socio-economic importance in the
   Indian dairy industry, the rate of adoption and diffusion of vaccination
   technology is very low at field level. In this context, the authors
   examined the efforts of the Government of India to protect livestock
   health and control disease, considered the lessons learnt from
   rinderpest eradication, looked at field practices and the reality on the
   ground, and studied the perceptions of multiple stakeholders with
   regards to the relevance, profitability and sustainability of
   vaccination. In this study, the authors consider policy implications for
   the Indian dairy industry using the responses of 360 dairy farmers, 80
   research scientists and 40 extension workers in India. The study
   revealed that scientists and extension experts rated vaccination highly
   in terms of its relevance, profitability and sustainability, while the
   perception of farmers was less favourable. The study also observed that,
   even after implementation of various disease control programmes with
   heavy financial expenditure, there was a wide gap between farmers and
   scientists and between farmers and extension workers with regards to
   their perceptions of the relevance, profitability and sustainability of
   vaccination, while the gap was very narrow between scientists and
   extension workers. It can be concluded, therefore, that there is a need
   to generate innovations for disease control that are perceived as
   relevant, profitable and sustainable so as to encourage higher levels of
   diffusion and adoption atfield level. This study recommends thatfarmers
   partner with researchers and extension workers to ensure effective
   generation and transfer of new dairying technologies, leading to higher
   production and productivity in the Indian dairy sector.

AB Background: Despite evidence of benefits of telehealth networks in
   increasing access to, or providing, previously unavailable mental health
   services, care providers still prefer traditional approaches. For
   psychiatric assessment, digital technology can offer improvements over
   analog systems for the technical and, subsequently, the social quality
   of provider-client interaction. This is in turn expected to support
   greater provider uptake and enhanced patient benefits.
   Objective: Within the framework of Innovation Diffusion Theory, to study
   service providers' experiences of an existing regional telehealth
   network for mental health care practice twelve months after digitisation
   in order to identify the benefits of digital telehealth over an analog
   system for mental health care purposes in rural Australia.
   Methods: Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with
   over 40 service providers from June to September 2013 in South
   Australia, ranging from the metropolitan central operations to health
   providers located up to 600 km away in rural and remote areas of the
   same state. Participants included rural mental health teams, directors
   of nursing at rural hospitals, metropolitan-based psychiatrists and
   registrars, the metropolitan-based mental health team dedicated to rural
   provider support, rural GPs, administrative staff, and the executive
   group of the state rural health department. Fieldwork was conducted 12
   months after the analog system was digitised. The interview and focus
   group data were analysed using thematic analysis, focusing on three key
   areas of innovation diffusion theory: relative advantage, technical
   complexity and technical compatibility.
   Results: Five themes with 11 sub-themes were identified: (1) "Existing
   Uses", with three sub-themes: current mental health use, use by GPs, and
   use for staff support; (2) "Relative Advantage", with four sub-themes:
   improved technical quality, improved clinical practice, time and cost
   benefits for providers, and improved patient care; (3) "Technical
   Complexity"; (4) "Technical Compatibility" with two sub themes:
   technical-clinical and technical-administrative; and (5) "Broader
   Organisational Culture", with two sub-themes: organizational policy
   support and 'digital telehealth' culture.
   Conclusions: The digitised telehealth network was generally well
   received by providers and adopted into clinical practice. Compared with
   the previous analog system, staff found advantages in better visual and
   audio quality, more technical stability with less "drop-out", less time
   delay to conversations and less confusion for clients. Despite these
   advantages, providers identified a range of challenges to starting or
   continuing use and they recommended improvements to increase uptake
   among mental health service providers and other providers (including
   GPs), and to clinical uses other than mental health. To further increase
   uptake and impact of telehealth-mediated mental health care in rural and
   remote areas, even with a high quality digital system, future research
   must design innovative care models, consider time and cost incentives
   for providers to use telehealth, and must focus not only on technical
   training but also how to best integrate technology with clinical
   practice and must develop an organization-wide digital telehealth
   culture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background.: Health research institutions in the Eastern Mediterranean
   Region (EMR) can play an integral role in promoting and supporting
   Knowledge Translation (KT). Assessing institutions' engagement in KT and
   bridging the "research-policy" gap is important in designing
   context-specific strategies to promote KT and informing funding efforts
   in the region.
   Aims: The objective of this study was to explore the engagement of EMR
   institutions in KT activities.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of institutions undertaking health
   research in the 22 EMR countries was undertaken. The survey covered
   institutional characteristics, institutional planning for research,
   national planning for health research, and knowledge management,
   translation and dissemination.
   Results: 575 institutions were contacted of which 223 (38.3%) responded.
   Half the sampled institutions reported conducting priority-setting
   exercises, with 60.2% not following a standardized approach. Less than
   half institutions reported frequently/always (40.5%) involving
   policymakers and stakeholders in setting priorities for research on
   health. Only 26.5% of respondent institutions reported that they examine
   the extent to which health policymakers utilize their research results.
   Moreover, only 23.3% reported measuring the impact of their health
   research.
   Conclusions: There is still misalignment between national health
   research priorities and actual research production, and KT activities
   are still rarely undertaken by institutions in the EMR. National
   governments and international funding agencies are called to support
   research production and translation in the EMR. Institutions and
   researchers are also called to produce policy-relevant research and be
   responsive to the needs and priorities of policy-makers.

AB This paper deals with the environmentally important issue regarding how
   best to motivate citizens to reduce their individual waste production.
   The paper discusses the pros and cons of the various financial
   incentives incorporated into the waste charging mechanism,
   pay-as-you-throw (PAYT). Pay-as-you-throw breaks with the tradition of
   paying for waste services through general blanket taxes or levies in the
   form of flat rates in that households are required to pay individually
   adjusted fees in the same way as water and electricity bills are
   calculated on an individual consumption basis. This difference is
   achieved through the interplay of three principal components which mark
   the technical implementation of PAYT: identification as a vehicle to
   attain accountability, measurement of the generated waste and/or
   corresponding services, and unit pricing as the basis for individual
   charges proportional to the extent of the obtained services.
   However, any motivating factor for inducing citizens to dispose of their
   recyclable discards and residual waste must be supported by a well
   developed collection infrastructure, good media information and an
   appropriate, transparent charging policy. Of particular importance is
   the use of a multi-tiered charge model, i.e., the charging of a fixed
   minimum fee plus certain variable components payable in respect of the
   service structure. The introduction of a basic charge, albeit reducing
   the intensity of the incentives created by the PAYT system, ensures that
   certain fixed costs for the provision of waste services will be covered
   independently from the actual waste developments and, at the same time,
   minimises the temptation to attempt to bypass the system.
   Such an arrangement for the waste charges neither contradicts the
   principle of pay-as-you-throw nor does it impair the waste diversion for
   which it is implemented. Waste statistics and figures representing the
   waste charging situation in Germany indicate that there is a relatively
   good correlation between the level of recycling and the amount of
   perceived financial motivation provided by PAYT.
   Waste stream developments in areas using such charging schemes generally
   suggest that the reduction goals are being achieved. Single figures on
   decreasing quantities of collected residual waste, however, say little
   about the actual efficiency of differentiated waste charging models and
   deliver little in the way of reasoned explanation as to why the
   diffusion of variable rate pricing is progressing painstakingly slowly.
   To evaluate the success, feasibility and problems of PAYT schemes, one
   needs to consider the various ways for technically implementing this
   approach in practice, and must take a broader look into the wide
   spectrum of available waste services and into more factors that
   influence their efficiency and acceptance. Urban structure settings
   assume a particular importance here as do the specific goals of social
   policy which, among others, are reflected in the charging mechanisms
   applied. Practical experience, however, shows that solutions can be
   found which allow most of the concerns and area specifics to be
   accommodated and waste streams to be influenced in the desired way.
   Aside from this, positive effects as to waste collection efficiency can
   also be achieved, which contribute towards long-term environmental
   improvements and countervail the incremental costs of implementing PAYT.

AB Economics provides a framework for understanding management decisions
   and their policy implications for the animal health system. While the
   neoclassical economic model is useful for framing animal health
   decisions on the farm, some of its assumptions and prescriptive results
   may be unrealistic. Institutional and behavioural economics address some
   of these potential shortcomings by considering the role of information,
   psychology and social factors in decisions. Framing such decisions under
   contract theory allows us to consider asymmetric information between
   policy-makers and farmers. Perverse incentives may exist in the area of
   preventing and reporting disease. Behavioural economics examines the
   role of internal and external psychological and social factors. Biases,
   heuristics, habit, social norms and other such aspects can result in
   farm decision-makers arriving at what might be considered irrational or
   otherwise sub-optimal decisions. Framing choices and providing relevant
   information and examples can alleviate these behavioural issues. The
   implications of this approach for disease policy and an applied research
   and outreach programme to respond to animal diseases are discussed.

   Columbia, organized by Alexander C. Wagenaar and chaired by Mark S.
   Goldman. The purpose of the symposium was to present the design and
   outcomes from a recently completed multi-community controlled
   time-series trial entitled Complying with the Minimum Drinking Age
   (CMDA), which tested two approaches for enhancing the effectiveness of
   the legal drinking age policy: training of alcohol retailers, and police
   enforcement at alcohol establishments. Specific presentations were: (1)
   Introduction and Overview of the CMDA project by Alexander C. Wagenaar,
   (2) CMDA Interventions by Traci L. Toomey, (3) CMDA Measurement,
   Statistical Methods and Results by Darin J. Erickson, and (4)
   Conclusions, Implications and Future Applications by Alexander C.
   Wagenaar. Results from the trial show: (1) minimal effects of the brief
   version of Alcohol Risk Management training for alcohol outlet
   management, (2) significant effects of enforcement checks in reducing
   sales of alcohol to youth, (3) a concentration of effects in specific
   alcohol outlets experiencing an enforcement check with little diffusion
   of effects to other outlets in the community not experiencing a check,
   and (4) a substantial decay of enforcement effects over the three months
   following a specific check. In short, results showed significant and
   substantial specific deterrence effects, and little training effects.
   Results also illustrated the utility and strength of the controlled
   time-series trial research design. Additional research on temporal and
   geospatial distribution of community-level intervention effects is
   warranted.

AB Background and Objective: The rate of uptake of new medicines in the UK
   is slower than in many other OECD countries. The majority of new
   medicines are introduced initially in secondary care and prescribed by
   specialists. However, the reasons for relatively low precribing levels
   are poorly understood. This review explores the determinants of uptake
   of new medicines in secondary care.
   Methods: Nine electronic databases were searched covering the period
   1992-2006. Once the searches had been run, records were downloaded and
   those which evaluated uptake of new medicines in secondary care were
   identified. UK studies were of primary interest, although research
   conducted in other countries was also reviewed if relevant. With the
   exception of 'think pieces', eligibility was not limited by study
   design. Studies published in languages other than English were excluded
   from the review. Determinants of uptake in secondary care were
   classified using Bonair and Persson's typology for determinants of the
   diffusion of innovation.
   Results: Almost 1400 records were screened for eligibility, and 29
   studies were included in the review. Prescribing of new medicines in
   secondary care was found to be subject to a number of interacting
   influences. The support structures which exist within secondary care
   facilitate access to other colleagues and shape prescribing practices.
   Clinical trial investigators and physicians who sit on decision-making
   bodies such as Drug and Therapeutic Committees (DTCs) appear to have a
   special influence due to their proximity to their research and
   understanding of evidence base. Pharmaceutical representatives may also
   influence prescribing decisions through funding of meetings and academic
   detailing, but clinicians are wary of potential bias. Little evidence on
   the influence of patients upon prescribing decisions was identified. The
   impact of clinical guidelines has been variable. Some guidelines have
   significantly increased the uptake of new medicines, but others have had
   little discernible impact despite extensive dissemination. However given
   the increasing influence of the National Institute for Health and
   Clinical Excellence, guidelines may become more important. The impact of
   financial prescribing incentives on secondary care prescribing is
   unclear. Although cost and budget may influence hospital prescribing of
   new drugs, they are of secondary importance to the safety and
   effectiveness profile of the medicine. If a drug has a novel mechanism
   of action, or belongs to a class with few alternatives, clinicians are
   more likely to consider it favourably as a prescribing option.
   Conclusions: Although price does not appear to be a primary factor
   behind prescribing decision-making, in secondary care there has long
   been a historical need for formal purchasing decisions through the DTC,
   which differentiates it from primary care. This, in addition to
   increasing pressures for cost-effectiveness within the NHS means that
   cost will appear more frequently on clinician consciousness. As a
   result, guidelines are more likely to be implemented using the strong
   professional networks in existence within secondary care, and although
   the influence of patients has not been addressed by the literature, they
   are likely to have an increasing input into the prescribing decision,
   given the importance of patient involvement in current UK policy.

AB During COVID-19 emergency the majority of health structures in Europe
   saturated or nearly saturated their availabilities already in the first
   weeks of the epidemic period especially in some regions of Italy and
   Spain. The aim of this study is to analyse the efficiency in the
   management of hospital beds before the COVID-19 outbreak at regional
   level in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This analysis can indicate a
   reference point for future analysis on resource management in emergency
   periods and help hospital managers, emergency planners as well as policy
   makers to put in place a rapid and effective response to an emergency
   situation. The results of this study clearly underline that France and
   Germany could rely on the robust structural components of the hospital
   system, compared to Italy and Spain. Presumably, this might have had an
   impact on the efficacy in the management of the COVID-19 diffusion. In
   particular, the high availability of beds in the majority of the France
   regions paired with the low occupancy rate and high turnover interval
   led these regions to have a high number of available beds. Consider also
   that this country generally manages complex cases. A similar structural
   component is present in the German regions where the number of available
   beds is significantly higher than in the other countries. The impact of
   the COVID-19 was completely different in Italy and Spain that had to
   deal with a relevant large number of patients relying on a reduced
   number of both hospital beds and professionals. A further critical
   factor compared to France and Germany concerns the dissimilar
   distribution of cases across regions. Even if in these countries the
   hospital beds were efficiently managed, the concentration of
   hospitalized patients and the scarcity of beds have put pressure on the
   hospital systems.

AB Organ transplantation is widely practised worldwide. The expansion of
   organ transplantation has led to a critical shortage of organs and the
   development of the organ trade. Many patients travel to areas where
   organs are obtainable through commercial transactions. Although the
   international organ trade is regarded as an important health policy
   issue, its current state remains obscure because of scarce data and the
   lack of efforts to synthesize available data. This paper is an attempt
   to integrate information about the current international organ trade and
   create a tentative global picture based on a systematic review of 309
   media reports, journal articles and other documents. The international
   organ trade is described in terms of its forms, the organ-exporting
   countries, the organ-importing countries and its outcomes and

AB Among the numerous non-point sources of diffuse water pollution with
   nitrogen, agriculture is counted one of the main sources. The
   agricultural policies of the Agenda 2000 and a decoupling of direct
   payments for farmers from their production decisions are exemplarily
   evaluated as nitrogen reduction measures using the Regional Agricultural
   and Environmental Information System RAUMIS. The results show that until
   the target year 2010 the risk of diffuse pollution of water bodies with
   nitrogen is a regional problem in Germany. These problems are neither
   mitigated by the policies of Agenda 2000 nor by a decoupling of direct
   payments from production decisions of farmers. While total nitrogen
   surplus reduces considerably after a decoupling of direct payments due
   to decreases of land-use the nitrogen surplus on the remaining
   cultivated area increases resulting from structural changes. Granting
   the same amount of direct payments to farmers in both policy
   alternatives the agricultural sector income would be higher after a
   decoupling of direct payments opposed to the Agenda 2000 resulting from
   a more efficient allocation of inputs.

AB Advancing health equity and reducing disparities through evidence-based
   policy research requires the expertise, insights, and active
   participation of various policy stakeholders - particularly those
   representing vulnerable populations who may be disproportionately
   affected by such policies. Unfortunately, there are few sustainable
   settings for these diverse stakeholders to convene, share their
   knowledge, develop and execute research in a collaborative fashion, and
   effectively translate evidence-based findings. The development of a
   health policy-focused center supports the collaborative structure needed
   to present a unified, multi-disciplinary approach toward informing
   health policy. The Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center for Health
   Disparities Research (TCC) at Morehouse School of Medicine (U54MD008173)
   was funded in 2012 by the National Institute on Minority Health and
   Health Disparities (NIMHD) as an innovative approach for conducting
   health policy research and disseminating evidence-based science to
   diverse stakeholders. This article provides an overview of the research
   projects, pilot project programs, infrastructure cores, communications,
   and strategic dissemination activities supported by the TCC.

AB Public sector health systems that provide services to poor and
   marginalized populations in developing countries face great challenges.
   Change associated with health sector reform and structural adjustment
   often leaves these already-strained institutions with fewer resources
   and insufficient capacity to relieve health burdens.
   The Strategic Approach to Strengthening Reproductive Health Policies and
   Programs is a methodological innovation developed by the World Health
   Organization and its partners to help countries identify and prioritize
   their reproductive health service needs, test appropriate interventions,
   and scale up successful innovations to a subnational or national level.
   The participatory, interdisciplinary, and country-owned process can set
   in motion much-needed change.
   We describe key features of this approach, provide illustrations from
   country experiences, and use insights from the diffusion of innovation
   literature to explain the approach's dissemination and sustainability.

AB This investigation of the implementation of a positive youth development
   program (Project P.A.T.H.S.) was part of a large study undertaken
   comprehensively to explore how effective the Tier 1 Program was in
   practice and how the results can shed light on future developments. Case
   studies on randomly selected schools were conducted in order to examine
   the factors that influence the process and quality of implementation of
   the Tier 1 Program of the Project P.A.T.H.S. Through interviews with the
   school contact person and focus group interviews with the teachers, an
   integration of the findings of these studies showed that five factors
   related to the program, people, process, policy, and place (5 "P"s)
   facilitated the implementation process of the Tier 1 Program in the
   school. Based on the integrated findings of a randomly selected school,
   it was found that the school made use of the changes in the educational
   policy environment to facilitate school policy and structural changes,
   to pave the way for the success of the implementation of a new and
   "unfamiliar" curriculum. Overall, the quality of program implementation
   in the school was good and the program was well received by the program
   implementers. Implications of the present findings for future program
   implementation with reference to school administrative arrangements and
   implementation issues are also discussed.

AB To minimize negative environmental impact of livestock production,
   policy-makers face a challenge to design and implement more effective
   policy instruments for livestock farmers at different scales. This
   research builds an assessment framework on the basis of an agent-based
   model, named ANEM, to explore nutrient mitigation potentials of five
   policy instruments, using pig production in Zhongjiang county, southwest
   China, as the empirical filling. The effects of different policy
   scenarios are simulated and compared using four indicators and
   differentiating between small, medium and large scale pig farms.
   Technology standards, biogas subsidies and information provisioning
   prove to be the most effective policies, while pollution fees and manure
   markets fail to environmentally improve manure management in pig
   livestock farming. Medium-scale farms are the more relevant scale
   category for a more environmentally sound development of Chinese
   livestock production. A number of policy recommendations are formulated
   as conclusion, as well as some limitations and prospects of the
   simulations are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Funders of programs in public health and community health are
   increasingly concerned about the sustainability of changes they
   initiate. Despite a recent increase in :sustainability research and
   evaluation, this literature has not developed a widely used paradigm for
   conducting research that can accumulate into generalizable findings. We
   provide guidance for research and evaluation of health program
   sustainability, including definitions and types of sustainability,
   specifications and measurements of dependent variables, definitions of
   independent variables or factors that influence sustainability, and
   suggestions for designs for research and data collection. We suggest
   viewing sustainability research as a further stage in the translation or
   dissemination of research-based interventions into practice. This
   perspective emphasizes ongoing relationships with earlier stages of a
   broader diffusion framework, including adoption and implementation
   processes. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:2059-2067.

AB There are few examples of sustained nationally organised,
   evidence-informed clinical guidelines development processes in
   Sub-Saharan Africa. We describe the evolution of efforts from 2005 to
   2015 to support evidence-informed decision making to guide admission
   hospital care practices in Kenya. The approach to conduct reviews,
   present evidence, and structure and promote transparency of
   consensus-based procedures for making recommendations improved over four
   distinct rounds of policy making. Efforts to engage important voices
   extended from government and academia initially to include multiple
   professional associations, regulators and practitioners. More than 100
   people have been engaged in the decision-making process; an increasing
   number outside the research team has contributed to the conduct of
   systematic reviews, and 31 clinical policy recommendations has been
   developed. Recommendations were incorporated into clinical guideline
   booklets that have been widely disseminated with a popular knowledge and
   skills training course. Both helped translate evidence into practice. We
   contend that these efforts have helped improve the use of evidence to
   inform policy. The systematic reviews, Grading of Recommendations,
   Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approaches and evidence
   to decision-making process are well understood by clinicians, and the
   process has helped create a broad community engaged in evidence
   translation together with a social or professional norm to use evidence
   in paediatric care in Kenya. Specific sustained efforts should be made
   to support capacity and evidence-based decision making in other African
   settings and clinical disciplines.

AB A post-Millennium Development Goals agenda for health in Bangladesh
   should be defined to encourage a second generation of health-system
   innovations under the clarion call of universal health coverage. This
   agenda should draw on the experience of the first generation of
   innovations that underlie the country's impressive health achievements
   and creatively address future health challenges. Central to the reform
   process will be the development of a multipronged strategic approach
   that: responds to existing demands in a way that assures affordable,
   equitable, high-quality health care from a pluralistic health system;
   anticipates health-care needs in a period of rapid health and social
   transition; and addresses underlying structural issues that otherwise
   might hamper progress. A pragmatic reform agenda for achieving universal
   health coverage in Bangladesh should include development of a long-term
   national human resources policy and action plan, establishment of a
   national insurance system, building of an interoperable electronic
   health information system, investment to strengthen the capacity of the
   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and creation of a
   supraministerial council on health. Greater political, financial, and
   technical investment to implement this reform agenda offers the prospect
   of a stronger, more resilient, sustainable, and equitable health system.

   the left ventricular assist device (LVAD), while demonstrating the
   interaction of science, industry, politics, and economics in health
   care, suggests there are three critical points in the life cycle of a
   new technology. In the innovation phase, research support by the
   National Institutes of Health is critical. In the adoption phase, the
   crucial lever is the decision by the Medicare program to reimburse for
   the proposed new technology. Finally, in the dissemination phase,
   regular reevaluation of technology is essential.

AB Objective The aim was to describe how selected health research funding
   agencies active in low- and middle-income countries promote the
   translation of their funded research into policy and practice.
   Methods We conducted inductive analysis of semi-structured interviews
   with key informants from a purposive sample of 23 national and
   international funding agencies that fund health research in Brazil,
   Colombia, India, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand. We also
   surveyed web sites.
   Findings We found a commitment to knowledge translation in the mandate
   of 18 of 23 agencies. However, there was a lack of common terminology.
   Most of the activities were traditional efforts to disseminate to a
   broad audience, for example using web sites and publications, In
   addition, more than half (13 of 23) of the agencies encouraged
   linkage/exchange between researchers and potential users, and 6 of 23
   agencies described "pull" activities to-generate interest in research
   from decision-makers. One-third (9 of 23) of funding agencies described
   a mandate to enhance health equity through improving knowledge
   translation. Only 3 of 23 agencies were able to describe evaluation of
   knowledge translation activities. Furthermore, we found national funding
   agencies made greater knowledge translation efforts when compared to
   international agencies.
   Conclusion Funding agencies are engaged in a wide range of creative
   knowledge translation activities. They might consider their role as
   knowledge brokers, with an ability to promote research syntheses and a
   focus on health equity. There is an urgent need to evaluate the
   knowledge translation activities of funding agencies.

   water pollution in many urban areas. To address the pollution problems,
   several measures such as construction of sewerage systems and enactment
   of laws and regulations have been undertaken. Because of these measures,
   the water quality has been improved to some extent. However, many water
   quality concerns still remain and are attributed in part to diffuse
   pollution. In this paper, historical progress, present situation and
   future aspects of diffuse pollution problems in Japan are reviewed. It
   is noted that solving diffuse pollution problems will require a
   combination of several measures including application of conventional
   treatment technologies and natural purification systems, implementation
   of appropriate policy measures, and promotion of citizen participation.

AB This paper argues that substantive and sustainable population-wide
   improvements in physical activity can be achieved only through the large
   scale adoption and implementation of policies and practices that make
   being active the default choice and remaining inactive difficult.
   Meta-volition refers to the volition and collective agency of early
   adopter leaders who implement such changes in their own organizations to
   drive productivity and health improvements. Leaders, themselves, are
   motivated by strong incentives to accomplish their organizational
   missions. The meta-volition model (MVM) specifies a cascade of changes
   that may be sparked by structural integration of brief activity bouts
   into organizational routine across sectors and types of organizations.
   MVM builds upon inter-disciplinary social ecological change models and
   frameworks such as diffusion of innovations, social learning and social
   marketing. MVM is dynamic rather than static, integrating biological
   influences with psychological factors, and socio-cultural influences
   with organizational processes. The model proposes six levels of
   dissemination triggered by organizational marketing to early adopter
   leaders carried out by "sparkplugs," boisterous leaders in population
   physical activity promotion: initiating (leader-leader), catalyzing
   (organizational-individual), viral marketing
   (individual-organizational), accelerating
   (organizational-organizational), anchoring (organizational-community)
   and institutionalizing (community-individual). MVM embodies
   public-private partnership principles, a collective investment in the
   high cost of achieving and maintaining active lifestyles. (C) 2009

AB This paper puts health questions within the context of national
   development and industrial policy. It follows the idea of structuralist,
   Marxist and Schumpeterian approaches, in which industry and innovations
   form determining factors for the dynamism in capitalist economies and
   relative positions within the world economy. All countries that have
   developed and started to compete under better conditions with advanced
   countries have had an association between strong industry and an
   endogenous knowledge, learning and innovation base. However, in the
   field of health, this vision presents problems because business
   interests move according to the economic logic of profit rather than to
   meet health needs. The notion of the health-industrial complex is an
   attempt to provide a theoretical reference that enables linkage between
   two distinct types of logic: health and economic development. This study
   has sought to show, on the basis of foreign trade data, how disregard
   for the logic of health policy development has led to a situation of
   economic vulnerability in this sector, which may limit the objectives of
   universality, equality and comprehensiveness. Within this context, a
   cognitive and political break with these antagonistic visions that put
   health needs on one side and industrial needs on the other is proposed.
   A country that aims to reach a condition of development and independence
   requires strong innovative industries and an inclusive and universal
   health system, at the same time.

AB We present a model of dynamic monopoly pricing for a good that displays
   network effects. In contrast with the standard notion of a
   rational-expectations equilibrium, we model consumers as boundedly
   rational and unable either to pay immediate attention to each price
   change or to make accurate forecasts of the adoption of the network
   good. Our analysis shows that the seller's optimal price trajectory has
   the following structure: The price is low when the user base is below a
   target level, is high when the user base is above the target, and is set
   to keep the user base stationary once the target level has been
   attained. We show that this pricing policy is robust to a number of
   extensions, which include the product's user base evolving over time and
   consumers basing their choices on a mixture of a myopic and a "stubborn"
   expectation of adoption. Our results differ significantly from those
   that would be predicted by a model based on rational-expectations
   equilibrium and are more consistent with the pricing of network goods
   observed in practice.

AB Diffuse pollution problems involve numerous different organizations and
   this requires decision makers to involve different actors if they want
   to develop policies that have a chance of being implemented effectively.
   A first step in such interactive policy development would be to gain an
   overview of the different actors involved in diffuse pollution problems,
   as well as their views on the problem, their interests and their means
   to influence policy development and implementation. Dynamic Actor
   Network Analysis (DANA) offers a method that helps analysts in providing
   such an overview, and the use of this method is explored through its
   application to a case in the Dutch province of North Holland. The
   described case specifically focuses on the use of herbicides in public
   space and involves actors from regional water management authorities,
   municipalities and private sector users. An important finding is that
   there is an imbalance in the perceptions of actors that needs to be
   addressed by water management authorities. The paper concludes that DANA
   is a promising tool for offering new and useful insights to decision
   makers, although more practical experience! is needed to better assess
   the utility of this analysis tool.

AB Background. This study evaluated the extent to which school districts in
   Massachusetts adopted HIV education policies consistent with state
   education agency recommendations, and whether adoption of
   state-recommended policy language was associated with other core
   components of school-based HIV prevention programs such as staff
   development, curriculum, and implementation characteristics. Methods. A
   census of health coordinators (n = 251) and high school HIV teachers (n
   = 174) in randomly selected schools in Massachusetts were surveyed.
   Chi-squares and analysis of variance (ANOVAs) were used to analyze data.
   Results. Most districts' policies fully incorporated state-recommended
   language for training HIV teachers (62%), providing HIV education within
   comprehensive sexuality education (62%), and providing skills-based
   instruction (57%). Districts adopting state-recommended policies were
   significantly more likely to have trained more HIV teachers (82% vs. 59%
   of teachers trained; P < 0.001), provided HIV education to a greater
   percentage of students (90% vs. 50% of students educated; P < 0.001),
   and adopted research-based curricula (44% vs. 27%; P < 0.01). High
   school teachers who received training and those using research-based
   curricula covered more HIV prevention topics and used more skills-based
   instructional methods than those who did not receive training or did not
   use research-based curricula (P < 0.01). Conclusions. Results suggest
   that strong, state-level HIV prevention education policy recommendations
   can help shape local school health policy and, when adopted locally, can
   positively influence the reach and quality of HIV education. (C) 2004

   to increase the adoption of a tobacco prevention program. The adoption
   intervention followed a series of dissemination intervention strategies
   targeted at 128 school districts in Texas. Informed by Social Cognitive
   Theory, the intervention provided opportunities for districts to learn
   about and model themselves after 'successful' school districts that had
   adopted the program, and to see the potential for social reinforcement
   through the knowledge that the program had the potential to have an
   important influence on students' lives. The proportion of districts in
   the Intervention condition that adopted the program was significantly
   greater than in the Comparison condition (P < 0.001). Stepwise logistic
   regression indicated that the variables most closely related to adoption
   among intervention districts were teacher attitudes toward the
   innovation and organizational considerations of administrators,
   Recommendations for the development of effective strategies for the

   Methods. We collected survey data from 1683 (919 valid responses from a
   randomdigit-dialed survey and 764 valid responses from a Qualtrics
   panel) parents of public school students in Georgia in 2018.
   Results. Most parents reported that their child participated in fitness
   assessments at school, yet only 31% reported receiving results. If a
   child was identified as needing improvement, parents were significantly
   more likely to change the diet and exercise of both the child and the
   family.
   Conclusions. A state-level mandatory fitness assessment for children may
   be successful in state-level surveillance of fitness levels; parental
   awareness of the policy, receipt of the fitness assessment information,
   and action on receiving the screening information require more efforts
   in implementation.

   campaigns seeking to implement a tobacco control policy. An effective
   campaign is based in evidence that demonstrates why a policy should be
   implemented, and what the potential benefits are. Media advocacy is the
   process of disseminating information through the communications media
   where the aim is to effect: action, such as a change of policy, or to
   alter the public's view of an issue. Discussion focuses on: 1) the
   importance of, and methods for, collecting and communicating evidence
   and information to make it clear and usable for legislators, the media,
   and the public; and 2) the role of earned and paid media in advancing
   tobacco control issues. The discussion is made within the context of a

AB An emissions payment system for nitrogen in Swedish sewage treatment
   plants (STPS) was evaluated using a semi-empirical approach. The system
   was based on a tariff levied on each unit of nitrogen emitted by STPs,
   and profitable measures to reduce nitrogen emissions were identified for
   twenty municipal STPs. This was done through direct involvement with the
   plant personnel and the results were scaled up to cover all treatment
   plants larger than 2000 person equivalents in the Swedish tributary
   areas of the Kattegat and the Baltic Proper. The sum of costs and
   nitrogen reductions were compared with an assumed command-and-control
   regulation requiring all STPs to obtain 80% total nitrogen reduction in
   their effluents. Costs for the latter case were estimated using a
   database containing standard estimates for reduction costs by six
   specified measures. For both cases a total reduction target of 3000
   tonnes of nitrogen was set. We did not find that the emissions payment
   system was more efficient in terms of total reduction costs, although
   some practical and administrative advantages could be identified. Our
   results emphasize the need to evaluate the performance of policy
   instruments on a case-by-case basis since the theoretical efficiency is
   not always reflected in practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Innovative rare disease therapies and health technology assessment (HTA)
   share a lot of similarities. Both represent cases of interaction of
   epidemiology and health economics. Both are relatively new topics in
   public health practice. And both pose a lot of challenges to rare
   disease stakeholders who are currently looking for tools to support the
   timely access to innovative treatments while putting budget spending in
   order. This is why optimisation of assessment and appraisal of new rare
   disease therapies is a fundamental issue in rare disease health policy.
   Rare disease patients and caregivers expect prolonged life expectancy
   and improved quality of life and they perceive innovative health
   technologies as a rightful way to achieve these objectives.
   Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a structured,
   transparent approach to identify preferred alternatives by means of
   combined calculation of relative importance of different criteria and
   performance of the alternatives on these criteria. The labyrinth of
   competing interests and numerous stakeholders involved is why innovative
   rare disease health technologies make an excellent case study of the
   integration between HTA and MCDA. This kind of formalisation of
   decision-making is perceived as fair and legitimate, leading to a
   balance and agreement. MCDA provides a stage for a debate of policy
   priorities, health system specifics and societal attitudes, while also
   addressing the impact of rarity on all criteria and considerations.

   these underlying conditions, and measures the impact of implemented
   interventions. This article reviews the practice, theoretical
   principles, and evaluation evidence on focused deterrence strategies.
   Although more rigorous randomized studies are needed, the available
   empirical evidence suggests that these strategies generate noteworthy
   gun violence reduction impacts and should be part of a broader portfolio
   of violence prevention strategies available to policy makers and

   Organization's policies are usually developed after a debate has taken
   place on a particular health issue.  There has not yet been a debate on
   acupuncture.  This paper reviews WHO's efforts to produce a standard
   acupuncture nomenclature as a first step towards ensuring that a debate
   on acupuncture takes place in an atmosphere of greater understanding of
   the contribution that acupuncture can make in the delivery of health
   care.  Activities that the programme for traditional medicine hopes to
   implement in the coming years are outlined.

AB Societal responses to crises require coordination at multiple levels of
   organization. Exploring early efforts to contain COVID-19 in the U.S.,
   we argue that local governments can act to ensure systemic resilience
   and recovery when higher-level governments fail to do so. Event history
   analyses show that large, more urban areas experience COVID-19 more
   intensely due to high population density and denser socioeconomic
   networks. But metropolitan counties were also among the first to adopt
   shelter-in-place orders. Analyzing the statistical predictors of when
   counties moved before their states, we find that the hierarchy of
   counties by size and economic integration matters for the timing of
   orders, where both factors predict earlier shelter-in-place orders. In
   line with sociological theories of urban governance, we also find
   evidence of an important governance dimension to the timing of orders.
   Liberal counties in conservative states were more than twice as likely
   to adopt a policy and implement one earlier in the pandemic, suggesting
   that tensions about how to resolve collective governance problems are
   important in the socio-temporal dynamic of responses to COVID-19. We
   explain this behavior as a substitution effect in which more urban local
   governments, driven by risk and necessity, step up into the action
   vacuum left by higher levels of government and become national policy
   leaders and innovators.

AB Objective To investigate and compare seven types of injection devices
   for their risks of iatrogenic transmission of bloodborne pathogens and
   their economic costs in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods Risk assumptions for each device and cost models were
   constructed to estimate the number of new hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections resulting from
   patient-to-patient, patient-to-health care worker, and
   patient-to-community transmission. Costs of device purchase and usage
   were derived from the literature, while costs of direct medical care and
   lost productivity from HBV and HIV disease were based on data collected
   in 1999 in Cote d'lvoire, Ghana, and Uganda. Multivariate sensitivity
   analyses using Monte Carlo simulation characterized uncertainties in
   model parameters. Costs were summed from both the societal and health
   care system payer's perspectives.
   Findings Resterilizable and disposable needles and syringes had the
   highest overall costs for device purchase, usage, and iatrogenic
   disease: median US$ 26.77 and US$ 25.29, respectively, per injection
   from the societal perspective. Disposable-cartridge jet injectors and
   automatic needle-shielding syringes had the lowest costs, US$ 0.36 and
   US$ 0.80, respectively. Reusable-nozzle jet injectors and auto-disable
   needle and syringes were intermediate, at US$ 0.80 and US$ 0.91,
   respectively, per injection.
   Conclusion Despite their nominal purchase and usage costs, conventional
   needles and syringes carry a hidden but huge burden of iatrogenic
   disease. Alternative injection devices for the millions of injections
   administered annually in sub-Saharan Africa would be of value and should
   be considered by policy-makers in procurement decisions.

AB Background In 2008, the Healthy Community Challenge Fund commissioned
   nine 'healthy towns' in England to implement and evaluate
   community-based environmental interventions to prevent obesity. This
   paper examines the role of evidence in informing intervention
   development, innovation and the potential for programmes to contribute
   to the evidence base on the effectiveness of interventions that tackle
   population obesity.
   Method Twenty qualitative interviews with local programme stakeholders
   and national policy actors were conducted. Interview transcripts were
   coded and thematically analysed. Initial analyses were guided by
   research questions regarding the nature and role of evidence in the
   development and implementation of the healthy towns programme and the
   capacity for evidence generation to inform future intervention design,
   policy and practice.
   Findings Stakeholders relied on local anecdotal and observational
   evidence to guide programme development. While the programme was
   considered an opportunity to trial new and innovative approaches, the
   requirement to predict likely health impacts and adopt evidence-based
   practice was viewed contradictory to this aim.
   Stakeholders believed there were missed opportunities to add to the
   existing empirical evidence base due to a lack of clarity and planning,
   particularly around timing, in local and national evaluations.
   Conclusions A strong emphasis on relying on existing evidence-based
   practice and producing positive impacts and outcomes may have impeded
   the opportunity to implement truly innovative programmes because of fear
   of failure. Building more time for development, implementation and
   evaluation into future initiatives would maximise the use and generation
   of robust and relevant evidence for public health policy and practice.

   reveals that while the Act contains some positive features, it
   represents a poor deal for Americans on balance that could result in the

AB Economic growth in modern-day world get attention primarily through
   innovation and higher productivity, which places technology and
   knowledge at the core of the issue on economic policy. In this regard,
   information and communication technology (ICT) has a unique place for
   offering the potential to improve efficiency, promote the sharing of
   knowledge, and improve innovation leading to an overall change in social
   and human development processes around the globe. This study examines
   the role of ICT and economic growth on human development. A family of
   econometric series robust to cross-sectional dependence is applied for a
   panel of five selected South Asian countries over 1990-2016. The ICT in
   the study were measured through mobile phone and internet penetration.
   The results of Driscoll-Kraay standard errors algorithm suggest that
   mobile phone usage promotes human development, whereas internet usage
   does not seem to do so. Apart from it, its economic growth does
   contribute to the promotion of human development. Policy implications
   are required in the direction for internet usage to produce its role in
   human development.

AB During the past decade, screening tests using computed tomography (CT)
   have disseminated into practice and been marketed to patients despite
   neither conclusive evidence nor professional agreement about their
   efficacy and cost-effectiveness at the population level. This phenomenon
   raises questions about physicians' professional roles and
   responsibilities within the setting of medical innovation, as well as
   the appropriate scope of patient autonomy and access to unproven
   screening technology. This article explores how physicians ought to
   respond when new screening examinations that lack conclusive evidence of
   overall population benefit emerge in the marketplace and are requested
   by individual patients. To this end, the article considers the nature of
   evidence and how it influences decision-making for screening at both the
   public policy and individual patient levels. We distinguish medical and
   ethical differences between screening recommended for a population and
   screening considered on an individual patient basis. Finally, we discuss
   specific cases to explore how evidence, patient risk factors and
   preferences, and physician judgment ought to balance when making
   individual patient screening decisions.

AB History confirms that while technological innovations can bring many
   benefits, they can also cause much human suffering, environmental
   degradation and economic costs. But are we repeating history with new
   and emerging chemical and technological products? In preparation for
   volume 2 of 'Late Lessons from Early Warnings' (European Environment
   Agency, 2013), two analyses were carried out to help answer this
   question. A bibliometric analysis of research articles in 78
   environmental, health and safety (EHS) journals revealed that most
   focused on well-known rather than on newly emerging chemicals. We
   suggest that this 'scientific inertia' is due to the scientific
   requirement for high levels of proof via well replicated studies; the
   need to publish quickly; the use of existing intellectual and
   technological resources; and the conservative approach of many reviewers
   and research funders. The second analysis found that since 1996 the
   funding of EHS research represented just 0.6% of the overall funding of
   research and technological development (RTD). Compared with RTD funding,
   EHS research funding for information and communication technologies,
   nanotechnology and biotechnology was 0.09%, 2.3% and 4% of total
   research, respectively. The low EHS research ratio seems to be an
   unintended consequence of disparate funding decisions; technological
   optimism; a priori assertions of safety; collective hubris; and myopia.
   In light of the history of past technological risks, where EHS research
   was too little and too late, we suggest that it would be prudent to
   devote some 5-15% of RTD on EHS research to anticipate and minimise
   potential hazards while maximising the commercial longevity of emerging
   technologies.

AB Background: The electronic exchange of health records has been a notable
   topic in recent years in the effort to improve the quality of healthcare
   delivery and reduce administrative burden. Interviews and documents from
   stakeholders in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care, and HIV
   information technology were collected between November 2004 through
   March 2005 to conduct a qualitative policy analysis on the adoption of
   an electronic health record (EHR) system among HIV care providers in
   North Carolina and South Carolina.
   Method: Interview data on the current state of EHR use were collected in
   February through June 2008. The case study analysis included
   description, categorical aggregation, and naturalistic generalization.
   Results: Naturalistic generalizations that emerged were (1) state-level
   policies can have a significant effect on successful adoption of EHRs;
   (2) state-level champions are integral to cross-sectoral,
   multi-institutional EHR adoption; (3) voluntary and mandatory adoption
   strategies can lead to successful cross-sectoral, multi-institutional
   EHR implementation.
   Conclusion: State health departments can play an integral part in the
   successful implementation of EHR systems.

AB Background. Worksite initiatives to promote increased consumption of
   fruits and vegetables include a wide range of programs. Some initiatives
   focus on the physical and informational environments, with the dual aim
   of increasing the availability of healthful food options and providing
   education and support through point-of-choice labeling and signage.
   Methods. Authors reviewed recent literature on comprehensive worksite
   health promotion programs that have addressed some type of
   environmental/organizational intervention to increase fruit/vegetable
   consumption.
   Results. This review revealed that environmental/organizational
   initiatives rely on management commitment, supervisory support, and
   supportive organizational structures to sustain policy efforts over
   time. Program effectiveness is enhanced when they are based on social
   ecological approaches; include worker participation in program planning
   and implementation (e.g. employee advisory boards and peer-delivered
   interventions); address multiple (vs. single) risk factors for change;
   and integrate workers' broader social context (e.g. families,
   neighborhoods, etc.).
   Conclusions. Priorities for future worksite-based interventions include
   identifying and reducing barriers to organizational and environmental
   change, addressing social disparities in fruit and vegetable
   consumption, addressing social contextual factors driving behaviors, and
   building expanded networks of community partnerships. Future research is
   needed to identify key policy and program components that will yield
   meaningful increases in fruit and vegetable consumption;
   bartiers/facilitators of organizational and environmental change within
   worksites; effective community-based participatory methods; and methods
   to disseminate cost-effective interventions for all worksites. (C) 2004

AB Background: Ready access to reliable data is essential to support
   decision-making in patient care planning and delivery. Health
   information exchange (HIE), which is fundamental to achieve this, is
   currently limited in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
   reflecting the lack of prioritization of this issue and the many

   deployment strategies for HIE in Pakistan. Method: Data collection
   comprised interviews with purposefully selected groups of stakeholders
   across Pakistan, field notes, and a critical review of key national and
   international policy documents. Results: We identified reports of small
   pockets of effective HIE existing mainly in private hospitals, but in a
   patchy and fragmented form overall. Many problems were attributed to the
   absence of effective HIE, these ranging from 'delays in retrieving
   records' to contributing to 'the increase in antibiotic resistance'. The
   mindset of policymakers, poor infrastructure, lack of finance, training
   and data interoperability, and health-care providers' resistance to
   recording consultations due to poor documentation skills and concerns
   about liability considerations were highlighted as major barriers to
   HIE. Sharing regional health information with international
   organizations was perceived by some participants to increase the risk of
   regional espionage. A clear government policy directive for
   evidence-based decision-making, constant supply of electricity,
   training, widespread adoption of common data standards and public
   pressure to adopt mobile technology frameworks were identified as
   potential facilitators of HIE. Conclusion: HIE can be achieved with the
   support of the federal and provincial governments coupled with financial
   and technical backing from international donor organizations. The
   transition to HIE is likely to be very dependent on improving governance
   capabilities and bolstering the informatics skill-base in Pakistan and
   indeed many other LMICs.

AB Urban ecosystems are increasingly influenced by residential yard care
   decisions. This had led researchers to focus on homeowner education
   programs when it comes to yard care. Typically, the success of programs
   designed to influence yard care is based on whether the target subject
   changes his or her behavior in a more environmentally conscious manner.
   This threshold, however, fails to consider if individuals share this
   information with their friends and neighbors, thus having a possible
   spillover effect. In this paper, we focus on the transmission of new
   lawn management information among neighbors and consider (1) if
   individuals discuss information they learned in a short-term educational
   program, (2) what factors are associated with diffusion, (3) what
   information individuals share, and (4) what barriers to transmission
   exist. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, we used data from
   a mailed survey, group discussions, and mailed information exchanges.
   Results indicate that best management practices for yards can diffuse
   through the neighborhood (approximately 34 % shared information with
   their neighbors in a one-month period). In addition, factors such as (1)
   attending a group discussion, 2) individual social connectedness, (3)
   length of home ownership, and (4) the presence of children in the
   household were found to be positively related to increased sharing of
   information. Also, for lawns, the content of information shared tended
   to be about increasing grass height and reducing fertilizer
   applications. Finally, we find barriers to sharing ideas based on
   spatial, temporal, or perception factors but overcoming some of these
   barriers is possible.

AB Objective: To describe growth and regional variation in the use of
   spirometry (flow studies) in Ontario.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of Ontario Health Insurance Pan (OHIP)
   fee-for-service billing data for spirometry from the 1989-90 to 1994-95
   fiscal years.
   Setting: Physicians' office practices in Ontario.
   Outcome measures: Number of flow studies and associated expenditures,
   number and specialty of physicians performing flow studies and the
   distribution of their billings, number of studies per capita by age
   group of patients, expenditures by region and measures of variation
   among regions.
   Results: In 1994-95, $14.13 million was spent on flow studies in
   Ontario. This expenditure increased by 36.9% from 1989-90 to 1994-95,
   exceeding the overall growth rate of 20.8% for all expenditures under
   OHIP. Expenditure growth was driven by an increase in the number of
   physicians performing spirometry rather than a higher volume of services
   performed per physician. The substitution of flow-volume loops, for
   which the fee is higher, for simple spirograms also contributed to
   expenditure growth. There were wide regional variations in spirometry
   utilization. A small number of general practitioners and family
   physicians accounted for much of the regional variation.
   Conclusions: The rapid growth in spirometry utilization may stem from
   the diffusion of inexpensive spirometers in physicians' offices and from
   increased awareness of guidelines promoting the use of flow
   measurements, However, the wide regional variation in utilization may
   indicate either incomplete implementation of spirometry guidelines or
   lack of direction on the appropriate frequency of spirometry use.
   Clearer, evidence-based guidelines and an implementation strategy are
   needed. Also required is further study of possible inadequate access to
   spirometry in low-use regions and inappropriate use in high-use regions,
   where spirometry use is concentrated among a small number of physicians.

AB The National Tuberculosis Prevalence Survey done in 1997 (1997 NPS)
   revealed that the magnitude of tuberculosis in the Philippines hardly
   declined between 1982 and 1997. In 1996, the National TB Control Program
   (NTP) adopted the directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS)
   strategy. By the end of 2001, more than 90% of the population have
   access to it. Cohort analysis revealed good treatment outcomes. Despite
   this improvement in the public sector, there is a concern that the
   epidemiological impact of DOTS will be limited due to the
   non-participation of the private practitioners, a major stakeholder.
   Public-private sector collaboration in TB control was strengthened since
   the Philippine Coalition Against TB (Phi[CAT) was organized in 1994.
   There are four areas of collaboration, namely, policy development,
   advocacy and information dissemination, training and research and
   service delivery. Four models of public-private mix (PPM) DOTS in
   service delivery were developed. The private DOTS clinics provide the
   space, staff and operational funds while the Department of Health (DOH)
   provided technical assistance, anti-TB drugs, laboratory supplies and
   forms. Evaluation showed that PPM in TB control is feasible with good
   results. The major challenge is to replicate and institutionalize the
   PPM DOTS. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Background: Evidence-based guidelines for promoting physical activity
   have been produced, yet sparse information exists on the dissemination
   of effective interventions. The purpose of this study was to better
   understand the dissemination of physical activity interventions across
   the United States, focusing particularly on evidence-based guidelines.
   Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the U.S. that was
   organized around a modified version of the diffusion of innovations
   theory.
   Setting/Participants: Respondents (n=49) were the physical activity
   contact person (e.g., program administrator tor, health educator) in
   each state or territorial health department.
   Main Outcome Measures: Seven specific programs and policies relating to
   physical activity intervention were examined as dependent variables.
   Five additional domains-organizational climate, aware: ness, adoption,
   implementation, and maintenance-framed a set of independent variables.
   Results: The most important factor related to decision making was the
   availability of adequate resources. Most respondents (89.8%) were aware
   of evidence-based guidelines to promote physical activity. However, less
   than half of the respondents (41%) had the authority to implement
   evidence-based programs and policies. A minority of respondents reported
   having support from their state governor (35.4%) or from most of their
   state legislators (21.3%). Several key factors were associated with the
   adoption of evidence-based interventions, including the presence of
   state funding for physical activity, whether the respondent participated
   in moderate physical activity, presence of adequate staffing, and
   presence of a supportive state legislature.
   Conclusions: Awareness of the importance of promoting physical activity
   is relatively high in state and territorial health departments; however,
   the levels of internal support within the health department appear to
   outweigh any outside support from elected officials.

AB Epidemic, infectious, diseases affect a large number of individuals
   across developing as well as developed countries. With reference to some
   very simple diffusion models, in this paper we consider how available
   economic resources could be optimally allocated by health authorities to
   mitigate, possibly eradicate, the disease. Optimality was defined as the
   minimization of the long run number of infected people. The main goal of
   the work has been to introduce a methodology for deciding if it would be
   best to concentrate resources to prevent contact between individuals and
   with an external source, or to develop a new treatment for curing the
   disease, or both. The analysis suggests that this depends on the cost
   functions, that is the available technology, for controlling the
   relevant parameters underlying the epidemics as well as on the available
   financial resources. In the case of the recent Ebola outbreak, the
   suggestions of the model have been consistent with the policies adopted.

AB In 1991 the Institute of Medicine issued a report on improving patient
   records which has proven to be a landmark for the many individuals and
   institutions involved in the development of computer-based patient
   records (CPRs). The report called Computer-based Patient Records: An
   Essential Technology for Health Care, recommended that CPRs become the
   primary form for patient records, and urged widespread implementation of
   CPRs within a decade. It also provides a framework for reviewing the
   current status of CPRs. In reviewing progress that has been made toward
   CPRs since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report was released, it is
   useful to look beyond the IOM report's major focus on efforts in the USA
   and include international activities related to CPR development and
   implementation. Looking forward, CPR efforts are likely to be expedited
   through greater collaboration.

AB A review is presented here of the research carried out, by a group
   including the authors, on the mathematical analysis of epidemic systems.
   Particular attention is paid to recent analysis of optimal control
   problems related to spatially structured epidemics driven by
   environmental pollution. A relevant problem, related to the possible
   eradication of the epidemic, is the so called zero stabilization. In a
   series of papers, necessary conditions, and sufficient conditions of
   stabilizability have been obtained. It has been proved that it is
   possible to diminish exponentially the epidemic process, in the whole
   habitat, just by reducing the concentration of the pollutant in a
   nonempty and sufficiently large subset of the spatial domain. The
   stabilizability with a feedback control of harvesting type is related to
   the magnitude of the principal eigen-value of a certain operator. The
   problem of finding the optimal position (by translation) of the support
   of the feedback stabilizing control is faced, in order to minimize both
   the infected population and the pollutant at a certain finite time.

   challenges of promoting physical activity. With the 2004 release of the
   World Health Organization Global Strategy for Diet and Physical
   Activity, risk factor reduction and noncommunicable disease control are
   of global health interest. A six-step framework is proposed for
   understanding the attributes of successful international dissemination.
   These include the development of clear and evidence based resources or
   innovations, defining the target audience, selecting communication
   channels, engaging decision makers, and developing evaluation frameworks
   around dissemination. Four case studies to illustrate aspects of the
   framework are presented: (1) learning from dissemination of effective
   tobacco control initiatives, (2) the experience of developing global
   measures and surveillance systems for physical activity, (3) case stud),
   of disseminating the Agita program-an effective community wide
   intervention, and (4) disseminating the World Health Organization Global
   Strategy on Diet and Physical Activity. Substantial similarities across
   the experiences described in these case studies suggest underlying
   common themes for international dissemination, but developing a stronger
   evidence base for dissemination efforts remains a research priority.

   substantial improvements in female educational attainment over the last
   fifty years and a strong relationship between education and the
   demographic outcomes. Each successive increment in education is
   associated with declines in the marriage rate, increased contraceptive
   use, and lower fertility. Education accounts for some of the changes
   over time in the demographic outcomes, but the pattern varies by
   outcome, time period, and geographic area. In support of the social

   in reproductive behavior are reduced as the level of development
   increases and societies pass through their demographic transition.

AB With the decline in public budgets for agricultural extension support,
   ties between members of farmer groups are becoming more important to
   facilitate information transfer about agroforestry. This paper examines
   the role of social network ties in predicting organizational leadership
   in an agroforestry-based farmer group. Using social network data derived
   from interviews with members of farming groups based in the Ayeyarwady
   Delta of Myanmar, we established a positive relationship between
   advice-seeking ties and organizational leadership. In other words,
   farmers who were highly sought for agroforestry advice were more likely
   to be elected as leaders of the farmer group. Results show the frequency
   of interactions through advice-seeking ties also had a positive
   influence on the probability of farmers holding leadership positions. We
   found a core-periphery structure for the advice networks, whereby farmer
   leaders were overrepresented at the network core. Interestingly, general
   members of the farmer group were also in the core of the core-periphery
   structure, suggesting that engaging with farmers without leadership
   roles can also effectively disseminate agroforestry information to
   peripheral farmers. We conclude that farmer groups are valuable in
   agroforestry adoption and persistence and further analyses of formal
   leadership structures are needed to support more transparent and
   accountable governance.

AB Successful integration of nutrition interventions into large-scale
   development programmes from nutrition-relevant sectors, such as
   agriculture, can address critical underlying determinants of
   undernutrition and enhance the coverage and effectiveness of on-going
   nutrition-specific activities. However, evidence on how this can be done
   is limited. This study examines the feasibility of delivering maternal,
   infant, and young child nutrition behaviour change communication through
   an innovative agricultural extension programme serving nutritionally
   vulnerable groups in rural India. The existing agriculture programme
   involves participatory production of low-cost videos promoting best
   practices and broad dissemination through village-level women's
   self-help groups. For the nutrition intervention, 10 videos promoting
   specific maternal, infant, and young child nutrition practices were
   produced and disseminated in 30 villages. A range of methods was used to
   collect data, including in-depth interviews with project staff,
   frontline health workers, and self-help group members and their
   families; structured observations of mediated video dissemination
   sessions; nutrition knowledge tests with project staff and self-help
   group members; and a social network questionnaire to assess diffusion of
   promoted nutrition messages. We found the nutrition intervention to be
   well-received by rural communities and viewed as complementary to
   existing frontline health services. However, compared to agriculture,
   nutrition content required more time, creativity, and technical support
   to develop and deliver. Experimentation with promoted nutrition
   behaviours was high, but sharing of information from the videos with
   non-viewers was limited. Key lessons learned include the benefits of and
   need for collaboration with existing health services; continued
   technical support for implementing partners; engagement with local
   cultural norms and beliefs; empowerment of women's group members to
   champion nutrition; and enhancement of message diffusion mechanisms to
   reach pregnant women and mothers of young children at scale.
   Understanding the experience of developing and delivering this
   intervention will benefit the design of new nutrition interventions
   which seek to leverage agriculture platforms.

   including poverty, malnutrition, poor sanitation, and infectious
   diseases. Worldwide, the burden of environmental disease is much higher
   for children than adults, especially in young children under 5 years of
   age. Quantification of the burden of diseases attributable to
   environment shows that environmental risk factors can contribute to more
   than one-third of the disease burden in children, a fraction of disease
   that could be prevented. Children are often exposed to multiple
   environmental threats combined with other behavioral, social, and
   economic risk factors. Many of the environmental health risk factors are
   shared among children's home, school, and community. Therefore, an
   integrated approach should be considered in order to create healthy
   environments for children. The promotion of safe environments for
   children has to involve decision makers, nongovernmental organizations
   (NGOs), families, and various sectors including health, education,
   housing, environment, agriculture, industry, transport, and energy.
   Multiple initiatives have been proposed from collection, evaluation, and
   dissemination of information on children's health and the potential
   environmental threats to research, monitoring, risk assessment, and
   policies to improve the environmental conditions and ultimately
   children's growth and development.

AB Since renewable energy has the paramount importance of achieving
   environmental sustainability, developing countries like Pakistan have
   been facing numerous renewable energy generation (REG) development
   challenges. Thus, the REG development in any country can be attributed
   to its crucial drivers as well as crucial barriers. This work aims to
   identify crucial influence factors of REG development by conducting
   multi-facet content analysis as well as partial least square-based
   structural equation modeling analysis on data collected through a
   questionnaire survey. It has been conducted based on academicians from
   four Pakistani universities as well as professionals from Islamabad
   Electric Supply Company. The key outcomes are as follows: First, through
   multi-facet content analysis, ten crucial influence factors are
   identified. Among those factors, lack of good governance, renewable
   energy adaptation, and governmental energy policies are revealed to be
   the crucial barriers to REG development, whereas endowed resources,
   power production approach, renewable energy demand, investment
   environment for renewable energy projects, economic returns of renewable
   energy projects, environmental effects, and public acceptance are found
   to be the crucial drivers of REG development. Based on relative
   significance, the lack of good governance is unveiled to be the most
   significant factor, while environmental effects is found to be the least
   significant one. Moreover, among the drivers of REG development, public
   acceptance is found to be the prime contributor. At the same time, among
   crucial barriers, lack of good governance has shown the largest
   contribution to REG development.

AB Innovation plays an increasingly important role in health care, partly
   because it is responsible for a significant share of national investment
   in research and development, and partly because of its industrial and
   service provision base, which provides a conduit to future technology.
   The relationship between health care and development is also
   strengthened as a result of the leading role of health care in
   generating innovation. Nevertheless, Brazil's health care production
   base is persistently weak, hindering both universal provision of health
   care services and international competitiveness. This article, based on
   the theoretical framework of Political Economy and innovation systems,
   has sought to identify variables in subnational contexts that influence
   the dynamic of innovation generation in health care. To this end, the
   theoretical approach used lies on the assumption that innovation is a
   contextualized social process and that the production base in healthcare
   will remain weak if new variables involved in the dynamic of innovation
   are not taken into account.

AB In 1997, a compulsory notification system for waterborne outbreaks was
   introduced in Finland. The main aim of this notification is to obtain
   immediate information on suspected waterborne outbreaks in order to
   restrict and manage the outbreak promptly. During the past ten years,
   there have been 67 waterborne outbreaks in Finland, mainly associated
   with small groundwater supplies or private wells. The number of reported
   waterborne outbreaks has increased since the launch of the notification
   system indicating that the threshold limit of outbreak detection has
   most probably decreased. The number of cases of illness has fulfilled
   the national health target, which is below 0.01% of the population, but
   more action is still needed to ensure the production of safe drinking
   water under all circumstances. Ten years accumulation of knowledge on
   outbreaks has revealed that a compulsory notification system is an
   effective tool to gather information on waterborne outbreaks. The system
   has also increased awareness of possible problems related to the quality
   of drinking water. This article summarises management and legislative
   actions and policy measures taken so far in Finland to reduce the number
   of outbreaks and cases of illness related to them.

AB This study deals with the roles of pioneers or early adopters in a
   rainwater harvesting technology dissemination process in arsenic and
   water salinity affected communities in coastal Bangladesh. The
   dissemination of such innovative technologies has long been advocated
   for making disaster resilient communities, but how to disseminate these
   innovations has rarely been addressed, except heuristic studies limited
   to analyzing the cognitive factors of preparedness. We argue that
   identifying and characterizing pioneer adopters is critical to promote
   innovative disaster preventive technologies. Because pioneers take the
   risk to adopt at a time when only limited information of the innovation
   is available, and, based on their firsthand experience, other members
   can make prudent adoption decisions. By using the social network
   threshold model, we show that just as there are adopters at the macro or
   regional level, there are adopters at the micro or local level, and they
   have the most critical roles, as catalysts to disseminate disaster
   preventive technologies among the population. We also argue that
   cosmopolitaness and level of education characterize the pioneers better,
   rather than their income, risk awareness, and other personal features.
   Some policy options related to the findings are also discussed.

AB Public health decision-making is critically dependent on the timely
   availability of sound data. The role of health information systems is to
   generate, analyse and disseminate such data. In practice, health
   information systems rarely function systematically. The products of
   historical, social and economic forces, they are complex, fragmented and
   unresponsive to needs. International donors in health are largely
   responsible for the problem, having prioritized urgent needs for data
   over longer-term country capacity-building. The result is painfully
   apparent in the inability of most countries to generate the data needed
   to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Solutions
   to the problem must be comprehensive; money alone is likely to be
   insufficient unless accompanied by sustained support to country systems
   development coupled with greater donor accountability and allocation of
   responsibilities. The Health Metrics Network, a global collaboration in
   the making, is intended to help bring such solutions to the countries
   most in need.

AB Conflicts of interest exist when an arrangement potentially exerts
   inappropriate influence on decision making or professional judgment, or
   is perceived to do so, and can thus damage the public trust and
   undermine the integrity of those decisions. Concerns regarding financial
   conflicts of interest in the medical arena have reached their height as
   of late, given that physicians now function in a milieu of complex and
   delicate relationships with pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical
   device industries. Even when such relationships do not correlate with
   actual compromise of judgment or patient care, it threatens the
   credibility of both the health care professional and the institution
   because of the social perception of the effect of these relationships.
   Although most institutions in the Western world set forth a code of
   ethics and conflict-of-interest policies to be followed under threat of
   termination, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) presents itself as
   a unique environment in which conflicts of interest are subject to
   governmental laws, violation of which may not only result in
   employment-related discipline, but may be sanctioned by civil and
   criminal penalties. Moreover, these provisions are developed by a
   national authoritative organization rather than being
   institution-specific guidelines. Given that many academic physicians
   working within the VHA may also have a component of their practice in a
   University setting, it becomes important to understand the differences
   in policy between these contexts so as not to threaten the public trust
   in the veracity of decisions made and, therefore, maintain the integrity
   of the relationship between physician and patient. This article will
   review aspects of conflict-of-interest policies in the realm of
   research, financial relationships, foreign travel, and vendor
   contracting that are particular to the VHA and make it a unique
   environment to function in as a physician and scientist. (J Vase Surg

AB Rigorous impact evaluations on agricultural interventions in the
   developing world have proliferated in research of recent years. Whereas
   increased care in causal identification in such analyses is beneficial
   and has improved the quality of research in this field, much of the
   literature still fails to investigate the costs needed to achieve any
   benefits identified. Such understanding, however, would be crucial for
   drawing policy and programmatic conclusions from the research and for
   informing the allocation of public investments. Cost-effectiveness
   analysis (CEA) subjects both the cost side and the effects side of
   agricultural and rural interventions to technical scrutiny and unifies
   both sides in order to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of
   different modalities of a programme, of efforts to reach different
   target groups, or of efforts to achieve different outcomes. CEAs, while
   present in the health and education sectors, remain rare in agricultural
   and rural development research. This study contributes to filling the
   knowledge gap by conducting CEAs in a particular type of programmatic
   work in the agricultural sector-namely, interventions conducted as field
   experiments that bring a gender lens to community-based advisory
   services in African rural areas. Specifically, we consider two such
   programmes-one in Mozambique in which such advisory services aim to
   improve sustainable land management (SLM) practices in agricultural
   production, and the other in Tanzania to advise farmers on their land
   rights. Using CEA methods combined with econometric analysis based on
   randomised controlled trials, we find that the gendered modality is
   consistently more cost-effective than the basic modality when
   considering varied outcomes and target groups. However, for any given
   modality, it is more cost-effective to improve outcomes for men than for
   women. The structure of costs in the agricultural extension programme
   further allowed for a simulation of how cost-effectiveness would change
   if the programme were scaled up geographically. The results show that
   expansion of the basic modality of the SLM programme leads to
   improvements in cost-effectiveness, while the gendered modality displays
   nonlinear changes in cost-effectiveness along the expansion path, first
   worsening with initial scale-up and subsequently improving with further
   expansion.

   technologies are fundamental both to expand the access and to adapt the
   system to the population's needs. However, the generation of health
   innovation is not based solely on sanitary demands and conditioning
   factors; on the contrary, it often reflects a trajectory of development
   and the interests of restricted groups in society. These issues need to
   be taken into consideration both in the analysis of the complexity of
   the health dimensions and in the investigation of the potential and
   challenges for the establishment of a virtuous innovative dynamics for

AB Despite significant gains by pediatric collaborative improvement
   networks, the overall US system of chronic illness care does not work
   well. A new paradigm is needed: a Collaborative Chronic Care Network
   (C3N). A C3N is a network-based production system that harnesses the
   collective intelligence of patients, clinicians, and researchers and
   distributes the production of knowledge, information, and know-how over
   large groups of people, dramatically accelerating the discovery process.
   A C3N is a platform of "operating systems" on which interconnected
   processes and interventions are designed, tested, and implemented. The
   social operating system is facilitated by community building, engaging
   all stakeholders and their expertise, and providing multiple ways to
   participate. Standard progress measures and a robust information
   technology infrastructure enable the technical operating system to
   reduce unwanted variation and adopt advances more rapidly. A structured
   approach to innovation design provides a scientific operating system or
   "laboratory" for what works and how to make it work. Data support
   testing and research on multiple levels: comparative effectiveness
   research for populations, evaluating care delivery processes at the care
   center level, and N-of-1 trials and other methods to select the best
   treatment of individual patient circumstances. Methods to reduce
   transactional costs to participate include a Federated IRB Model in
   which centers rely on a protocol approved at 1 central institutional
   review board and a "commons framework" for organizational copyright and
   intellectual property concerns. A fully realized C3N represents a
   discontinuous leap to a self-developing learning health system capable
   of producing a qualitatively different approach to improving health.

   contribute to face them, especially those owing to municipal solid waste
   (MSW) management. Curitiba, a Brazilian municipality known for its
   innovative initiatives towards sustainability. Despite a long tradition
   in recycling inert waste, MSW system struggles to promote composting
   even considering a decade in force national law. Decentralised
   composting through the Urban Agriculture Program (UAP) is the city's
   strategy to tackle this struggle. This strategy faces difficulties as,
   even if urban agriculture facilities seem to be a promising context,
   closing the agricultural loop within the city bounds was not possible in
   the 24 urban farmers communities trained in composting techniques. The
   literature has shown difficulties in government experiments to promote
   practices in the long run and several experiences in Brazil are already
   described. This study reveals cultural barriers that influence adoption
   of domestic composting, by following a secondary data review on past
   experiences with interviewing and observing participatively urban farms
   communities. From the fieldwork, cultural perspectives from four
   different relevant actor roles in the UAP were elaborated and conflicts
   between them revealed cultural barriers hindering composting practices
   adoption. Recommendations based on these barriers argue for bottom-up
   approaches for transition experiments and recognising the sense material
   and technical support makes to practitioners.

AB Literature suggests that despite its positive aim of promoting
   innovation, the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation (EC) No.
   1924/2006 (NHCR) may bring along several compliance challenges, which
   might affect innovation in the EU food sector. This study investigates
   the challenges faced by companies to comply with the NHCR (specifically
   Article 13.1) and their impact on innovation. To this end, we conducted
   an online survey with 105 companies involved in the EU food sector.
   Results indicate that companies perceive wording of claims, missing
   transparency and limited financial resources as major challenges to
   comply with the NHCR (Article 13.1). Companies reported not to have
   increased their R&D expenditure or innovation activities after the NHCR
   (Article 13.1) was implemented. Thus, this study highlights specific
   compliance challenges related to the NHCR (Article 13.1) and indicates
   that currently, the regulation does not seem to have fostered innovation
   in the EU food sector.

AB Vaccinomics is the convergence of vaccinology and population-based omics
   sciences. The success of knowledge-based innovations such as vaccinomics
   is not only contingent on access to new biotechnologies. It also
   requires new ways of governance of science, knowledge production, and
   management. This article presents a conceptual analysis of the
   anticipatory and adaptive approaches that are crucial for the
   responsible design and sustainable transition of vaccinomics to public
   health practice. Anticipatory governance is a new approach to manage the
   uncertainties embedded on an innovation trajectory with participatory
   foresight, in order to devise governance instruments for collective ''
   steering '' of science and technology. As a contrast to hitherto
   narrowly framed '' downstream impact assessments '' for emerging
   technologies, anticipatory governance adopts a broader and
   interventionist approach that recognizes the social construction of
   technology design and innovation. It includes in its process explicit
   mechanisms to understand the factors upstream to the innovation
   trajectory such as deliberation and cocultivation of the aims, motives,
   funding, design, and direction of science and technology, both by
   experts and publics. This upstream shift from a consumer '' product
   uptake '' focus to '' participatory technology design '' on the
   innovation trajectory is an appropriately radical and necessary
   departure in the field of technology assessment, especially given that
   considerable public funds are dedicated to innovations. Recent examples
   of demands by research funding agencies to anticipate the broad impacts
   of proposed research-at a very upstream stage at the time of research
   funding application-suggest that anticipatory governance with foresight
   may be one way how postgenomics scientific practice might transform in
   the future toward responsible innovation. Moreover, the present context
   of knowledge production in vaccinomics is such that policy making for
   vaccines of the 21st century is occurring in the face of uncertainties
   where the '' facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and
   decisions urgent and where no single one of these dimensions can be
   managed in isolation from the rest.'' This article concludes, however,
   that uncertainty is not an accident of the scientific method, but its
   very substance. Anticipatory governance with participatory foresight
   offers a mechanism to respond to such inherent sociotechnical
   uncertainties in the emerging field of vaccinomics by making the
   coproduction of scientific knowledge by technology and the social
   systems explicit. Ultimately, this serves to integrate scientific and
   social knowledge thereby steering innovations to coproduce results and
   outputs that are socially robust and context sensitive.

AB Background
   Lower rates of successful quitting among low-income populations in the
   United States may be from slower dissemination of smoke-free homes, a
   predictor of cessation.
   Objectives
   To explore the role of smoke-free homes in cessation behavior across
   income levels.
   Participants
   Current smokers who were >= 18 years and who participated in the
   longitudinal 2002-2003 (n = 2801) or 2010-2011 (n = 2723) Tobacco Use
   Supplements to the Current Population Survey.
   Measurements
   We categorized income as multiples of the federal poverty level (FPL)
   (<300% FPL versus >= 300% FPL). We examined the association of
   smoke-free homes with 1+day quit attempts and 30+days abstinence at
   1-year follow-up. We then conducted a mediation analysis to examine the
   extent that smoke-free homes contributed to income disparities in
   30+days abstinence.
   Results
   Between the two surveys, heavy smoking (>= 1 pack/day) declined by 17%,
   and smoking prevalence declined by 15% among those with higher-incomes
   (>300%FPL). Although similar in 2002, the prevalence of smoke-free homes
   was 33% lower among individuals living <300% FPL than those living >=
   300% FPL. Although the quit attempt rate was similar, the 30 +days
   abstinence rate was higher in the 2010-11 cohort than in 2002-3 cohort
   (20.6% versus 15.5%, p<0.008). Whereas smoking >= 1 pack/ day was
   associated with lower odds of 30 +days abstinence (Adjusted odds ratio
   [AOR] 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9), having a higher income (AOR 1.9, 95% CI
   1.4-2.6) and a smoke-free home (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1) were associated
   with greater odds of 30+day abstinence. Differential changes in
   smoke-free homes across income groups between the two surveys
   contributed to 36% (95% CI 35.7-36.3) of the observed income disparity
   in 30+days abstinence.
   Conclusions
   Increasing the diffusion of smoke-free homes among low-income
   populations may attenuate at least a third of the income disparities in
   smoking cessation, highlighting the need for interventions to increase
   adoption of smoke-free homes among low-income households.

AB Introduction
   Sub-Saharan Africa lags in adoption of mobile health (m-health)
   applications and in leveraging m-health for sustainable development
   goals. There is a need for a comprehensive investigation of determinants
   of hospitals' adoption of m-health in Sub-Saharan Africa to inform
   policies, practices and investments.
   Methods
   This investigation used a logit regression model to analyze the
   determinants of m-health adoption in Kenyan hospitals applying the
   Technological, Organizational and Environmental (TOE) framework and the
   Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory. A representative sample of 211
   executives of Level 4-6 hospitals in 24 counties provided primary data
   on Patient-Centered (PC) and Facility-Centered (FC) m-health
   applications.
   Results
   Both PC and FC m-health adoption were predicted by competition for
   patients (PC p = 0.041, FC p = 0.021), IT human resource capacity (PC p
   = 0.048, FC p = 0.037), and hospital pursuit of market growth through
   technological leadership (PC p = 0.010, FC p = 0.020). Further
   determinants of PC m-health adoption included hospital access to slack
   financial resources (p = 0.006), acquisition strategy (p = 0.011),
   compatibility with the hospital systems (p = 0.015), trialability (p =
   0.019), medical insurance company support (p = 0.025), patient pressure
   (p = 0.036), and perceived effect of global medical tourism (p = 0.039).
   FC m-health adoption was predicted by hospital size (p = 0.008), ICT
   infrastructure capacity (p = 0.041), and government support (p = 0.013).
   Conclusion
   A differentiated approach is required to scale up m-health adoption. PC
   m-health requires emphasis on establishing national and regional
   compatibility and interoperability, developing trialability processes
   and validation mechanisms, incentivizing patient competition and
   mobility, establishing innovative and cost-effective acquisition
   strategies, and ensuring integration of digital services within national
   insurance schemes and policies. These policies require support from
   patients and communities to drive demand and spur investment in adequate
   IT human resources to maintain reliability. Pilot PC m-health projects
   should prioritize hospitals with slack financial resources, while FC
   m-health should target large facility size. FC m-health applications are
   more complex and costly than PC, requiring government incentives to
   trigger hospital investments and national investment in ICT
   infrastructure. Investors and hospital managers should integrate
   m-health into market growth strategies for sustainable m-health scale-up
   in Kenya and beyond.

AB This paper applies a structural equation model (SEM) to analyze the
   formation of awareness and perception of water scarcity, based on a
   cross-sectional dataset of 446 farmers in the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi
   Province, China. We find that age, percentage of time spent on farming
   and social network are the main determinants of awareness. Water price
   and drought experience are the most important explanatory variables of
   perception. In addition, awareness and perception strongly interact. The
   results obtained in this paper are relevant for policymaking, since
   environmental behavior, which includes efficient use of natural
   resources, tends to improve if supported by internalization of social
   norms, which in its turn, is promoted by awareness and perception. From
   the analysis it follows that spreading information via social networks,
   rather than via the media, is an important vehicle to enhance awareness
   and perception and thus to improve irrigation water use efficiency.
   Special attention should be paid to part-time farmers who are limited in
   directly perceiving water scarcity. Finally, more use should be made of
   the price mechanism to strengthen perception and awareness. (C) 2013

AB Because economic evaluations of health care services are being published
   with increasing frequency it is important to (a) evaluate them
   rigorously and (b) compare the net benefit of the application of one
   technology with that of others. Four "levels of evidence" that rate
   economic evaluations on the basis of their methodologic rigour are
   proposed. They are based on the quality of the methods used to estimate
   clinical effectiveness, quality of life and costs. With the use of the
   magnitude of the incremental net benefit of a technology, therapies can
   also be classified into five "grades of recommendation." A grade A
   technology is both more effective and cheaper than the existing one,
   whereas a grade E technology is less or equally effective and more
   costly. Those of grades B through D are more effective and more costly.
   A grade B technology costs less than $20 000 per quality-adjusted
   life-year (QALY), a grade C one $20 000 to $100 000/QALY and a grade D
   one more than $100 000/QALY. Many issues other than cost effectiveness,
   such as ethical and political considerations, affect the implementation
   of a new technology. However, it is hoped that these guidelines will
   provide a framework with which to interpret economic evaluations and to
   identify additional information that will be useful in making sound
   decisions on the adoption and utilization of health care services.

AB Objectives. We evaluated state-level characteristics associated with
   cigarette excise taxes before and after the Master Settlement Agreement
   (MSA).
   Methods. We gathered annual cigarette excise tax rates for all US states
   and the District of Columbia, between 1981 and 2011, and matched each
   state-year tax rate with economic, political, attitudinal, and
   demographic characteristics, creating a data set of 1581 observations.
   We used panel data regression techniques to assess relationships between
   key characteristics and state cigarette excise tax levels.
   Results. Cigarette excise tax rates grew at more than 6 times the rate
   of inflation between 1981 and 2011; growth varied by time period and
   region. We found strong negative associations between Republican Party
   control of state legislatures and governors' offices and state cigarette
   tax rates. Tobacco production, citizens' attitudes toward taxes and
   tobacco control, and cigarette tax rates in neighboring states were
   significantly associated with cigarette tax rates. We found no
   association between unemployment and tax rates.
   Conclusions. Future excise tax growth rate may depend more on the
   political leanings of state legislators, and the attitudes of the people
   they represent, than on economic circumstances.

AB Aim - The 1998 consensus conference dealing with colon cancer, and the
   2003 Cancer Plan underlined the need for multidisciplinary meetings and
   for including patients in therapeutic trials. The aim of this study,
   which pooled data from the French Cancer Registries operating within the
   Francim network, was to report on diagnostic and therapeutic practices
   in the general French population before implementation of the Cancer
   Plan. Methods - The study population was composed of 2935 patients with
   colorectal cancer diagnosed in 2000 in twelve French administrative
   districts accounting for 15% of the geographical area of France. Data
   were collected using a standardized procedure. Three categories of place
   of diagnosis were defined: public university hospitals, public
   non-university hospitals, and private clinics. Results - Overall,
   multidisciplinary meeting was conducted for 32.2% of patients with
   colorectal cancer. This proportion varied from 6.4% to 76.9%, depending
   on the geographical area (P < 0.001). The place of diagnosis affected
   this practice: 52% in public university hospitals, 31% in public
   non-university hospitals and 29% in private clinics (P < 0.001). In
   multivariate analysis, age (OR > (75 years): 0.71, P < 0.001), site
   (ORrecturn: 1.80, P < 0.001) and health care facilities (ORpublic
   non-university vs public university; 0.36, P < 0.001, ORprivate vs
   public university: 0-40, P < 0-001) affected the use of
   multidisciplinary meeting. Overall, 4.3% of patients were included in a
   therapeutic trial. This concerned 6.2% of patients aged under 75 and
   1.0% of those aged over 75 (P < 0.001). The proportion of inclusions,
   taking into account the trials proposed in 2000 and 2001, varied from
   0.7% to 16.4% according to geographical area (P < 0.001). This
   proportion was 10.3% if there had been multidisciplinary meeting and 5.
   1 % if not (P < 0.00 1). Neither cancer site, gender, nor healthcare
   facility responsible for diagnosis influenced trial inclusion.
   Conclusion - This population-based study underlines geographical
   variations in the management of colorectal cancer in France. In 2000,
   multidisciplinary meeting was conducted for an insufficient proportion
   of patients, and an insufficient number of patients were included in
   therapeutic trials. Repeating the same survey in 2005 will provide
   information on the effects of the Cancer Plan and the diffusion of these
   recommendations.

AB Health claims potentially represent an opportunity for firms to engage

   innovation in the food sector. The Nutrition and Health Claims
   Regulation (EC) No. 1924/2006 (NHCR) aims at protecting and promoting
   innovation as one of its objectives. However, existing studies indicate
   that this regulation may create several challenges for innovation in the
   food sector. To this end, we review the challenges related to the NHCR
   (Article 13.1) and its impact on innovation. Extant literature suggests
   that companies face challenges related to changing list of ingredients,
   missing transparency, wording of claims, limited financial resources,
   limited R& D resources, switching product categories and abandoning the
   functional foods sector. Moreover, current studies imply that so far the
   NHCR (in specific Article 13.1) does not seem to encourage innovation in
   the EU food sector.

AB With non-communicable diseases (NCDs) projected to become leading causes
   of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, research is needed
   to improve the primary care response, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
   This region has a particularly high double burden of communicable
   diseases and NCDs and the least resources for an effective response.
   There is a lack of good quality epidemiological data from diverse
   settings on chronic NCD burden in sub-Saharan Africa, and the approach
   to primary care of people with chronic NCDs is currently often
   unstructured. The main primary care research needs are therefore
   firstly, epidemiological research to document the burden of chronic
   NCDs, and secondly, health system research to deliver the structured,
   programmatic, public health approach that has been proposed for the
   primary care of people with chronic NCDs. Documentation of the burden
   and trends of chronic NCDs and associated risk factors in different
   settings and different population groups is needed to enable health
   system planning for an improved primary care response. Key research
   issues in implementing the programmatic framework for an improved
   primary care response are how to (i) integrate screening and prevention
   within health delivery; (ii) validate the use of standard diagnostic
   protocols for NCD case-finding among patients presenting to the local
   health facilities; (iii) improve the procurement and provision of
   standardised treatment and (iv) develop and implement a data collection
   system for standardised monitoring and evaluation of patient outcomes.
   Important research considerations include the following: selection of
   research sites and the particular NCDs targeted; research methodology;
   local research capacity; research collaborations; ethical issues;
   translating research findings into policy and practice and funding.
   Meeting the research needs for an improved health system response is
   crucial to deliver effective, affordable and equitable care for the
   millions of people with chronic NCDs in developing countries in Africa.

AB China is the largest cement producer and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter in
   the world. The country has attracted too much attention in calculating
   and comparing its CO2 emissions. However, as the second largest CO2
   emitter after the fire power industry, China's long-term cement demand
   and cement-related CO2 emission projections were not fully studied. The
   Chinese government, however, committed that by 2020 and 2030, China's
   per capita GDP of CO2 emissions would be lower than that in 2005 by
   40-45% and 60-65%, respectively. In this paper, China's cement demand in
   2030 was projected based on the population size, urbanization rate,
   fixed assets investment, and per capita GDP. Furthermore, decoupling
   study in China's cement industry was also involved based on the GDP and
   CO2 emissions during 2001-2015. We also used the diffusion rate of 12
   types of CO2 reduction measures and two changed scenarios of
   clinker-to-cement ratio, to project the cement CO2 emission factors
   toward 2030 after determining the accounting scope. Meanwhile, the CO2
   emissions of China's cement industry through 2030 were projected
   naturally. The results showed that China's cement output in 2030 will be
   approximately 2000, 1650, and 937 Mt. based on the fixed assets
   investment, urbanization rate, and per capita GDP respectively. The
   projected two scenarios cement CO2 emission factors were resp. 407.83
   and 390.02kg CO2/t of cement which were 42.6 and 45.1% lower than that
   in 2005. The cement CO2 emissions were projected to be in the range of
   366 to 818 Mt. in 2030. Additionally, China's total cement output value
   has been decoupling from cement CO2 emissions from 2012, which is mainly
   attributed to eliminating backward capacity, reducing excess capacity or
   the declining cement output. And decoupling economic from China's cement
   CO2 emissions may change to be strong or weak decoupling in the near
   future. As cement production is one of the factors effecting cement CO2
   emissions, the most important measure for controlling cement CO2
   emissions is a reasonable capacity utilization rate. It is therefore
   important to control the growth of cement CO2 emissions by regulating
   the capacity utilization rate within a reasonable range. Eliminating
   backward capacity, removing excess capacity, controlling new capacity,
   staggered production, and the going global of cement equipment can have
   great impacts in controlling the total amount of cement output and CO2
   emissions.

AB During land-aquatic transfer, carbon (C) and inorganic nutrients (IN)
   are transformed in soils, groundwater, and at the groundwater-surface
   water interface as well as in stream channels and stream sediments.
   However, processes and factors controlling these transfers and
   transformations are not well constrained, particularly with respect to
   land use effect. We compared C and IN concentrations in shallow
   groundwater and first-order streams of a sandy lowland catchment
   dominated by two types of land use: pine forest and maize cropland.
   Contrary to forest groundwater, crop groundwater exhibited oxic
   conditions all-year round as a result of higher evapotranspiration and
   better lateral drainage that decreased the water table below the
   organic-rich soil horizon, prevented the leaching of soil-generated
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater, and thus limited
   consumption of dissolved oxygen (O-2). In crop groundwater, oxic
   conditions inhibited denitrification and methanogenesis resulting in
   high nitrate (NO3-; on average 1140 +/- 485 mu mol L-1) and low methane
   (CH4; 40 +/- 25 nmol L-1) concentrations. Conversely, anoxic conditions
   in forest groundwater led to lower NO3- (25 +/- 40 mu mol L-1) and
   higher CH4 (1770 +/- 1830 nmol L-1) concentrations. The partial pressure
   of carbon dioxide (pCO(2); 30,650 +/- 11,590 ppmv) in crop groundwater
   was significantly lower than in forest groundwater (50,630 +/- 26,070
   ppmv), and was apparently caused by the deeper water table delaying
   downward diffusion of soil CO2 to the water table. In contrast, pCO(2)
   was not significantly different in crop (4480 +/- 2680 ppmv) and forest
   (4900 +/- 4500 ppmv) streams, suggesting faster degassing in forest
   streams resulting from greater water turbulence. Although NO3-
   concentrations indicated that denitrification occurred in
   riparian-forest groundwater, crop streams nevertheless exhibited
   important signs of spring and summer eutrophication such as the
   development of macrophytes. Stream eutrophication favored development of
   anaerobic conditions in crop stream sediments, as evidenced by increased
   ammonia (NH4+) and CH4 in stream waters and concomitant decreased in
   NO3- concentrations as a result of sediment denitrification. In crop
   streams, dredging and erosion of streambed sediments during winter
   sustained high concentration of particulate organic C, NH4+ and CH4. In
   forest streams, dissolved iron (Fe2+), NH4+ and CH4 were negatively
   correlated with O-2 reflecting the gradual oxygenation of stream water
   and associated oxidations of Fe2+, NH4+ and CH4. The results overall
   showed that forest groundwater behaved as source of CO2 and CH4 to
   streams, the intensity depending on the hydrological connectivity among
   soils, groundwater, and streams. CH4 production was prevented in
   cropland in soils and groundwater, however crop groundwater acted as a
   source of CO2 to streams (but less so than forest groundwater).
   Conversely, in streams, pCO(2) was not significantly affected by land
   use while CH4 production was enhanced by cropland.
   At the catchment scale, this study found substantial biogeochemical
   heterogeneity in C and IN concentrations between forest and crop waters,
   demonstrating the importance of including the full
   vegetation-groundwater-stream continuum when estimating land-water
   fluxes of C (and nitrogen) and attempting to understand their spatial
   and temporal dynamics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Livestock food systems play key subsistence and income generation roles
   in low to middle income countries and are important networks for
   zoonotic disease transmission. The aim of this study was to use a value
   chain framework to characterize the broiler chicken meat system of
   Nairobi, its governance and sanitary risks.
   A total of 4 focus groups and 8 key informant interviews were used to
   collect cross-sectional data from: small-scale broiler farmers in
   selected Nairobi peri-urban and informal settlement areas; medium to
   large integrated broiler production companies; traders and meat
   inspectors in live chicken and chicken meat markets in Nairobi.
   Qualitative data were collected on types of people operating in the
   system, their interactions, sanitary measures in place, sourcing and
   selling of broiler chickens and products. Framework analysis was used to
   identify governance themes and risky sanitary practices present in the
   system.
   One large company was identified to supply 60% of Nairobi's day-old
   chicks to farmers, mainly through agrovet shops. Broiler meat products
   from integrated companies were sold in high-end retailers whereas their
   low value products were channelled through independent traders to
   consumers in informal settlements. Periurban small-scale farmers
   reported to slaughter the broilers on the farm and to sell carcasses to
   retailers (hotels and butcheries mainly) through brokers (80%), while
   farmers in the informal settlement reported to sell their broilers live
   to retailers (butcheries, hotels and hawkers mainly) directly. Broiler
   heads and legs were sold in informal settlements via roadside vendors.
   Sanitary risks identified were related to lack of biosecurity, cold
   chain and access to water, poor hygiene practices, lack of inspection at
   farm slaughter and limited health inspection in markets. Large companies
   dominated the governance of the broiler system through the control of
   day-old chick production. Overall government control was described as
   relatively weak leading to minimal official regulatory enforcement.
   Large companies and brokers were identified as dominant groups in market
   information dissemination and price setting. Lack of farmer association
   was found to be system-wide and to limit market access. Other system
   barriers included lack of space and expertise, leading to poor
   infrastructure and limited ability to implement effective hygienic
   measures.
   This study highlights significant structural differences between
   different broiler chains and inequalities in product quality and market
   access across the system. It provides a foundation for food safety
   assessments, disease control programmes and informs policy-making for
   the inclusive growth of this fast-evolving sector.

AB Objectives. We explored the relationship between boarded-up housing and
   rates of gonorrhea and premature mortality.
   Methods. In this ecological study of 107 US cities, we developed several
   models predicting rates of gonorrhea and premature death before age 65
   from all causes and from specific causes. We controlled for race,
   poverty, education, population change, and health insurance coverage.
   Results. Boarded-up housing remained a predictor of gonorrhea rates,
   all-cause premature mortality, and premature mortality due to malignant
   neoplasms, diabetes, homicide, and suicide after control for
   sociodemographic factors.
   Conclusions. Boarded-up housing may be related to mortality risk because
   of its potential adverse impact on social relationships and
   opportunities to engage in healthful behaviors. Neighborhood physical
   conditions deserve further consideration as a potential global factor
   influencing health and well-being.

AB Purpose: To investigate the impacts of the first phase of Taiwan's
   Bureau of National Health Insurance (TBNHI) smart card project on
   existing hospital information systems.
   Setting: TBNHI has launched a nationwide project for replacement of its
   paper-based health insurance cards by smart cards (or NHI-IC cards)
   since November 1999. The NHI-IC cards have been used since 1 July 2003,
   and they have fully replaced the paper-based cards since 1 January 2004.
   Hospitals must support the cards in order to provide medical services
   for insured patients.
   Methods: We made a comprehensive study of the current phase of the
   NHI-IC card system, and conducted a questionnaire survey (from 1 October
   to 30 November, 2003) to investigate the impacts of NHI-IC cards on the
   existing hospital information systems. A questionnaire was distributed
   by mail to 479 hospitals, including 23 medical centers, 71 regional
   hospitals, and 355 district hospitals. The returned questionnaires were
   also collected by prepaid mail.
   Results: The questionnaire return rates of the medical centers, regional
   hospitals and district hospitals were 39.1, 29.6 and 20.9%,
   respectively. In phase 1 of the project, the average number of card
   readers purchased per medical center, regional hospital, and district
   hospital were 202, 45 and 10, respectively. The average person-days for
   the enhancement of existing information systems of a medical center,
   regional hospital and district hospital were 175, 74 and 58,
   respectively. Three months after using the NHI-IC cards most hospitals
   (60.6%) experienced prolonged service time for their patients due to
   more interruptions caused mainly by: (1) impairment of the NHI-IC cards
   (31.2%), (2) failure in authentication of the SAMs (17.0%), (3)
   malfunction in card readers (15.3%) and (4) problems with interfaces
   between the card readers and hospital information systems (15.8%). The
   overall hospital satisfaction on the 5-point Likert scale was 2.86.
   Although most hospitals were OK with the project, there was about 22%
   dissatisfied and strongly dissatisfied, that is twice as many hospitals
   with satisfied (about 10%).
   Conclusions: Our recommendations for those who are planning to implement
   similar projects are: (1) provide public-awareness programs or campaigns
   across the country for elucidating the smart card policy and educate the
   public on the proper usage and storage of the cards, (2) improve the
   quality of the NHI-IC cards, (3) conduct comprehensive tests in software
   and hardware components associated with NHI-IC cards before operating
   the systems and (4) perform further investigations in authentication
   approaches and develop toots that can quickly identify where and what

AB Context Organized care management processes (CMPs) can Improve
   healthcare quality for patients with chronic diseases. The Institute of
   Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences has called for public and
   private purchasers of health care to create incentives for physician
   organizations (POs) to use CMPs and for the government to assist POs in
   implementing information technology (IT) to facilitate CMP use. Research
   is lacking about the extent to which POs use CMPs or about the degree to
   which incentives, IT, or other factors are associated with their use.
   Objectives To determine the extent to which POs with 20 or more
   physicians use CMPs and to identify key factors associated with CMP use
   for 4 chronic diseases (asthma, congestive heart failure, depression,
   and diabetes).
   Design, Setting, and Participants One thousand five hundred eighty-seven
   US POs (medical groups and independent practice associations) with 20 or
   more physicians were identified using 5 large databases. one thousand
   one hundred four of these POs (70%) agreed to participate in a telephone
   survey conducted between September 2000 and September 2001. Sixty-four
   responding POs were excluded because they did not treat any of the 4
   diseases, leaving 1040 POs.
   Main Outcome Measures Extent of use of CMPs as calculated on the basis
   of a summary measure, a PO care management index (POCMI; range, 0-6) and
   factors associated with CMP use.
   Results Physician organizations' mean use of CMPs was 5.1 of a possible
   16; 50% used 4 or fewer. External incentives and clinical IT were most
   strongly associated with CMP use, Controlling for other factors, use of
   the 2 most strongly associated incentives-public recognition and better
   contracts for health care quality-was associated with use of 1.3 and 0.7
   additional CMPs, respectively (P<.001 and P=.007). Each additional IT
   capability was associated with 0.37 additional CMPs (P<.001). However,
   33% of POs reported no external incentives and 50% reported no clinical
   IT capability.
   Conclusions The use of CMPs varies greatly among POs, but it is low on
   average. Government and private purchasers of health care may increase
   CMP use by providing external incentives for improvement of health care
   quality to POs and by assisting them in improving their clinical IT
   capability.

AB Objective To examine infant feeding intentions of HIV-infected and
   uninfected women and the appropriateness of their choices according to
   their home resources; and to determine their adherence to their
   intentions in the first postnatal week.
   Methods Feeding intentions of pregnant women were compared against four
   resources that facilitate replacement feeding: clean water, adequate
   fuel, access to a refrigerator and regular maternal income. First-week
   feeding practices were documented.
   Findings The antenatal feeding intentions of 1253 HIV-infected women
   were: exclusive breastfeeding 73%; replacement feeding 9%; undecided
   18%. Three percent had access to all four resources, of whom 23% chose
   replacement feeding. Of those choosing replacement feeding, 8% had
   access to all four resources. A clean water supply and regular maternal
   income were independently associated with intention to replacement feed
   (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1,94, 95% confidence interval (0) 1.2-3.2;
   AOR 2.1, 95% Cl: 1.2-3.5, respectively). Significantly more HIV-infected
   women intending to exclusively breastfeed, rather than replacement feed,
   adhered to their intention in week one (exclusive breastfeeding 78%;
   replacement feeding 42%; P < 0.001). Of 1238 HIV-uninfected women, 82%
   intended to exclusively breastfeed; 2% to replacement feed; and 16% were
   undecided. Seventy-five percent who intended to exclusively breastfeed
   adhered to this intention postnatally, and only 11 infants (< 1%)
   received no breast milk. The number of antenatal home visits
   significantly influenced adherence to feeding intention.
   Conclusion Most HIV-infected women did not have the resources for safe
   replacement feeding, instead choosing appropriately to exclusively
   breastfeed. Adherence to feeding intention among HIV-infected women was
   higher in those who chose to exclusively breastfeed than to replacement
   feed. With appropriate counselling and support, spillover of suboptimal
   feeding practices to HIV-negative women is minimal.
