	abstract = {The transport sector is particularly difficult to decarbonize. Use of electric vehicles (EV)—a potentially transformative and sustainable transport technology—can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, domestic fossil fuel demand, energy import dependency, and air pollution. Policies play an important role in the diffusion of new technologies, such as EVs, principally in their formative stage as they compete with an incumbent technology. However, great discrepancies exist across countries regarding EV support and uptake. EV diffusion is conceptualized as an outcome of policy diffusion based on national characteristics and international mechanisms. This study aims to explain the variation in EV policy diffusion across countries, by conducting an event history analysis on EV diffusion (EVs > 1% market share) between 2010 and 2017, using a sample of 60 countries. It identifies characteristics and mechanisms relevant to the novel technology's “formative phase”, focusing on the formation of state goals, international diffusion, and local technology adoption and deployment. The empirical contribution lies in identifying and validating socioeconomic and political factors and the international mechanisms influencing a country's position on the diffusion curve. This can help improve scenarios via better reflecting EV diffusion. © 2021 The Author},

	abstract = {This paper examines copy-and-paste regulating in hydraulic fracturing (HF) fluid disclosure regulation across US states. Using text analysis, cluster analysis and document coding, we compare HF regulations of twenty-nine states and two “model bills” drafted by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF, an environmental NGO). In contrast to recent studies that have documented ALEC's widespread influence across policy domains, we find limited evidence of ALEC influence in HF fluid disclosure regulations. Instead, elements of the EDF bill are more prevalent across state regulations. Yet, text similarity scores between states are higher than similarity scores between states and the EDF bill. In particular, Colorado and to a lesser extent Pennsylvania functioned as leader states for other states to follow. This indicates that state-to-state communication was a more influential channel of policy diffusion than interest group model bills in this instance. Future research should better examine processes of information sharing amongst state oil and gas regulators as regulatory text is but one channel of policy diffusion. The cluster analysis also reveals that contiguous states, often within the same shale basins, frequently have different regulations. This finding calls for a reconsideration of the current state-led environmental regulatory framework for HF, which has resulted in a patchwork of regulations across the US. Finally, through the use of novel text analysis tools, this paper adds methodological diversity to the study of policy diffusion within energy policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change policy is an essential driver of urban sustainability, yet minimal research has examined how they emerge and spread across cities in shared metropolitan areas. While policy diffusion or policy mobility theories could explain the aforesaid, much of the international scholarship have not utilized an amalgamation of these two complementary theoretical perspectives. As a result, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the regional dynamics and spillover effects local governments can generate for urban sustainability. This article proposes a contingent diffusion model to examine the intra-regional adoption of local climate action plans within Southern California from 2000 to 2018. We find that neighboring jurisdictions that adopt climate policy increase the likelihood of a home city's adoption. Yet, neighboring effect is contingent on the home city's existing pro-environmental policy propensity. However, in contrast to conventional wisdom, this study finds no evidence that local environmental advocacy groups play a crucial role in the diffusion of municipal climate initiatives. Altogether, the results suggest that a regional diffusion model of policy innovations is more likely successful when adaptive capacity is in place to facilitate green infrastructure. These findings provide implications for policymakers and planners who want to achieve successful spillovers of urban climate policies across local governments. © 2021},

Yet, variation in their implementation invites questions as to how and why countries adopt social distancing policies, and whether the causal mechanisms driving these policy adoptions are based on internal resources and problem conditions or other external factors such as conditions in other countries. We leverage daily changes in international social distancing policies to understand the impacts of problem characteristics, institutional and economic context, and peer effects on social distancing policy adoption. Using fixed-effects models on an international panel of daily data from 2020, we find that peer effects, particularly mimicry of geographic neighbors, political peers, and language agnates drive policy diffusion and shape countries' policy choices. © 2022 Policy Studies Organization.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to show that research on policy diffusion mechanism of Government Procurement of Public Services (GPPS) is beneficial to improve the efficiency of policy formulation and implementation. Design/methodology/approach: In view of the four dimensions which are internal demand, external pressure, policy innovation environment and service characteristic, a system of factors affecting policy diffusion is established. On this basis, a Multilayer Fuzzy Cognitive Map (MFCM) model for policy diffusion of GPPS is constructed. Nonlinear Hebbian Learning algorithm and genetic algorithm are applied to optimize the two components of the MFCM model, which are relationship between nodes at the same layer and influence weights between nodes at different layers, respectively. Taking Nanjing municipal government purchasing elderly-care services in China as the empirical object, simulation of policy diffusion based on the MFCM model is carried out, aiming to obtain the key factors influencing policy diffusion and the dynamic diffusion mechanism of GPPS policy. Findings: Research results show that, compared with monolayer Fuzzy Cognitive Map, the MFCM model converges faster. In addition, simulation results of policy diffusion indicate that economic development level of jurisdiction, superior pressure, administrative level and operability of services are key influencing factors which are under four dimensions correspondingly. And the dynamic influencing mechanism of key factors has also been learned. Originality/value: This paper constructs the MFCM model, which is a new approach based on several monolayer FCMs, to study the policy diffusion mechanism. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

While subnational housing policies can be used to increase racial and economic segregation, they can also protect renters, and thus are not without controversy. Local affordable housing policies include inclusionary zoning, rent control, short-term rental regulation and source of income discrimination. Starting in the 1980s, states began to preempt these local laws, preventing their cities from adopting affordable housing policies. We ask why states choose to preempt one or more of these four affordable housing policies. Using a cross-sectional, time-series dataset of preemptions, we find evidence that more conservative legislatures are more likely to adopt preemptions, while more professional legislatures and states with higher rental rates and previous preemptions are less likely to preempt. Contrary to expectations, interest group density, electoral competition and policy diffusion are not significant predictors of preemption. For advocates and policymakers concerned with increasing affordable housing in their jurisdictions, these results raise unease about the ability to further an affordable housing agenda at the local level, particularly in more conservative political environments, suggesting instead that affordable housing may need to return to the purview of the federal government. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2022.},

This study explains the strictness or extent of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) adopted by states from 1996 to 2013, developing hypotheses based on states’ economic conditions, political structures, user demands, criminal justice demands, and the impact of neighboring states. We develop an index score that captures state statute strictness by analyzing and coding the statutes of MMLs in each state. Our findings show (1) that factors that influence adoption of MMLs are not the same as the factors that influence the strictness of policies and (2) that the regulation of users and what they are allowed to have for medical marijuana treatment are associated with different variables than the regulation of dispensaries. Overall, the leniency of MMLs is associated with liberal government ideology, poor state fiscal health, unemployment, the size of the state’s criminal justice bureaucracy, numbers of AIDS/cancer patients, and number of neighboring states that have adopted MMLs. Laws regarding users tend to become more lenient over time in states. © 2020 Western Social Science Association.},

While research on energy transitions has generated an extensive literature, the extent to which it has used the policy innovation perspective – entailing policy entrepreneurship or invention, policy diffusion, and policy success – remains unclear. This study analyzes over 8000 publications on energy transitions through a bibliometric review and computational text analysis to create an overview of the scholarship, map conceptual engagement with public policy, and identify the use of the policy innovation lens in the literature. We find that: (i) though the importance of public policy is frequently highlighted in the research, the public policy itself is analyzed only occasionally; (ii) studies focusing on public policy have primarily engaged with the concepts of policy mixes, policy change, and policy process; and (iii) the notions of policy entrepreneurship or invention, policy diffusion, and policy success are hardly employed to understand the sources, speed, spread, or successes of energy transitions. We conclude that the value of the policy innovation lens for energy transitions research remains untapped and propose avenues for scholars to harness this potential. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine Brazil’s international activism and ascent to the status of rising state during the presidencies of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003–2010) and his chosen successor, Dilma Rousseff (2011–2014). We focus on the dissemination of social policies under an innovative model of development that reflected the political and economic context of a developing country. We argue that this activism was framed in terms of Brazil’s socio-economic and cultural peculiarities, whereby these were treated not as obstacles but as positive contributions to developing states’ attempts to reform global governance structures. We argue that this reflects an alternative form of foreign policy politicisation in which the social dilemmas, particularities and contradictions of the Brazilian experience are incorporated in the foreign policy agenda to leverage its international stature as a rising state. We explain how Brazil’s international cooperation through transferring its public policies and development models (policies for fighting hunger and poverty, agrarian development and income generation) to its Southern partners has been discursively articulated as representing Brazil’s normative potential to contribute to political and institutional solutions, and rebuild norms and standards that affect the distribution of international power and wealth. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.},

While leaders often claim responses are based on the best available advice from scientists and public health experts, recent policy diffusion research suggests that countries are emulating the COVID-19 policies of their neighbors instead of responding to domestic conditions. Political and geographic considerations play a role in determining which countries imitate one another, but even among countries that are politically or geographically distant, nationalist regimes seem to favor certain approaches towards the pandemic. We investigate why this is the case by examining whether countries that embrace a nationalist ideology are more likely to emulate the COVID-19 policies of similarly nationalist regimes. We demonstrate that, even after controlling for domestic circumstances and linguistic, trade, geographic, and political connections, nationalist countries are emulating each other’s responses. These results are robust and shed light not only on new mechanisms of policy diffusion but also on the growing international cooperation of nationalist regimes and leaders. © 2020, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.},

In the last four decades, however, while school reformers have continued to borrow policies and practices from the business world, the dominant business model itself has changed dramatically as part of the financialization of the economy. Once a bureaucratically governed social institution, focused on long-term stability and committed to multiple stakeholders, the corporation has become a destabilized network of temporary contracting relationships, singularly focused on maximizing shareholder value. This conceptual article explores what it means for schools, as public and democratic institutions, to emulate business in the era of financialization. Through analysis of several recent trends in business-inspired school reform policy, I demonstrate the diffusion of financialization logic and practices into public schools. I argue that while business may have historically been a problematic model for educational policy, business is now a uniquely unqualified model. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {This study shows that when social movements achieve a general acceptance for the legitimacy of their cause in the institutional environment, they may start pursuing further demands by challenging their target entities through the ‘politics of alignment,’ meaning engaging these entities in professionally developed programs and demanding specific outcomes by introducing timed interventions in them. This study exemplifies this politics using the case of American LGBT workplace movement which used its Corporate Equality Index (CEI) program to extend reputational and economic benefits to its target entities—the Fortune 500 corporations—but also added an intervention to this program in 2011 to demand the adoption of gender transition-related health benefits by these corporations as a specific movement outcome which, if not met, would make these corporations lose the benefits they had been deriving through their performance in the CEI program. A longitudinal study of 456 Fortune 500 corporations from 2008 to 2017 conducted through hazard rate analysis indicates that corporations affected by this intervention, as well as by other movement factors, were the most likely to adopt these health benefits for their employees. Further quantitative analysis—using QCA—shows that early adoptions were explained largely by the LGBT workplace movement forces and the later adoptions by insider activism and isomorphic diffusion. These findings highlight that an incisive understanding of organizational change can be best gathered by examining social movements and institutional forces together. ©The Author(s) 2021.

To better understand the conditions under which diffusion occurs, this article argues that three heuristics - availability, representativeness and anchoring - shape parties' efforts to gather information (from elsewhere), leading to differing diffusion effects. The study operationalizes the outcome as textual similarity of party manifestos in nineteen Western democracies from 1960 to 2016, applying a text-as-data approach and machine translation. Analyzing dyads, it assesses how commonalities and sender/receiver attributes impact diffusion. It finds that there is little room for cross-border diffusion as successful parties stick to their old program. Beyond the still-prevailing domestic context, 'learning from cultural reference groups' in a region is most important. In addition, diffusion appears within EP factions and transnational party organizations independently of the success/loss of the sender. The analysis thus sheds light on (un-)favorable conditions for party policy diffusion and paves the way for future studies applying machine translation and quantitative text analyses.

We compare the role that resilience plays in crisis early warning in diplomatic services at the EU and member state level in France and Germany. Drawing on the literature on Europeanization and diffusion, we seek to explain different levels of convergence regarding a resilience approach in early warning at the levels of strategy, analysis and action. We find that the diffusion item’s specificity, the number of sources and particular institutional contexts impact the resulting level of convergence. Member states see value in complementing risk analysis with a resilience perspective, but the EU has failed to provide a sufficiently clear source model.

This study demonstrates that predictors of policy adoption change throughout the diffusion life course. Neighbor adoptions matter early in the life course but are supplanted by the consistent effect of ideological learning across all stages. The results confirm that less professionalized states tend to adopt later. Finally, state wealth and population size are increasingly important as policies spread. These results have implications for our understanding of when and why states adopt policy innovations.

Four mechanisms of policy diffusion—learning, competition, emulation and coercion—have become widely accepted as explanations for how policymaking processes and policy outcomes in one polity influence those in other polities. After pointing to major shortcomings of this inductively gained set of mechanisms, we present a theoretically more coherent typology that draws on key concepts from International Relations and Policy Studies. The four mechanisms we lay down consider rationalist and social constructivist approaches equally and they incorporate symmetric and asymmetric constellations. By further distinguishing between processes confined to one policy field and those arising from links across policy fields, we present a typology of eight theoretically consistent pathways of policy diffusion.

	abstract = {Global convergence of public policies has been regarded as a defining feature of the late twentieth century. This study explores the generalizability of this thesis for three road safety measures: (i) road safety agencies; (ii) child restraint laws; and (iii) mandatory use of daytime running lights. This study analyzes cross-national longitudinal data using survival analysis for the years 1964–2015 in 181 countries. The first main finding is that only child restraint laws have globally converged; in contrast, the other two policies exhibit a fractured global convergence process, likely as the result of competing international and national forces. This finding may reflect the lack of necessary conditions, at the regional and national levels, required to accelerate the spread of policies globally, adding further nuance to the global convergence thesis. A second finding is that mechanisms of policy adoption, such as imitation/learning and competition, rather than coercion, explain more consistently global and regional convergence outcomes in the road safety realm. This finding reinforces the idea of specific elective affinities, when explaining why the diffusion of policies may or not result in convergence. Lastly, by recognizing fractured convergence processes, these results call for revisiting the global convergence thesis and reintegrating more consistently regional analyses into policy diffusion and convergence studies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Our research examines how executive leadership characteristics, city-level contextual factors, and interdependence mechanisms relate to cities' decisions to visit. Using two-stage probit selection models with instrumental variables on a dyadic balanced panel dataset recording all policy tourism events between major U.S. cities from 2007 to 2016, we answer this question accounting for potential endogeneity problems. Our findings suggest that cities with experienced yet newly appointed, minority leaders tend to visit cities with experienced white or female leaders. Additionally, policy tourism happens among cities embedded in highly complex, munificent, and turbulent environments. Finally, cities tend to learn from peers with higher economic prosperity or interact with their competitors. © 2022 The Authors.

We study this question here, considering the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and three policies it supported: scientific temperance instruction, increasing the age of consent, and prohibiting tobacco sales to minors. Overall, WCTU-supported legislation was more likely to succeed in states with unified Republican state legislatures, aided by neighboring state adoptions (scientific temperance) and greater WCTU membership (increasing age of consent and prohibiting tobacco sales to minors). These findings are supported by historical evidence, which reveals how WCTU leadership targeted particular states when lobbying for scientific temperance instruction laws and utilized its broad membership base to pressure state legislatures on the other two issues. In total, these results show how one late nineteenth-century membership group was able to facilitate the successful spread of its policies throughout the nation.  © 2021 Cambridge University Press.},

In this paper, we compile data on the passage of First Nations tax laws over a 30-year period from a centralized national database on First Nations by-laws, the First Nations Gazette. We combine those data with additional sources to analyze the factors that are associated with First Nations exercising their taxation authority. We find evidence of geographic policy diffusion consistent with First Nations learning from their neighbors and direct evidence that formal educational and institutional resources are important correlates of tax law adoption. Understanding that process informs the broader literature on the evolution of taxation structures and local political incentives, the analysis may contain important lessons for Indigenous tax jurisdiction in other contexts. It is also a critical first step towards assessing the long-term consequences of First Nations’ new fiscal powers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Two problems were identified in this work, deviations in policy diffusion and the completeness of energy consumption data. In this study, four standards on heating in China are summarized in relation to different historical stages. By combining the historical energy consumption data with a questionnaire survey, it indicates actual heating energy consumption is far from the expectation of standards put in the past. The energy use intensity of surveyed boiler systems is 12.46 kgce/m2. For these situations, energy saving percentage, used widely in building energy policy in China, needs to be abolished and a scientific statistic indicators on heating according to the new standard should be established. In addition, only constant supervision and timely adjustment of policy implementation based on monitoring energy heating use could make heating policy well-enforced.

	abstract = {Quantitative studies of social policy diffusion face substantial challenges regarding their understanding of causal mechanisms. Knowledge of diffusion processes is particularly limited in authoritarian countries, in comparatively autonomous developing countries, and fields of social policy not characterized by hegemonic ideas and strong epistemic communities. This study focuses on technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in the People's Republic of China. The conceptual approach is based on the interaction-oriented understanding of causal mechanisms in actor-centred institutionalism, and the framework of lesson drawing. Methodologically, this study follows a process tracing approach, relying on semi-structured interviews with Chinese experts, recently de-classified project reports of the World Bank, and content analysis of Chinese legal and regulatory documents. Analysing why China introduced a system of vocational qualification certificates similar to English National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), rather than German-style dual vocational apprenticeships, it uncovers a mechanism of bureaucratic conflict between competing coalitions of domestic ministries and transnational actors from the UK and Germany in a context of organizational hierarchy with multiple principals. The World Bank here attempted to play the role of a neutral international principal, but could only do so in limited ways and insofar as its preferences were compatible with those of the leadership core of the Party-state. The study illustrates how bureaucratic conflict mediates policy learning, explaining the diffusion and non-diffusion of different policy options. Furthermore, it highlights doubts regarding the mechanism of coercion, which remained largely ineffective. © 2021 The Author. Social Policy & Administration published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Within polycentric city-regions aspiring to ‘progressiveness’, LGBTQ2S-supportive municipal social inclusion policy is further subject to arrhythmic diffusion. In this article we introduce the neologism of scalar arrhythmia (a biomedical metaphor that parallels the pace of diffusion with the irregularities of a heartbeat) in conjunction with scale-contingent coalitional moments (spatiotemporal junctures that bring people together to enact social change) to advance an urban social justice agenda. We argue that the analytical vantage point of scalar arrhythmia reveals differences in the longitudinal temporal (a)synchronicities of peripheral municipal inclusion policy diffusion and locates transformative scale-contingent coalitional moments. Through an analysis of the interplay of diffusion processes and mechanisms across the adjacent peripheral municipalities of Burnaby, New Westminster and Surrey in Canada's Vancouver city-region, we demonstrate provincial–municipal hierarchical ‘coercion’, core–periphery metropolitan relocation ‘imitation’ and municipal inter-peripheral contagious ‘competition’. While peripheral patterns of scalar arrhythmia rupture Vancouver's illusive progressive regionalism, the concept offers civic leaders an inventorying opportunity that redirects attention away from cursory LGBTQ2S policy performances towards substantive policy integrations and local innovations. © 2022 Urban Research Publications Limited.},

Research focusing on Euro-Mediterranean regulatory contexts commonly expect neighbouring countries to converge with EU regulatory models. Yet, borrowing on policy diffusion literature and specifically the mechanisms of learning and imitation, this article shows that policy-takers intentionally decided on the (non)adoption of USO policies.

The diffusion of innovations represents a transmission of information, personal relationships, creativity and similarities across boundaries. While policy and management innovation and diffusion studies began as an American state policy field, over the last 20 years the studies have expanded to include new frameworks for Chinese, Korean and other countries’ innovation and diffusion studies. Using an expanded range of institutional structures, leadership, and factors that impact innovation and diffusion, these studies embrace more comparative studies of policy diffusion across countries. In this paper, we lay out key topics in organizational and policy innovation studies, and independent variables found to lead to innovation and diffusion. In addition, we argue we should expand the types of variables included in multivariate models to empirically test questions related to which innovations diffuse rapidly or incompletely, why governments adopt innovations, and what barriers and resources are present across types of innovations. We introduce three types of boundaries—space boundaries, time and path dependency boundaries, and actors boundaries that we believe should be more regularly and broadly included in innovation and diffusion studies, and we conclude by defining how these boundaries can be operationalized. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Institute for Global Public Policy, Fudan University.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many states have adopted policies to ensure students are reading proficiently by third grade. This kind of policy transfer across states is not a unique phenomenon; researchers have documented analogous proliferations of similar policies both in and outside the field of education. However, there has been little attention paid to how policy transfer happens in K-12 education policy, particularly at the state level. To better understand how education policies spread across states, we turn to the case of Michigan’s Read by Grade Three Law, which was adopted in 2016. Guided by the Multiple Streams Framework and the theory of policy transfer, we trace the policy process surrounding the Law’s conception, development, and passage, relying on data from semi-structured interviews from 24 stakeholders involved in the development of the Law and supported by policy documents from all 50 states and D.C. We find that events in the problem and political streams opened a policy window that allowed for the passage of the Law. These findings contribute to policymakers’ and other stakeholders’ understandings of the development and passage of third-grade literacy policies—information that will be important as these policies continue to receive national attention in both the policy and research communities. Moreover, this study is one of few to focus on the critical role of policy entrepreneurs in joining together the multiple streams, while also providing a nuanced view of how policy transfer and policy entrepreneurship promote the convergence of ideas and solutions to particular problems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

This article compares four countries–Germany, Norway, Poland and Sweden to identify key structural conditions (enablers and barriers) for female representation in academia by studying the regulative framework of government policy. Two research questions are guiding the analysis: first, what (if any) policy instruments are chosen to increase the number of female leaders in HE? Second, to what extent does this choice of instruments mirror either sectorial logic (HE) or national policy styles? The empirical results of the article show that while processes of policy diffusion are observable at the sectoral level, gender equality policies and instrument choice differ considerably in the four countries under consideration. The article thus concludes that national policy styles need to be understood as enabling and disabling policy factors for gender equality in HE shaping the process of translating diffused models decisively. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The ways in which epistemic foundations of academic disciplines shape policy paradigms have been an understudied area. We illustrate such dynamics by focusing on paradigm shifts between economics and legal scholarship. Our case study focuses on the evolution of the Finnish corporate tax policy between 1991 and 2014 to illuminate complex policy diffusion through professions. First, in 1993, Finnish corporate tax policy was aligned with the neoclassical ideas of the time in a lawyer-driven process. Second, in the early 2000s, initiatives from the EU and the OECD provided these lawyers a new epistemic source for broadening their argumentation. Third, in the 2010s, the disciplinary base shifted from legal studies to economics, which coincided with administrative reforms emphasizing quantitative impact assessments. These transformations completed the shift from legal scholarship to economics in tax policy design, paving way to the entrance of economic theoretical arguments to tax policy discussions. Our findings highlight five overlapping and mutually reinforcing factors that shape knowledge production in expert groups that influence economic policy: (1) the extent to which politicians rely on expertise; (2) the balance of power between academic disciplines in evidence-based policy-making; (3) the disciplinary base to which the dominant expert groups rely on; (4) the shifts in the epistemological, ontological and methodological mainstream within particular disciplines; and, (5v) the extent to which international organizations are seen as epistemic versus policy-driven authorities. © 2021 CONVIVIUM, association loi de 1901 2021.},

Particularly: what is it that moves? Why do some policies move but others do not? Academic conversations have involved concepts like “policy diffusion”, “policy transfer”, “lesson-drawing”, “fast policy”, “policy mobility” and “policy translation” - but a clear picture of how these concepts have been used to interpret housing policy developments is absent. Through systematic bibliographical searches, we identified 55 ‘housing’ publications to review. Our concern is the theoretical assumptions underlying these studies and their implications for the questions stated above. Through a grounded analysis, we identified ‘dominant knowledge’ as the key element shaping housing policy movement; highlighted five strategic conditions for mobility (summarized as ontological, ideological, institutional, legitimizing devices, and contingency); presented the sporadic engagement with questions of immobility; and synthesized authors’ policy recommendations, particularly their calls for deeper engagement with the people affected by policies. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, provincial governments have taken divergent measures in the fight against COVID-19. This research note disentangles the differences and similarities in virus containment policies based on a five-dimensional framework, namely starting early preparation, activation of first-level response, disclosure of epidemic information, resumption of work and production, and utili-zation of digital tools. Our analysis demonstrates that the government responses are uneven and that there are indeed front-runners in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Building upon exiting theories on local government behaviors, we suggest that “conformity tendency” in policy diffusion might be helpful to explain the varied responses. During public emergencies, while any provincial government can take the initiative in a particular policy dimension, others need to quickly handle peer pressure or take the political risk of being left behind. Gradually, local governments tend to accept and adopt similar responses and strategies in the national epidemic. © 2021, Chinese University Press. All rights reserved.},

Policy entrepreneurs on each side of the capital controls debate can point to capital account policies in other countries as evidence for the desirability of their position. This issue framing strategy, in turn, influences domestic preferences on capital controls. We present qualitative evidence showing that the international policy context features heavily in domestic political debates about capital controls in China. Next, using original survey data, we show that information about other countries’ policy choices influences mass public attitudes about capital controls in China. The evidence indicates that growing global use of capital controls can strengthen public support for this policy. More broadly, these findings suggest that a complete understanding of policy diffusion requires greater attention to the role played by domestic policy entrepreneurs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Sub-national governments are a crucial non-state actor for mitigating climate change. This importance has recently strengthened as increasing numbers of municipalities declare net-zero carbon emission goals to support the Paris Agreement, often well ahead of national governments. In Japan, net-zero declarations have also diffused widely, with nearly 800 declarations appearing in domino-like fashion over 2019–2022. To elucidate the factors that propelled this rapid diffusion, we used an event-history analysis based on data from a survey to develop an integrated statistical model. We then deepen understanding of diffusion mechanisms through seven brief case studies informed by interviews and document analysis. We find that the drivers of policy diffusion varied over time. During the early stage, internal factors drove the spread of declarations; namely participation in transnational city networks, endowed human and financial resources, and political leadership. But in later stages, diffusion was mostly propelled by external factors; namely declarations by neighboring cities and the affiliated prefectural government. Through these findings, we contribute to scholarship through two novel perspectives. First, we reveal the factors driving policy diffusion across both early adopters and the ordinary majority. Second, we show how the influence of well-known factors can vary during different stages of policy diffusion. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {The article studies UNESCO's program that, from the late 1960s onward, aimed at spreading globally the concept of cultural policy. An essential part of the program, UNESCO invited member states from different regions of the world to prepare reports on national cultural policy. That was successful in spreading cultural policy as a concept and as a governmental structure. Except for only Australia, Canada and the United States, in which cultural policy is handled at a sub-state level, all countries that produced a national report have established a ministry of culture, typically synchronously with the report. The analysis suggests that UNESCO's success was due to two factors: the process of domestication and peer pressure. This means that, for one thing, the UNESCO materials stressed differences rather than similarities, and therefore the program was not seen as a threat to national sovereignty. Rather than mentioning the program's contribution to structural isomorphism, the documents stressed that developing and reporting on a national cultural policy are means to support and promote national art and cultural heritage. Secondly, diffusion of the concept of cultural policy benefitted from international comparisons enabled by the national reports and the tendency of countries to emulate others, especially those belonging to the same reference group. These two factors were results of strategic planning on UNESCO's part. Experienced in seeking to guide national policies, the UNESCO staff members could anticipate the challenges that the program could face and the processes that different moves could trigger. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {A central insight from institutional theory about markets is that they cannot operate without governing rules to guide interactions among actors. Because most of these rules are made and enforced within national borders, international economic transactions are said to suffer from an “institutional abyss,” the lack of institutional arrangements for economic exchanges. Scholars have found that the abyss can be filled by two factors: network connectedness, such as inter-governmental organizations, and intercountry economic agreements, such as the World Trade Organization or free trade. This article proposes a third factor: the global diffusion of governmental regulations. When countries adopt highly standardized regulations on a particular transaction, it provides legal familiarity for foreigners and reduces procedural uncertainty surrounding how the transaction should be executed. Using fixed-effects models on longitudinal data, I show that the adoption of antitrust and merger laws increases the volume of cross-border mergers—the transaction the laws are meant to regulate. This result stands in direct opposition to financial scholars’ predictions that antitrust and merger laws will reduce cross-border mergers because the laws are meant to restrain, not liberate, the transaction. This article theorizes how the diffusion of regulations, not the elimination of regulations, can facilitate global market integration. © 2020 Eastern Sociological Society},

This article critically examines the evidence base underpinning that ideational consensus among international organizations (IOs) and global management consulting firms (GMCFs). We collected 234 skills reports produced over the past decade by major IOs (European Commission, ILO, OECD, UNESCO, and World Bank) and GMCFs (BCG, Deloitte, Ernest and Young, KPMG, McKinsey, and PWC). We then extracted bibliographic references from each report and used the analytic technique of citation analysis to examine how the consensus around these core skills was generated in order to uncover the authoritative sources of knowledge and the pattern of ideational policy diffusion observed. Our analysis reveals substantial gaps in the evidence base used. Evidence drew largely on a few academic economists, along with strong use of grey literature, and high rates of self-citation. Given these characteristics, the consensus around twenty-first century skills appears less epistemic in nature and more like an ideational echo chamber, which raises concerns about the extent to which policymakers should rely on this evidence. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Notwithstanding the increase in the study of open government policies over the past decade across multiple levels of government, the factors influencing the decision to join multilateral initiatives like the Open Government Partnership are still under-researched. Using data from 175 countries and covering a period that goes from the year prior to the establishment of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) until the year when the latest current members have joined the partnership (2010–2018), this article examines the diffusion mechanisms affecting a country's decision to participate in the OGP. Based on binary response logit regression models, this study analyses the effects of key diffusion variables while controlling for the countries' internal determinants of participation. The findings indicate that diffusion of the OGP takes place through regional proximity, common cultural and system of government traits, and membership in international organization. While democratic countries are more likely to join, autocracies also join conditional on other countries in the same group joining. This suggests further research is needed to uncover the way countries with different regime traits design and implement transparency and open government policies under the banner of this multilateral initiative. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Based on the analysis of 130 original interviews with government officials and NGO and IO representatives in eight South American countries we show that - although South American policymakers generally regard the EU as a model of ‘efficiency’, in terms of the EU’s intra-regional mobility regime–the remarkable legislative liberalisation in the region took place in the context of both political and moral opposition to restrictive shifts in EU extra-regional migration governance.

This paper synthesizes theories about policy innovation and adoption, and literature about hazards mitigation, and proposes a theoretical framework for understanding the factors driving hazard mitigation policy adoption at the local level. Our goal is to identify the key elements and parameters of the hazard mitigation policy adoption construct as well as the relationship between them. Using the property buyout program as an example, we present case studies in the states of North Carolina and New Jersey to illustrate a proposed theoretical framework and outline the directions for future research. The case studies show promising evidence consistent with the proposed framework, covering five categories - hazard problem, social context, institutional capacity, cross-sector collaboration, and policy diffusion. In particular, as for institutional capacity, three aspects influence the uptake of buyouts, including individual capacity [e.g., geographic information system (GIS) and technical skills], organizational capacity (e.g., reducing the negative financial impact on the tax base of buyouts and encouraging an innovative culture of flood mitigation strategies), and system capacity (e.g., cooperation among local organizations). To further validate the framework, systematic research of localities with diverse characteristics of policy adopters and nonadopters is needed.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Many post-Soviet countries have joined the BP, while many developing countries are also aligning their higher education systems with it. A diverse body of literature attempts to address the questions as to why do countries engage in policy borrowing and what makes it successful. Through our in-depth primary case study of Kazakhstan and a comparative assessment of similar cases in the post-Soviet space researched by other scholars, we make twofold contribution to this literature. First, we argue that governments often borrow policies with less clearer objectives, making it difficult to evaluate ‘success’ or ‘failure’ of the policy transfer. Second, differentiating between the success of policy transfer itself and the achievement of its perceived or real goals, we contend that the success of policy transfer is not a guarantee for the achievement of policies’ original objectives which may be disappointing for both exporting and importing parties. In that, wide-ranging socio-political institutional differences explain the varied rationales and outcomes. © 2022 Society for Research into Higher Education.},

Using the theoretical lenses of policy diffusion and policy drift, this study assesses the development of IPV coalitions from 1976 to 2018, paying particular attention to institutional structures, intergovernmental resources, and strategic service priorities. We find evidence of policy drift and multidirectional policy diffusion in state IPV institutional structures, service delivery, federal program participation, and strategic priorities of these activities. Federal grant programs increase the likelihood of program emulation among states and may encourage innovation within existing institutional and policy structures for the development of comprehensive services and a preventive approach to IPV that best serve vulnerable groups. © 2021 by The American Society for Public Administration.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The term “charity hazard” refers to the issue of the crowding out of insurance by co-existing relief programs in the context of different institutional governmental disaster schemes. In this context, the aim of this paper is to verify if the charity hazard phenomenon exists in the Italian agricultural insurance scheme. Design/methodology/approach: Annual data regarding crop insurance, subsidies and farm structure were extracted from ISMEA, ISTAT and FADN databases. A SYS-GMM dynamic panel model was estimated, considering the 2010–2017 time period and the Italian Regions as units of the analysis. Findings: The empirical results highlight a negative relation between crop subsidies and the farmers' policies and total premium paid. The disincentive and crowd-out effects of public aid and subsidies on the choice of whether or not to take out an agricultural insurance policy ends up being one of the key factors for the low level of penetration of the agricultural insurance in Italy. Practical implications: Since the diffusion of agricultural insurance can contribute to the general objective of sustainability and resilience, the implementation of alternative solutions to subsidies could be needed (e.g. the introduction of mandatory insurance against adversities or financial support for a geographically specific insurance tool). Originality/value: Investigating empirically the determinants of the agricultural insurance policy diffusion among the Italian Regions, this study ensures an original contribution to the scientific progress in the field, demonstrating the existence of charity hazard caused by the public subsidies provision. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Thus, this study contributes to enriching the theoretical development of policy diffusion from a different angle and can thereby help us learn more about why governments repeal an established policy. Economists have provided economic justifications for why a state’s prevailing wage law should be upheld or abolished depending on their stance. However, the empirical results show that economic justification is not a persuasive reason. In other words, other, non-economic factors are more influential in the repeal of a prevailing wage law: political ideology, union power, and regional diffusion. These results are in line with arguments made in previous policy termination studies. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {This paper thoroughly examines the adoption of the financial regulatory sandbox regime in Taiwan. As the first civil law country that has promulgated a new law to implement this regime, Taiwan contributes towards and embodies an archetype of policy diffusion mechanisms of financial regulatory innovation. The discussion on sandbox diffusion remains incomplete in the literature, and this paper is an attempt to fill in the gaps. Our analysis suggests that financial regulators, the legislative branch, foreign regulators, government-supported fintech hubs, and private institutions are all affiliated in this process of policy diffusion. Forerunner states provide essential references and sometimes offer direct assistance to help promulgate the sandbox regime. This paper also explores the three main diffusion mechanisms: competition, learning, and emulation, which have all played different roles in this process of diffusion. Despite different and sometimes conflicting interests, stakeholders are concerned with fintech-related regulatory issues. Their shared interests in the regulatory sandbox regime result from a strong consensus, thus leading to the successful enactment of sandbox legislation. Taiwan’s case study holds policy implications on how a civil law country adopts financial regulatory innovation and through which mechanisms the popular regulatory sandbox was diffused into the country. © 2022 School of Law, City University of Hong Kong.},

During a similar period, between 1975 and 2017, 162 countries adopted renewable energy targets – official national commitments to increase the share of renewable energies. What induced the diffusion of these renewable energy targets? What are the patterns of their diffusion? We analyze data from 187 countries and assess four possible mechanisms of policy diffusion of renewable energy targets: learning, economic competition, emulation, and coercion. Using a qualitative comparative analysis, we find eight pathways to renewable energy target adoption. In the most common pathways, economic competition, emulation, and coercion played a significant role. Before there is a critical mass of countries to emulate, our analysis shows that early adopters followed the mechanisms of economic competition and coercion. Ultimately, we find that there is no one recipe for the diffusion of renewable energy targets, and we identify the specific countries associated with the different diffusion pathways. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

It has been recognized that a veritable way to achieve efficiency in PPP governance is through gaining an understanding of the theoretical, practical and contextual factors that underline governance practices in PPP project delivery. The purpose of this study is to explore the significant governance factors in PPP project performance and delivery. Design/methodology/approach: Using a questionnaire survey on major players in PPPs in policy, research, consultancy and professionals, the study sought to delineate the significant governance factors that impact PPP project delivery performance. Findings: A step-wise multiple regression analysis revealed effective communication and openness in sharing project information systems, competent, responsible and effective project leadership, trust-building processes, systems and practices, best practice organizational and team norms, team culture, cohesion practices, effective relationship management practices, robust policy diffusion and transfer processes, friendly business environment and government support and contractual and renegotiation flexibility as the key contractual and non-contractual governance factors that can predict about 79% level of PPP project delivery performance. Social implications: The findings offer support to improve PPP delivery in governance. Originality/value: These findings are, thus, useful toward evolving regulatory quality governance mechanisms, flexible supervision and quality decisions that can enhance value for money in PPP projects in PPP project delivery. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To do so, we review 102 articles from 20 top generalist and subfields journals, from 1998-2018. We find that there is an important geographical divide in research traditions: US scholars tend to focus the pressures of competitive ‘race-to-the-bottom’ dynamics or on mechanisms of policy diffusion; comparative and non-US scholars instead emphasise institutional diversity across decentralized countries and drivers of variation in subnational policy choices, including structural and cultural factors, partisanship and vertical and horizontal linkages. In the conclusion, we develop five conclusions that highlight how this sub-field can develop a coherent research programme. © 2022 The Author(s).

Comparative analysis suggests that OGP membership is correlated with higher e-participation scores, that this is not solely attributable to national political factors, but that alignment of national traditions and structures with civic participation norms has a positive moderating effect on OGP's relationship to e-participation. OGP's effect on collaborative e-decision-making is consistently more pronounced than OGP's effect on e-participation generally. This supports the assertion that OGP membership socializes participation norms in government institutions, and that this socialization effect is more pronounced in more democratic countries and in regard to more advanced participation norms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

In this context, several states have rolled out algorithmic risk assessment tools for statewide use in pretrial decisions, whereas some others have not, and still others are moving back from using such tools again. The present article examines the explanations for this variance. To this end, it tests competing expectations about the role of functional pressures, including fiscal strain and the party-political balance of power. The findings show that functional pressures, policy diffusion, and politics affect the likelihood that algorithmic tools will be used in criminal justice. Democratic control of both the state executive and legislative branches increases the likelihood that a state will use these tools, indicating that Republicans are reluctant to leave the “tough on crime” paradigm behind and to advance the “smart on crime” approach. © 2022 The Authors.

While there is consensus that trafficking necessitates a multipronged policy response commonly known as the “3Ps” (prosecution, protection, and prevention), anti-trafficking policies diffused across U.S. states in a piecemeal fashion. In this paper, we explore the fragmented diffusion of the different types of anti-trafficking laws. Drawing from social constructivist approaches, we posit that the differential diffusion rates depend on the social construction of the target population and policy intention of the law. Using event history analysis, we examine the diffusion of 14 types of human trafficking laws throughout the U.S. during 2003–2013. We find strong support for our hypotheses and show substantial differences in the rates at which prosecution, protection, and prevention-related laws diffuse. © 2021 Policy Studies Organization.},

Data were collected via individual and group interviews with 26 key policy stakeholders during fieldwork at the eight universities and centred on language-related policy diffusion surrounding admissions, language support, and language use. Findings revealed a reliance on foundation year studies at transnational universities versus the Gaokao (national college entrance examination) at other universities to ensure students had the requisite proficiency upon admissions. Findings also revealed transnational universities were more likely to offer language support to their students and have language policies governing language use. Overall, the findings reveal a range of affordances and caveats associated with each institution’s contextualized policy making, causing ease and conflict for EMI stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Taking two major policy fields - decentralization and governance - the chapter examines the initiatives taken by UN-Habitat and the World Bank in advancing these ideas to cities in the developing world. Although the World Bank has a much more substantial resource base than does UN-Habitat, both of these agencies are limited in important ways. Cities (in both the North and the South) are increasingly finding new ideas and support from other cities, through the elaboration of city-based networks, and the face to face contacts that their mayors and professionals make when they attend network meetings. Instead of policies flowing exclusively from the North to the South, as in the past, they now flow in both directions, as cities connect horizontally with each other according to their specific needs, and their policy-making ability matures. © Osmany Porto de Oliveira 2021.},

Public health experts advocate for social distancing to slow the spread of infectious diseases, but government mandates to social distance can impose substantial social and economic costs. This study uses event history analysis to investigate the issuance of COVID-19-related gubernatorial SAHOs during a 41-day period in the 50 U.S. states. The findings indicate that scientific, political, and economic factors were associated with the issuance of SAHOs, but that external considerations played the largest role, particularly those related to the timing of other governors’ decisions. This study offers evidence about how some U.S. political leaders balance public health concerns against other considerations and, more broadly, how state governments address crisis-level issues. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Twenty-one interviews with key participants, primary materials from government and personal archives, and newspaper articles were used to attribute and corroborate these events. A new finding is that community choice aggregation was created as part of electric sector restructuring efforts in Massachusetts in 1997, but that this new policy was barely perceived by many stakeholders in the larger restructuring process, and was included by legislators in response to advocates who organized local governments through direct democracy strategies. Kingdon's multiple streams approach provides a useful framework to understand how organizing by advocates led to successful passage of legislation in Massachusetts. The spread of community choice aggregation to other states occurred through organizing that combined advocacy with policy learning and emulation. CCA has since been adopted by more than 1800 local governments that represent more than 36 million people in six states. This article concludes by discussing the early outcomes, current status, and some prospective implications of community choice aggregation. © 2021 The Author},

It continues to spread across the globe as government officials and citizens adopt this innovative program in the hopes of strengthening accountability, civil society, and well-being. Governments often transform PB's rules and procedures to meet local needs, thus creating wide variation in how PB programs function. Some programs retain features of radical democracy, others focus on community mobilization, and yet other programs seek to promote participatory development. This book provides a theoretical and empirical explanation to account for widespread variation in PB's adoption, adaptation, and impacts. The book first develops six "PB types," then, to illustrate patterns of change across the globe, four empirical chapters present a rich set of case studies that illuminate the wide differences among these programs. The empirical chapters are organized regionally, with chapters on Latin America, Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and North America. The empirical chapters demonstrate that there are temporal, spatial, economic, and organizational factors that produce different programs across regions but similar programs within each region. A key finding is that the change in PB rules and design is now leading to significant differences in the outcomes these programs produce. We find that some programs successfully promote accountability, expand civil society, and improve well-being, but, that we continue to lack evidence that might demonstrate if PB leads to significant social or political change elsewhere. © Brian Wampler, Stephanie McNulty, and Michael Touchton 2021.},

This ‘policy plagiarism’ is perceived by critics as symptomatic of process failures and likely to undermine policy success. To proponents, copy and paste legislation stems from an efficient learning process likely to guarantee policy success. The authors test competing hypotheses by measuring success and plagiarism across three areas of US state policy: organ donation legislation, e-cigarette/vaping bans for minors and anti-bullying legislation. They find that higher levels of plagiarism result in significantly less success at reducing youth vaping rates and increasing organ donor registrations. They also find a negative, though not significant, relationship between copying and success for antibullying policy. The evidence favours opponents: legislators risk harming policy success by copying from others. This study of policy plagiarism advances knowledge by moving beyond the simple demonstration of the phenomenon to investigate the potential link between the copying of legislative text and the extent to which the policies studied achieved their goals. © Policy Press 2022},

	abstract = {The regional trade governance architecture is in flux. The latest wave of regionalism in the form of mega-regional trade partnerships between countries with major shares of the world economy occurred in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–09. The most systematically important mega-free trade agreements (FTA) included the Trans-Pacific Partnership led by the United States (US), the Chinesebacked Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union (EU) and the US. Drawing on policy diffusion and competitive regionalism literatures, Xianbai Ji develops an innovative model of competitive spill-over to uncover the historical and contemporary sources of mega-regionalism resulting from a temporal clustering of mega-FTA initiatives from great powers. In the book, mega-FTA is conceptualised as an instrument of geo-economic competition between the US, China and the EU. Each aspired to leverage its mega-FTA to gain an edge over its rivals in economic, geopolitical and legal terms. Through a mix-method research strategy involving computable general equilibrium modelling, game theory, desk research and perception survey, Ji generates an impressive chorus of quantitative, qualitative and perceptual data demonstrating that the rise of mega-regionalism was driven by the multidimensional competition between the US, China and the EU over international economic benefits, geopolitical influence and the authority to write rules governing emerging trade issues. This book will attract academics, think tankers, practitioners and postgraduate students interested in regionalism, international trade, international political economy, applied trade policy analysis, great power competition, geo-economics and international relations. © 2022 Xianbai Ji.},

The growth of this sector, which includes vocational colleges, also contributes to increasingly diverse national higher education systems. Prior research has focused on inter-state variation in national systems, while very few studies have explored intra-state variation in the expansion of non-university sector. Building on the policy innovation and diffusion model, this study uses event history analysis to investigate key drivers behind Chinese prefecture cities’ adoption of vocational colleges during the latest tertiary education expansion. The study employs a rich panel dataset from 273 Chinese cities between 2000 and 2014. Findings suggest that the socioeconomic and the politico-institutional contexts matter the most for cities’ policy adoption, and the influence of policy diffusion is negative but not significant. Moreover, there is substantial heterogeneity across time and region. The characteristics of early adopters significantly differ from those of late adopters, and the diffusion paths vary within and across regions. This study illustrates that the emergence of sub-national government affiliated non-university institutions is driven by a complex combination of socioeconomic, politico-institutional, and policy forces. Results highlight the regional contextual factors that may override coercive pressure from national strategies to promote the non-university sector expansion and the structural diversity in the context of less developed economies. © 2023, International Association of Universities.},

While turnaround policy started in New Jersey in 1989, it did not spread rapidly or widely until the eras of No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top (RTTT). We specifically address how RTTT leveraged a coercive federalism that helped propel policies like school turnarounds. Using data on turnaround adoptions from 1989 to 2019 and applying diffusion of innovations theory, we find evidence that ideological learning and RTTT competition relate to the policy's spread among the states, though there is stronger evidence for a horizontal diffusion than a vertical one. The findings build on a growing literature regarding the dynamics of federal oversight in policy diffusion and contribute to understanding how competitive incentives like RTTT can have ripple effects on nonwinning states.

	abstract = {To contain the initial spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus and the COVID-19 disease, many countries opted to close schools. However, the importance of schooling to mitigate inequalities motivated many economies to reopen schools after having formulated various COVID-19 mitigation and containment strategies. Using an exploratory sequential mixed method design, we explore the measures undertaken by countries when reopening schools and how these measures varied cross-nationally. We find that countries formulated a wide number (total: 242) and range of school reopening measures to mitigate the spread of the virus in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. From a policy diffusion theoretical perspective, findings from our statistical analyses suggest that cross-national diversity in policies is related to both internal and external country factors such as peer emulation mechanisms, income, and past pandemic experiences. We urge international agencies for more explicit guidelines for effective school reopening measures. © The Author(s) 2021.},

This study leverages the coincidence of the 2005 French referendum on the European Constitution and the fieldwork of two surveys to analyze the causal effect of cross-national social influence.

	abstract = {Motivation: Turkey has been acknowledged as a “successful” example of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) reforms and has recently gained donor “darling status.” While the literature on UHC and health reforms in various countries has increased significantly in recent years, there is still little research on the political dynamics of the rise of UHC in national and global development agendas. Purpose: This study examines the politics of UHC in Turkey’s Health Transformation Program (HTP). It investigates how various policy actors, such as international organizations, policy experts and national political leaders, use UHC framing for different purposes. Approach & Methods: The article develops an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that combines elements of ideational scholarship and critical policy analysis. The analysis is based on a review of the secondary literature and primary sources. Qualitative content analysis is used to identify major themes and analyse patterns of interactions across the various policy levels. Findings: The article’s main findings demonstrate the ways in which international actors and national policy-makers engage in policy work and use their relationships, global policy ideas and experiences to build legitimacy and support for their respective agendas. Reforms in Turkey were proposed and implemented before the rise of UHC in the global agenda, suggesting an ex post facto rebranding of its reforms as UHC. For Turkey’s policy-makers, rebranding worked to tie their policy solutions, summarized in the HTP, to UHC as a widely accepted cultural symbol. The Ministry of Health’s deliberate strategy to encourage data collection and monitoring was also a key part of its efforts to construct a success narrative in collaboration with global policy actors. For the global-level advocates of UHC, Turkey provided evidence that UHC works. Before it became a target under the health-related Social Development Goals (SDGs), advocates needed to demonstrate that they had the right framing and metrics for a UHC agenda. After 2015, successful examples have served as strategic tools for building support and political momentum as the agenda was diffused, and as these diverse agendas and interests overlapped. Policy Implications: This article contributes to the current debates on policy diffusion, translation and implementation of the UHC agenda. It unpacks the use of success stories to navigate the political dynamics among national governments and global policy communities. Success stories, alongside an emphasis on country ownership, may serve to encourage the co-production of policy across local, national and global levels. © The Authors 2020.

	abstract = {How and why neoliberal policies spread across political jurisdictions is a fundamental question for economic geographers and critical policy scholars. Many accounts inspired by the policy mobility approach point to neoliberalism as having a conditioning effect on the ease and speed with which policies transverse the globe. Yet the role that social movements and transnational advocacy networks play in shaping and at times facilitating neoliberal policy diffusion has been under-examined. In this article, I bring a new perspective to the policy mobilities literature, by incorporating insights from radical feminist and critical disability theorising. Drawing on the work of Nancy Fraser, I argue that in their haste to scrutinise and theorise neoliberalism as a project of the Right, policy mobility scholars have neglected the mobilising role of the transnational left. Elements of the Left have leant critical support to market-based models of state restructuring, out of concern for minority rights and the welfare state’s denial of individual agency and choice. To illustrate my argument, I use a case study of the disability movement and the policy model of individualised funding, which is driving the current trend towards greater marketisation in the provision of disability services. © The Author(s) 2020.},

This article contributes to the study of policy adoption by dividing the roles enacted by provincial governments into the four following types: subcontractor, pressure-giver, designer, and co-provider. It utilizes the event history analysis method to examine the effects of the four aforementioned roles on policy adoption by county-level governments on the Old Age Allowance Policy (OAAP). The results suggest that provinces playing the roles of designer, co-provider, and pressure-giver exert a significantly more positive impact on the acceptance of the OAAP by their county-level administrations than provinces performing as subcontractors. Meanwhile, the subcontractor-then-designer role exerts a negative influence on the espousal of the OAAP by county-level governments.

To reveal how and why NEPs are differentially diffused in geographic space, this study proposes a quantitative citation-based approach for exploring NEP diffusion from a spatial-temporal perspective. By identifying a wealth of policy citation links implicit in 7,375 China's NEP documents, we first illustrate spatial structures and locational dynamics of NEP diffusion, while empirically investigating driving factors that shape the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of NEP diffusion. The results indicate that: (i) the top-down pattern is the most critical spatial pattern of NEP diffusion in China, with the highest diffusion speed, diffusion intensity, and policy innovation degree; (ii) NEP diffusion exhibits a rapidly increasing trend, accompanied by the gradually strengthening spatial pattern of the “eastern>central>western”; (iii) some local socioeconomic, contextual, and energy usage conditions are responsible for the spatial heterogeneity of policy diffusion. Our study provides valuable implications for policymakers to strategically craft adequate policy-making and differentiated promotion strategies for new energy sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

A comparative case study of policy innovations in China highlights that if higher-level governments perceive that they own the innovation copyright, they act as proactive facilitators, and if higher-level governments perceive that the innovation copyright belongs to local governments, they are involved as political backers.

This paper compares the historical developmental trajectories and identifies factors of the transitions of the actual practices of solidarity - the scope of community, the scope of interdependence, and the costs of joint action - in the health and LTC sectors in four East Asian countries: Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. Methods: Comparative policy analysis. Results: Healthcare tends to be considered a universal value such that its boundary should include all residents, while LTC is closer to an entitlement of citizens. The differing solidarity reflects path dependency as well as historical legacies and policy diffusion between the health and LTC sectors. In both health and LTC sectors, the costs involved in collective service provision are not distributed evenly between generations. Discussion: Centralized governance is a prevailing feature of health and LTC sectors in East Asia, allowing solidarity-based institutional arrangements to be established without an overall sense of solidarity. The relationship between solidarity and health and LTC systems is complex and dynamic. © 2022},

	abstract = {The legalization of medical marijuana in states of the United States is currently a controversial topic. Despite conflict with the federal government, 33 states have legalized medical marijuana and other states are currently considering adopting the law by the year 2019. Why do some US states adopt medical marijuana laws (MMLs) and others do not? This study examines the diffusion of MMLs by analysing policy adoption from morality and economic development policy perspectives. This study finds that the morality perspectives of states–religious groups, citizens' liberal ideology, and a ballot initiative process–have a significant effect on the adoption of medical marijuana laws. Economic indicators–fiscal capacity growth, incarceration, and the cost of the justice system–also have a significant effect on adoption. Marijuana users and the state regulatory environment are also important predictors of the diffusion. Overall, this study finds that the adoption and diffusion of MMLs is mainly determined by the opinions of citizens rather than the political ideology of elected officials or the government’s fiscal health conditions. In addition, the study finds that the multidimensional policy model provides a better explanation for this than either of the single policy perspective models. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This study aims to redress this, by analysing the shifting ideational drivers of AML policy in Singapore over the past 31 years through a thematic analysis of Singapore’s parliamentary debates (Hansard). Design/methodology/approach: Through a thematic analysis of Singapore's Hansard over the past 31 years, this study seeks to present a social constructivist perspective of AML policy adoption in Singapore. Findings: The thematic analysis reveals how the internal driving forces of AML policy in Singapore have shifted, from the idea of “crime prevention” in the early 1990s, to the symbolic value of “international norm compliance” by the 2010s. Research limitations/implications: This constructivist perspective of AML policy adoption is particularly useful in complementing the existing materialist theories of AML policy diffusion and allows us to better appreciate the historical nuances of AML policy transfer across the globe. Practical implications: This research will provide a useful comparative case study for other policy mobility scholars interested in presenting a constructivist account of AML policy adoption in different jurisdictions. Originality/value: There is no literature in the field of policy mobility, explaining the diffusion/transfer of AML policy from a social constructivist perspective. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

At the same time, it shows that the model of RPL transferred to LMICs is derived from the specific relations between labour markets and education and training systems in donor countries, where VET qualifications are often critical to accessing positions in the labour market, which is often not the case in LMICs. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Social policy development trajectories in post-colonial sub-Saharan African states deviate from those in highly industrialized countries. Recent research endeavours established broad patterns of global interdependencies dating back to colonialism. This article contributes to these efforts by presenting a case study of the dynamics animating social policy development in Cameroon. It examines the progressive evolution of global determinants and their impacts on Cameroon’s welfare system over three periods: (1) decolonialization and post-colonial restructuring in the mid-20th century, (2) structural adjustment in response to the 1980s’ debt crisis and (3) the contemporary era of market liberalization driven by accelerated economic globalization. The research draws on a mixed-methods approach involving a document analysis and a survey administered in 400 rural households. Findings indicate that horizontal interdependencies were predominant in the establishment phase of Cameroon’s national social insurance scheme, but eventually gave way to vertical interdependencies in the 1980s. Recent efforts to advance economic liberalization represent a return to horizontal transnational forces, given the growing influence of multinational corporations on the country’s social security landscape. The study reinforces existing research insights in showing that, unlike social protection in the global north, social policy dynamics in Africa tend to actively contribute to the marginalization of underprivileged groups. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Policy transfer scholars have been at the forefront of work to recognise that the dynamics of policy-making do not stop at the border, nor are they neat, linear learning processes. In spanning the domestic and state, it is argued, we must recognise both the increasing resonance of non-domestic influences and the complexity of how policies are adapted and assembled, and adapt our prevailing theories of domestic policy-making accordingly. Theorising these dynamics is, therefore, a pressing concern of this chapter. Here, a family of analytical approaches to policy transfer concepts is explored, including most prominently lesson-drawing, policy diffusion, policy convergence and policy assemblage. Recent innovations in the policy mobilities and assemblages literature have innovated approaches to understanding the policy creation process as one that hinges on the interplay of identities, subjectivities and circumstance. The aim of this chapter is to situate the book within a critical position on the empirics of policy transfer: here I suggest that it is not possible to understand, much less explain, the phenomenon of policy transfer by analytically divorcing ‘transfer’ processes from their embedding in the broader political context of public policy development. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Taxing land based on the value associated with its current use in agriculture rather than its full market value can confer substantial tax savings for landowners, affecting land use patterns. Using time-to-event models, we find that the secular trend toward urbanization across all fifty states was a driving force behind the spread of UVA policies. In particular, increasing secular trends in agricultural land values (associated with urbanization) provide a strong motivation for agriculture to pursue UVA, and this factor appears to be the key driver of UVA adoption throughout all of our models. We delve deeper, hoping to understand underlying factors through which UVA is spread across states. We consider the literature on policy diffusion as well as factors suggested by models of collective action, based on concentrated benefits and dispersed costs. Once land values are accounted for, the role of these underlying factors is generally inconclusive. One exception is the relationship between agriculture's share of state GDP and UVA adoption. Here, a clear negative relationship is found; that is, UVA adoption is more rapid in states where agriculture's share of state GDP is smaller. This result is at odds with traditional voting models where the median voter, likely not an agricultural landowner, would be expected to favor non-adoption of UVA policies. © 2022},

Policy citations signify the flow of specific legislative knowledge in the legal system, which can provide traceable and measurable footprints for tracing the path of policy progress. To this end, this paper proposes a quantitative citation-based research framework for inspecting the patterns and evolution process of policy diffusion. First, time-varying policy citation networks at different stages are constructed by extracting citing/cited links of policies embedded in the textual content of policy documents. Pattern characteristics, topic dynamics, and historical trajectories of policy diffusion are then revealed by scrutinizing succinct structures of policy citation networks. An experimental study of large-scale new energy policies (NEPs) in China confirms the reliability of the citation-based approach in tracking policy diffusion. The introduced approach enriches the current methodology for policy research and provides valuable references for policymakers to judge their policymaking process. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

The authors argue that party family conditions transnational policy learning when it makes information on the positions of sister parties more readily available and relevant. Both conditions apply to social democratic parties. Unlike other party families, social democrats have faced major competitive challenges since the 1970s and they exhibit exceptionally strong transnational organizations-factors, the authors contend, that uniquely facilitate cross-national policy learning from successful parties within the family. The authors analyze parties' policy positions using spatial methods and find that social democratic parties are indeed exceptional because they emulate one another across borders more than do Christian democratic and conservative parties. These findings have important implications for our understanding of political representation and of social democratic parties' election strategies over the past forty years.

We have examined key events and the issuances of related laws and regulations by Chinese governments. Our contributions are twofold: (a) Our analysis and results show that the diffusion models evolve over the different stages of a life cycle of an innovation, contrasting to the literature results that diffusion models remain the same for their studied innovations. Due to major diverse characteristics among different adopter categories over a life cycle of an innovation, we argue that it is appropriate and necessary to apply different diffusion models on different adopter categories, which is missing in the current literature. (b) We find a first bottom-up and then top-down synthesis approach as an effective, efficient diffusion process for both fitting local needs (i.e., effective) and adopting innovations rapidly nationwide (i.e., efficient). © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

On the year that the OECD celebrates its 62nd anniversary, (the OECD was founded with this name on 14 December 1960 by 20 countries, following the establishment of the former European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) in April 1948) and by comparing two different countries, this article analyses the extent to which the OECD has been and is an “imperial agent” in Portuguese and Finnish HE policies. By cross-comparing the OECD reports of both HE systems, the empirical data shows how the OECD proposes neoliberal reforms based on three main components of neoliberalism: market, management and performativity in different countries. Taking these proposals into account, Portugal and Finland undertook similar HE legislative reforms despite their geographical, historical, cultural and economic differences. The data reveal a convergence in HE policies in these countries, anticipating the reinforcement of neoliberal policies at the national level. © 2022 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from the Bureau van Dijk's (BvD) Orbis global database. The data were analysed using a spatial econometric model and the Cobb–Douglas production function. Findings: This study reveals that hotels located inside the buffer zone of points of tourist interest achieve better economic outcomes than hotels located outside the buffer. Furthermore, the results show that there is a direct and indirect spatial spillover effect in the hotel industry. Practical implications: The results provide valuable information for identifying areas where the agglomeration of hotels will produce a spillover effect on hotel revenue and the area of influence of location characteristics. This information is relevant for hotels already established in a destination or when seeking a location for a new hotel. Social implications: The results of this study can help city planners in influencing the distribution of hotels to fit desired patterns and improve an area's spatial beauty.

This study moves beyond these approaches by exploring factors that influence adoption as well as those that influence the content of a policy or policy goal intensity. Through the exploration of the first “wave” of state GHG reduction targets during the early 2000s, we create an innovative policy commitment variable that standardizes state emissions targets and explores the specific factors influencing these mitigation goals. Our results suggest that internal political factors (Democratic control of the legislature), lower state carbon dioxide emissions and dependency on coal production increases the likelihood of target adoption. However, the degree of GHG reduction commitments (content) are dependent on both internal and external factors, such as neighboring states adoption, carbon dioxide emission levels, citizen ideology, environmental interest groups, natural gas production and solar energy potential. These results support the growing literature on differentiating adoption and the content of a policy when analyzing the spread of policy ideas. Additionally, it suggests the limitations of states as climate leaders. © 2021 Policy Studies Organization},

With the importance of cities’ sustainability efforts, scholars have increasingly explored what factors motivate local governments to implement voluntary sustainability programs by focusing on internal government and community characteristics. However, what is missing in the previous discussion is whether city governments respond to sustainability efforts by other government entities, especially neighboring local governments. Drawing on institutional and policy diffusion theories, we analyzed the sustainability programs of 251 suburban cities in 66 metropolitan areas. We find that suburban cities are likely to consider sustainability efforts of central cities in the same metropolitan area when determining the extent to which they implement their sustainability programs. However, they are not necessarily responsive to sustainability efforts of nearby suburban cities. Our research sheds light on how local governments’ sustainability policy decisions are affected by their relationships with other local governments. It also provides policy implications for the important role of central cities in facilitating collective sustainability efforts in metropolitan areas. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Based on the reference relationship in the policy literature, we build a large sample of intellectual property policy diffusion networks in China and present the trends and characteristics of government agencies’ policy diffusion. The results show that intellectual property policy diffusion in China is positively related to many institutional factors, for example, network positioning, authority, economic development level, and policy timeliness, but it is not significantly correlated with geographical proximity. Points for practitioners: This study helps to understand how government relationships affect policy diffusion in this particular political environment in China.

We find that most countries adopted restrictions within a few days only and that restrictions on internal mobility had been introduced prior to restrictions on cross-border mobility, but that the latter have been more persistent. Furthermore, we observe an evolution from great variation of policy choices at the outset of the pandemic towards convergence. Analyzing the mobility restrictions through a policy diffusion lens, we find tentative evidence for interdependent policy-making especially in the temporal patterns of adoption.

Answering these questions, this chapter makes two contributions to the literature of regulatory governance and policy diffusion. First, it provides a qualitative evidence of the global spread of eleven regulatory governance innovations, here defined as innovations that enhance transparency, openness, and accountability as well as the use of scientific knowledge in the legislation process. This qualitative analysis shows that across the globe there has been a certain extent of Americanization in the way governments make regulations. Second, this chapter reviews nine time-series cross-sectional analyses concerning the adoption of these regulatory governance innovations. By arranging statistical side effects in categories of internal determinants (administrative, political and socio-economic) and two modes of policy diffusion (geographical proximity and vertical), this research synthesis finds that scholars have integrated diffusion with the internal determinants of adoption. The vote-counting procedure shows that diffusion promoted by international organizations is the most frequent statistically significant explanation across the nine quantitative analyses. © Osmany Porto de Oliveira 2021.},

Commitments to the agenda have emerged in South America in recent years, and this article critically examines what governments understand and indicate as appropriate ideas and practices for engaging with the global WPS architecture. By considering the specific security challenges experienced in the region, the article interrogates the extent to which South American countries have been emulating or innovating in terms of the content of NAPs. We argue that, despite some innovative elements that are bubbling up from these documents, the appropriation of the agenda by governments has mostly emulated traditional “peace” and “security” frames that are notably at odds with the insecurities and realities facing South American women. As feminist research gains new impetus with the twentieth anniversary celebrations of UNSCR 1325, our findings provide new insights into the workings of this agenda in a region that has been under-explored within WPS scholarship. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We extend the focus of policy innovation research from policy inventors to followers by focusing on the diffusion and adoption of the “One Visit at Most” policy in China. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used to summarize the core factors affecting the reinvention of this policy by provincial governments in China. The results verify the characteristics of political systems are important factors in the provincial government’s policy reinvention. The vertical intergovernmental relation is the necessary condition to influence the policy reinvention. The combination of the factors for horizontal intergovernmental relations, the geographical leadership mobility of governors, and the characteristics of the government’s own economic environment also affect the provincial government’s policy reinvention. This study contributes the unique characteristics of the Chinese system and important theoretical developments to the study of policy reinvention within the broader policy innovation literature. © 2021, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.},

	abstract = {The education sector in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has experienced a surge of neoliberal reforms over the past few decades, primarily led by the World Bank (WB). One of these reform agendas has been to “decrease standards” or “destandardize” educational responsibilities and policies by devolving educational systems to subnational and school levels. Diffused through different mechanisms, such as conditional aid and the “what works” mantra, we know little about the growth and nature of these reforms, but they may have significant socioeconomic consequences. This is the first study to investigate the destandardization reforms implemented by the WB in the educational systems of 99 historical and present LMICs. Results show that about 63 percent of WB project components in primary and secondary education have focused on destandardizing educational systems at subnational and school levels. Growth of these reforms at the subnational level slowed between the mid-1990s and the early 2000s but sharply increased at the school level since the late 1980s. I argue that the latter could be due to a global emphasis on school-based intervention, an urge for aid effectiveness, and a strategy to spread democratic values in micro-social units. I provide evidence of how homogeneous strategies of supranational organizations diffuse heterogeneous educational systems of nation-states because of aid dependency. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Based on the original policy innovations introduced and adopted by the local government, this paper discovers the independent policy innovations and the applied policy innovations. Results show that there are about 4 original policy innovations in each city, only a third of the policy innovations are actually implemented, and nearly half of the cities have no applied policy innovations. The setting of mandatory carbon emission reduction targets at the national level will help local governments to formulate corresponding policies and achieve carbon emission reduction targets through policy innovation. The internal comparison of these policy innovations between different cities can promote low-carbon urban policy diffusion and learning.

The article inductively identifies the ‘outsider policy entrepreneur’ mechanism of policy reform. LTC in Poland is a negative case (or breakdown) of this mechanism, which occurs when a policy entrepreneur has enough political influence to initiate a formal reform proposal, but not enough to convince decision-makers to adopt it. The article combines an examination of the role of policy entrepreneurs in social policy change with an analysis of their interactions with domestic and foreign epistemic communities. Through showing how ‘foreign’ policy models are used by policy entrepreneurs to pursue domestic reform, the study contributes to the literature on transnational policy diffusion/transfer. The analysis is based on document analysis and 16 semi-directed expert interviews, which were used to process trace the explained outcome (failed reforms). The article concludes that the mechanism failures were due to the fact that involved policy entrepreneurs did not convince decision-makers of the need to reform LTC. Specifically, the contribution identifies two features of the political context in illiberal post-transition polities that interrupt the persuasion efforts of outsider policy entrepreneurs—the impossibility of inter-partisan cooperation and continuity, and the declining role of Western policy models as catalysts for change. © 2021 The Author.

This article offers a multilevel theory of diffusion and local incorporation that overcomes some of the conceptual problems of existing answers to this question including those provided by world polity theory, global field theory, policy diffusion scholarship, and research on cultural globalization. The theory conceives the world as polycentric, divided into multiple, overlapping domains of bounded connectivity within which diffusion unfolds. These domains differ in their basic characteristics, such as their degrees of institutionalization, which determine which mechanisms of diffusion (such as coercion or imitation) will be at work and how widely and quickly templates will be initially adopted within them. Depending on the intrinsic properties of templates as well as the local configuration of power, a template may further spread among a population and eventually be incorporated into local cultural and organizational fabrics. Charting new territory of theoretical inquiry and future empirical exploration, the article highlights three cumulative and long-term consequences of diffusion: layered cultural and institutional complexity at the local level, polythetic areas of cultural and institutional similarity at the regional level, and a multichanneled network of diffusion at the global level. © 2021 by The University of Chicago.

To illustrate this claim, we analyse the reception and policy impact of this report over time in three different welfare states: Canada, Denmark, and France.

	abstract = {This study aims to deepen our understanding of social investment expansion proposing a political learning mechanism to link existing institutional and political explanations. When resources are limited, increased spending in social investment often comes at the expense of politically costly retrenchment of established social insurance policies. Previous studies suggest that this trade-off results in existing entitlements crowding out new policies, and that party ideology plays less of a role in determining social policy expansion. I argue that this is because parties face an electoral dilemma, as individual preferences for social investment and social insurance have been shown to differ between groups that partly overlap in their voting behaviour. Applying a policy diffusion framework to the analysis of childcare expenditure, this study proposes that policymakers learn from the political consequences of past decisions made by their foreign counterparts and update their policy choice accordingly. The econometric analysis of OECD data on childcare expenditure shows that governments tend to make spending decisions that follow those of ideologically similar cabinets abroad and that left-wing governments with a divided electorate tend to reduce childcare expenditure if a previous expansionary decision of a foreign incumbent is followed by an electoral defeat. The findings have implications for the study of the politics of social policy development. © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press},

Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of policy diffusion present unique challenges that empirical researchers often neglect. Scholars often use temporally lagged spatial lags (TLSL)—such as the number (or percentage) of prior adopters in a neighborhood—to test various mechanisms of delayed policy diffusion but are largely unaware of two under appreciated issues. First, the effects are not limited to one time period but persist over time by changing the future value of neighboring observations. Second, minor, yet common, choices in model specification—such as omitting spatially correlated and/or autoregressive covariates—can increase the risk of falsely inferring that the outcome is a result of spatial diffusion. Indeed, we offer two applications where small changes to the model specification of an otherwise well-specified model result in drastically different inferences about policy diffusion. We argue that scholars should avoid haphazardly including TLSLs without considerable theoretical justification, and we conclude on an optimistic note by offering straightforward solutions and new software to address these issues. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization},

The study of policy innovation, however, has often focused on enactments rather than earlier stages of the legislative process, in which the actions of a bill’s advocates may be especially crucial. In this paper, I ask who the champions of policy innovations are, focusing on two categories of legislators whose expertise makes them likely advocates: individuals with relevant professional backgrounds and individuals serving on relevant legislative committees. However, I also argue that the impact of expertise is conditional: as policies diffuse more widely, the role of expertise fades in importance, and champions can come from the broader legislative membership. To test these claims, I examine bill authorship and cosponsorship across 14 criminal justice policies between 1993 and 2004. I find that committee membership and professional background are indeed powerful predictors, but that their impact decreases as more states adopt the policy. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization},

	abstract = {A significant body of work has emerged on the transnational diffusion of tax policy reforms. This literature largely focuses on the degree to which tax policy makers strategically respond to competitors, rationally learn from successful nations, emulate peer nations, or succumb to coercive pressures for policy change from dominant nations or international organizations. More recent research employs new methods to explore how domestic institutions and international and domestic political actors condition competitive responsiveness, learning, and emulation. After an exposition of theory, I survey this literature on tax policy diffusion and find that while there is clear evidence of strategic competition, learning, and emulation in tax policy reform, most policy diffusion is highly conditioned by the domestic institutions and political dynamics of adopting polities. I conclude with a review of promising trends in research on tax policy diffusion that should help us better understand the politics of taxation in the twenty-first century. © Lukas Hakelberg and Laura Seelkopf 2021.},

	abstract = {Background: Transnational networks such as Communities of Practice (CoPs) are flourishing, yet their role in diffusing health systems reforms has been seldom investigated. Over the past decade, performance-based financing (PBF) has rapidly spread in Africa. This study explores how, through the PBF Community of Practice’s attributes, structure, and strategies, PBF diffusion was fostered in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: Informed by the diffusion entrepreneurs’ (DEs) framework dimensions, we used a mixed methods convergent design to investigate how the attributes, structure, and strategies of this community fostered the diffusion of PBF. The quantitative strand of work included firstly a semantic discourse analysis of textual data extracted from CoP’s online discussion forum (n = 1346 posts). Secondly, the relational data extracted from these 1346 forum posts was examined using social network analysis (SNA). We confronted these quantitative results with a thematic analysis of qualitative interviews (n = 40) and data extracted from the CoP’s key documentation (n = 17). Results: CoP members’ attributes included: representation systems anchored in clinical and economic sciences, strong expectations that the CoP would boost professional visibility and career, and significant health systems knowledge and social resources. The CoP’s core group, dominated by high-income country (HIC) members, critically matched PBF principles to major health systems issues in Africa. The broad consensus in online PBF thematic discussions created a strong sense of community, a breeding ground for emulation among CoP members. The CoP also sought to produce and promote experiential knowledge exchanges about PBF amongst African practitioners. Findings from network analyses showed that the promoted Africa-driven community was led by HIC members, although their prominence tended to decrease with time. Conclusion: This empirical research highlighted some of the constituting features, structure, and strategies of policy networks in influencing health policy diffusion. Despite good intentions to disrupt the established governance landscape, influential actors coming from HICs continued to drive the framing, and shaped health systems policy experimentation, emulation, and learning in African countries. Beyond mere knowledge exchange platforms, CoP can act as meaningful transnational policy networks pursuing the diffusion of health systems reforms, such as PBF. © 2021 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy (RE) has received much attention for feeding the growing energy demand from developing countries without compromising the global efforts to combat climate change. For faster diffusion, countries seek substantial involvement by private firms in the RE diffusion process. In this paper, we show how different RE policy instruments influence private investments given the diffusion stages of developing countries and the origin of investment. Using the World Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure Database, we constructed a country-year panel of 80 developing countries for the period 1996–2016. We found that regulatory instruments such as obligation schemes are more effective than feed-in-tariffs in mobilizing private investment in developing countries, particularly in the formative diffusion stage. Further analysis demonstrates that obligation schemes mobilize foreign investment, while upfront cost recovery through grants and subsidies mobilize domestic investment. Moving from the formative to the growth stage, strategic planning also helps developing countries receive private investments, particularly for domestic sources. Multilateral support, prior knowledge, and economy-wide market stability in the host country are major factors for mobilization. In particular, foreign investment seeks a guarantee of continuous RE business operation, rather than government assistance on cost recovery. The results provide insights to developing country governments and international organizations with policy strategies to facilitate RE expansion in developing countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There are 45 countries which have adopted a kind of carbon pricing policy – either a carbon tax or entered a cap–and–trade or both – while other countries do not have such policies implemented. As carbon pricing policies are considered as an effective lever to mitigate climate change, there is a need to understand what factors are motivating countries to adopt a carbon pricing policies and what factors might limit such endeavor. There is thus a need to examine how carbon pricing policies get adopted cross–nationally to examine pathways for climate change mitigation and incentivize other countries to follow. In this study, a model combining both internal and external diffusion factors is built (how one countries adoption of a carbon pricing policy affects another) to identify factors of adoption of carbon pricing policies. An Event History Analysis approach was used by compiling data for 127 countries running from 1990 to 2019. The findings show that the carbon pricing policies diffuse mainly through learning from neighboring countries and to a slight degree, by imitation. With a split sample analysis to account for policy heterogeneity, it was seen that both the carbon tax and the cap–and–trade system diffuse through the learning mechanism, however for the cap–and–trade, the policy can also diffuse through coercion and normative pressure if countries are part of EU. It was also found from the regressions that adoption of the carbon pricing policy by a country is motivated by a democratic political regime and from the level of coal production in the country. Among other groups, this finding is important for the international climate advocacy groups to decide which countries are more likely to adopt such policies where they can push forward this agenda. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Especially since 2010, conservative interests’ dominance at advancing their preferred policies across U.S. states has been clear, with large and escalating impacts in education. Although adversaries on the political left remain in catch-up mode, there have been auspicious developments. This study focuses on one of these, seeking to understand a uniquely positioned progressively state-focused policy organization called State Innovation Exchange (SiX). It was aimed to a) provide a valuable case study of perhaps the leading organization in this space, focusing on understanding its education policy footprint; b) further understandings of conflicts, tensions, and responses on the political left relative to education policy; and c) generate insights into contemporary sub-national policy mobility. We interviewed nine key stakeholders and analyzed electronic materials to address two research questions. Findings demonstrate SiX fulfills four main purposes: 1) building and sustaining cross-state progressive power; 2) acting as a counter; 3) fostering progressive leader development; and 4) advancing progressive policies/ideas. SiX shows an economics-focused agenda emphasizing working-and middle-class families, and education policy has not been a major, consistent area of emphasis. SiX does, however, play unique roles in education (as in other areas) by connecting state legislators and supporting their work. Specific to education, we surfaced some challenges SiX has faced in building alignment around a shared vision. We suggest, if SiX or a similarly situated organization can develop a clear education philosophy and policy agenda, it will be more effective at advancing its preferred policies, and in countering those being advanced by adversaries. Absent such shifts, we project continued conservative dominance of education policy at the state level. © 2022, Arizona State University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {While previous research on higher education policy diffusion often conceptualizes diffusion as occuring across neighboring governments, we conceptualize policy diffusion as also occuring across pairs of governments (dyads) regardless of geographic proximity. We apply both conceptualizations and use survival analysis techniques to examine factors associated with state adoption of performance funding equity metrics. Results show that the proportion of neighbors with equity metrics is unrelated to the likelihood of adopting a metric for either the 2- or 4-year sector, suggesting no evidence of policy diffusion across borders. The directed dyad analysis reveals that states are less likely to adopt a 4-year metric when the other state in the pair already operates a 4-year metric, indicating that states look beyond neighbors in policy avoidance behaviors. Internal state factors such as higher levels of legislative professionalism and greater enrollment of underrepresented minority and low-income students increase the likelihood of policy adoption. A state is less likely to imitate the adoption of 2-year equity metrics in another state when the pair show greater differences in legislative professionalism, minority and low-income student enrollment, income per capita, and income inequality. Our research highlights the utility of quantitatively modeling policy diffusion across governmental units that are distantly located, especially for higher education policy components that are nationally visible. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Although research has shown that refugees have recently been recast as an economic benefit for non-Western host states, little scholarly work exists on whether and how such a normative change is adopted across regions. In this article, we identify the diffusion of refugee rent-seeking behaviour, namely the use of host states’ geopolitical position as leverage to extract revenue from other states in exchange for maintaining refugees within their borders. We identify three types of diffusion–learning, cooperation and emulation–occurring at state, regional and international levels across the Global South. Drawing on a range of primary sources, we demonstrate the working of these three types across a range of empirical examples drawn from the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Overall, we identify a rising trend in the commodification of forced migration across refugee rentier states, while highlighting the need for further interregional research on policy diffusion outside the Global North. © 2021 The Author(s).

As aspirant powers, Russia and China have recently launched cultural institutes of their own with the aim of improving their international reputations. However, the location and operations of the Confucius Institutes and Russkiy Mir Institutes often seem to run counter to these aims. Drawing on policy diffusion theory (PDT), we argue that these choices are less the product of strategic calculation than of policy emulation and decoupling. Using a mixed methods approach, we show that, while the Confucius Institutes and Russkiy Mir Institutes were modelled after their Western counterparts (emulation), China and Russia have operated their institutes in ways that go against the principles of cultural diplomacy (decoupling). An analysis of field research on these institutes suggests more overall decoupling with Confucius Institutes than with Russkiy Mir Institutes, which might help account for the relatively greater backlash against the Confucius Institutes in their host countries. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Adapting to some level of climate change has become unavoidable. However, there is surprisingly limited systematic knowledge about whether and how adaptation policies have diffused and could diffuse in the future. Most existing adaptation studies do not explicitly examine policy diffusion, which is a form of interdependent policy-making among jurisdictions at the same or across different levels of governance. To address this gap, we offer a new interpretation and assessment of the extensive adaptation policy literature through a policy diffusion perspective; we pay specific attention to diffusion drivers and barriers, motivations, mechanisms, outputs, and outcomes. We assess the extent to which four motivations and related mechanisms of policy diffusion—interests (linked with learning and competition), rights and duties (tied to coercion), ideology, and recognition (both connected with emulation)—are conceptually and empirically associated with adaptation. We also engage with adaptation policy characteristics, contextual conditions (e.g., problem severity) and different channels of adaptation policy diffusion (e.g., transnational networks). We demonstrate that adaptation policy diffusion can be associated with different mechanisms, yet many of them remain remarkably understudied. So are the effects of adaptation policy diffusion in terms of changes in vulnerability and resilience. We thus identify manifold avenues for future research, and provide insights for practitioners who may hope to leverage diffusion mechanisms to enhance their adaptation efforts.

First, a Delphi study surveyed scholars of Internet governance and diffusion studies in political science and sociology about potential causes that drive states to implement technical Internet filtering practices. The second step tested the potential cause that the experts deemed to be most relevant with a comparative case study between South Korea, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. On the basis of the OpenNet Initiative’s empirical tests for technical Internet filtering, the study established a robust relationship between the implementation of state-mandated technical Internet filtering practices and similar problems of role-equivalent states as a predictor of international policy diffusion. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization},

Second, the mechanisms lack conceptual clarity when it comes to distinguishing them from one another. Third, the dominant typology of mechanism suffers from internal theoretical incoherence.

This paper aims to investigate the relationship between state-level, LGBT anti-discrimination policies, and high school student well-being by analyzing patterns of policy diffusion and the policies’ effects on four measures of students’ well-being: self-reported (1) experiences with bullying at school, (2) cyberbullying, (3) school absences due to feeling unsafe at school, and (4) grades. Using data from the Center for Disease Control’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System and linear regression analysis with time and state fixed effects, the results of this analysis provide evidence on the benefits of expansive civil rights legislation for LGBT individuals and the spread of its externalities to students in the U.S. schools. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This study uses data from PISA to explore, firstly, the spatial and temporal diffusion of accountability across OECD countries, and secondly, whether accountability is implemented as a single coherent regime. Using cluster analysis techniques, we find that most countries fall into a ‘Thick’ accountability regime, with widespread use of most forms of accountability tools. However, this regime is not fully coherent, with some countries relying more on horizontal, and others on vertical, forms of accountability. A sizeable minority of countries fall into a ‘Thin’ regime, in which most accountability tools are largely absent. We also find indications of convergence across countries over time. We conclude that while accountability in education is indeed widespread, and increasingly so, it is not a universally dominant regime. © 2020 The Author(s).

From the literature on policy diffusion, we refer here to a process whereby a dominant actor (China) has vigorously promoted a particular strand of its own domestic development policy in other emerging economies. Our focus is on the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, all EU members since 2004. We draw on Etel Solingen's (2012. Of dominoes and firewalls: the domestic, regional, and global politics of international diffusion.

It is the dearth of BRI loans and China-backed infrastructure projects in this sub-region that we seek to explain. Our main finding is that China has been its own biggest firewall in the diffusion of BRI into Central Europe. China needs to formulate policies that surpass the pursuit of its own economic interests and devise approaches that resonate with the more developed status of these three Central European countries. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

As the use of financial innovations has also diffused geographically, policy diffusion impacts local governments as well. Highlighting the conditional effect of finance sector power, which only increases the use of financial innovations in very large councils, as well as the temporal dimension of fiscal and economic stress, we create ample avenues for further research. © 2019 The Authors.

Based on extensive documentary analysis and fieldwork in the Philippines in 2017 and 2018, we argue that the targeting system has in fact been unable to function according to its primary purpose of identifying the poor and providing them social protection, despite being celebrated precisely for this purpose. This has been partly – but not only – due to the increasingly obsolescent data of the registry, which the political system has been incapable of correcting, leading to stasis at a fairly low level of coverage, at a peak of about 19 percent of national households in 2014 and since subsiding to about 17 percent by 2020, with transfer amounts at a fraction of the food poverty line. This dysfunction has resulted in a quasi-permanent group of cash payment recipients, with little or no reflection of evolving poverty profiles. This revised reading of the Pantawid and Listahanan, in what might be considered as a strong case to examine social protection performance, brings us back to the perennial problems associated with poverty targeting in even best-case social protection programmes promoted by international donors and organisations. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Introduced in 2018, remediation agreements allow corporate diversion and create an alternative to the prosecution of corporations suspected of criminal wrongdoing.

Drawing on a wide-ranging documentary record, I argue that this reform was the product of transnational lawmaking and the ongoing influence of Canada's international commitments to prohibit and punish foreign bribery. The article shows how international criticism of Canada's lacklustre anti-foreign bribery enforcement record catalyzed cross-national policy diffusion and learning from other states. This led Canada to adopt corporate diversion, which promised greater enforcement, and also led Canada to adopt a form of the practice with legislative and judicial limits that narrowed the chances of any company - including SNC-Lavalin - of obtaining a remediation agreement. © 2021 The Author(s).

It identifies four categories of NSAs–non-governmental organisations (NGOs), civil society organisations (CSOs), academia and the media–as the key actors engaged in regional migration governance processes in West Africa. The paper adopts a social constructivist approach and a multilevel perspective, drawing on interviews, surveys and an extensive analysis of ECOWAS policy documents. The paper argues that invented, invited and instrumentalised spaces for engagement between state and non-state actors in ECOWAS manifest in a complex web of regional and national interests contributing to regional migration governance from ‘below’. Regional migration governance from below consists of transnational societal networks characterised by the interactions of NSAs across borders to influence policies and practices at the regional level. The analysis reveals that NSA engagement results in reinforcing regional policies, policy diffusion through regional processes and circumventing restrictive national agendas through adopting innovative regional approaches. These results contribute to strengthening the institutional framework for regional migration governance in West Africa. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, it also finds substantial heterogeneity in these conditional effects across State Policy Innovation and Diffusion’s major constituent datasets. In addition, while not completely answering questions about convenience sampling bias, the study shows that the fundamental results do not change with one re-weighting of the results to capture a hypothetical distribution of the population of state policy innovations. The article concludes with future directions for the study of both policy diffusion within American federalism and cross-national diffusion. © The Author(s) 2021.},

There are two waves in the diffusion; ‘Environment Basic Ordinance (1996-2007)' and ‘Green Growth Ordinance (2010-2013).' We argue that Korean local governments have increasingly become autonomous and accountable actors that respond to diversified stimulus from surrounding environments, while also concerning about their own needs and capacity. Hence, in adopting ‘Green Growth Ordinances,' competitively adopted in the 2010s, Korean local governments considered more factors than they had done for ‘Environment Basic Ordinances.' Employing event history analysis, we find empirical support for this argument. By comparing the diffusion pattern of the two environmental ordinances, this paper traces changing mechanisms of local environmental governance as well as policy diffusion among Korean local governments. © 2021 Lex localis.},

Utilizing the method of qualitative comparative analysis on the case of River Chief Innovation, this article intends to explore the multiple conjunctural causation of Chinese policy diffusion and the impacts of central recognition. Our findings suggest that interlocal learning and tournament could intimately stimulate Chinese policy diffusion through different combinations. Different governments would adopt innovation for various reasons in a continuum of diffusion mechanisms, involving the technical learning, the championship-induced learning, the mandate-induced learning, and the innovation tournament. Hence, despite the ongoing centralization under Xi, space for local spontaneous learning remains. We also find that central recognition could activate the interlocal tournament and extend the diffusion continuum to the tournament side. Therefore, it facilitates policy diffusion toward governments that lack learning motivations and promotes the local implementation of central preferences. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

We argue that parties that follow foreign leaders will arrive at policy positions closer to their own (domestic) median voter, which increases their electoral support. The analysis is based on a two-stage model specification of parties’ vote shares and suggests that following foreign leaders is a beneficial election strategy in national election because it allows them to better identify the position of their own median voter.

I address this gap by conceptualizing policy transfer and policy diffusion using the multiple streams framework (MSF) and developing hypotheses to connect them. I apply this theorization to explain the limited spread of the energy conservation building code (ECBC) in India by combining a process trace of policy adoption in the embedded case of Andhra Pradesh with a dyadic event history analysis of state-level diffusion during 2012-18. The data for this study are collated from official statistics, elite interviews, news reports, policy documents, and secondary literature. The qualitative analysis shows that policy transfer to Andhra Pradesh occurred when external influence and prior adoption elsewhere were used by a policy entrepreneur to exploit a window of opportunity and couple problem, policy, and politics in the state; the dyadic analysis demonstrates that policy diffusion was influenced by the interaction among the structural characteristics of the problem, policy, and politics streams. I conclude with the implications for research on policy diffusion and the MSF as well as the relevance of the findings for promoting policy innovation for a sustainable energy transition. © 2021 The Authors.

It argues that while strong trading links drive policy diffusion and the alignment of standards, the outcome is not necessarily a strong alignment by follower countries with the standards operating in the export markets they target. Differences in priorities and capabilities may make it difficult to achieve full alignment. Pressure for standards alignment may exist even in the absence of trading relationships. Standards created through learning and emulation may face design and implementation constraints arising from the need to interact with standards in other jurisdictions. Therefore, even though policy diffusion and policy development in different countries may be motivated by similar perceptions of what a regulatory framework might require, variations in the regulations adopted can be observed across countries, which leads to multiple localized regulations. © Institute of Developing Economies (IDE), JETRO 2021.},

In this paper, we use quantitative text analysis to identify constitutional innovation and to investigate patterns of imitation. First, we find substantial textual borrowing between state constitutions. On average, 20 percent of a state’s constitutional language was borrowed directly from another state constitution. Second, states were more likely to borrow text from geographically proximate states, from temporally proximate state constitutions, and from states that shared similar partisan profiles. Finally, we offer a brief discussion of the most influential constitutions as an exploratory example for extending our approach of identifying textual innovation and imitation. These findings offer new contributions to both the study of constitutional design and institutional diffusion. © 2021 University of Utah.},

This article examines the Europeanisation of water policy in Turkey in relation to implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Although some principles of EU water policy have been adopted in Turkey, the WFD has also been subject to significant domestic modification, prompting questions about how and why such patterns of partial implementation occur. In this respect, learning and socialisation within transnational 'instrument constituencies' (ICs) is shown to be an important explanatory factor. It follows that diffusion of EU water policy and the WFD beyond its borders may be enhanced by promoting the capacity for instrument constituency learning-or the 'cognitive environment'-in non-EU countries. © 2020 Water Alternatives Association.},

The mere existence of regulation says little about how strong these regimes are. Drawing on original data collected through an institutional checklist of 21 indicators, we develop an Ethics Regulation Robustness Index to measure the scope of norms, the strictness of sanctions, and the powers granted to oversight and enforcement bodies in 17 European parliaments. Our findings suggest that the externality of the oversight and enforcement is not a good predictor of the robustness of the ethics regulations. © 2022 American Society for Public Administration.},

Single-policy studies incorporate temporal variation, but for only one innovation. Macro-level analyses examine broad patterns, but often by completely pooling across policy and time. This makes it difficult to identify how diffusion patterns change over time, though Walker's early work explicitly identified such temporal instability. This study specifically examines how neighbor and ideological cues change in importance over time using a dataset of 556 policies adopted from 1960 to 2014. While the findings demonstrate the generality of many key internal, external, and policy-level determinants of adoption, there is variation in these effects across time. Most important is the relative stability of ideological similarity between adopters and declining influence of contiguous neighbors. Further, political polarization plays a role in conditioning neighbor and ideological cues. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization},

The information collected serves to check to what extent participatory budgeting as practiced in the countries involved presents a real attempt to change municipal budgets toward addressing the needs of marginalized groups and to improve decision-making based on local democracy and participation, or whether these processes as such are to be judged to be more important than any output and outcomes. All in all, the practices of PB as they evolved in European countries out of the innovative original as developed in Porto Alegre in the 1990s can be seen neither as a process of policy diffusion nor as a process of policy mimesis. The terminology of participatory budgeting remained, but the goals and tools to achieve the goals resulted only in marginal changes in the status quo in municipalities in European countries practicing participatory budgeting, instead of resulting in radical changes to increase spending in favor of marginalized groups. Participatory budgeting in selected European countries is far away from the level of “best practice” in which local democracy and participation are promoted. However, it is also not possible to conclude that all experiences are just “trivial pursuits”. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Despite the strong uptake of the SUMP concept, mobility-related problems persist in European municipalities. Linking theoretical approaches to understand the diffusion of policies with empirical findings from working with cities in the SUMP context, this article explores channels of policy diffusion and investigates shortcomings related to the respective approaches. Studies on the diffusion, the transfer and the convergence of policies identify formal hierarchy, coercion, competition, learning and networking, and the diffusion of international norms as channels for policy transfer. The findings which are presented in this paper are twofold: First, the paper finds evidence that the Commission takes different roles and uses all mechanisms in parallel, albeit with different intensity. It concludes that the approaches to explain policy diffusion are not competing or mutually exclusive but are applied by the same actor to address different aspects of a policy field, or to reach out to different actors. Second, the article provides first evidence of factors that limit the mechanisms’ abilities to directly influence urban mobility systems and mobility behaviour. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {This review provides a fresh look at the strengths and weaknesses of four distinct generations of research on water policy travels. Studies on policy diffusion explicate patterns of adoption across large-n units and are interested in tipping points, early and late adopters, and which policies spread more easily. Diffusion research privileges structural forces such as globalisation and competition over diffusion agents and national-level politics. Policy transfer scholarship is based mainly on small-n case studies and interrogates the ‘what’ and the ‘who’ of policy transfer as well as asks into what conditions a policy is transferred. The key premise of this school of research is that transfer decisions are made rationally based on voluntary learning, coercion, or some negotiated motivation. Policy translation scholarship developed as a critique of diffusion and transfer studies. It posits that policies undergo significant transformation when moving through various settings and that this process is intensely political and power-laden. Policy branding is an offshoot of policy translation research. It focuses on branding of policies and policy agents by establishing an explicit link with places and projects. The key focus is on the power of ideas and neoliberal underpinnings of policy travel. These four generations of research are based on contrasting premises about what travels, how and why it travels, and to what effect. The review offers an appraisal of this large and diverse literature and proposes potential complementarities. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Comparative research projects have become one of the main sources of information to investigate national systems of education and to inform education policy making at the national level. However, the way that national education authorities interpret and use the results of these projects may differ substantially among countries. This process, that we refer to as the national interpretation in comparative education, is overlooked in the debate regarding comparative research projects in education. This paper addresses this issue analysing national reports of the OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) from eight different countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada (Alberta), Chile, England, Mexico, Portugal and Spain. The results indicate that the national interpretation and reporting of international comparative data is fairly homogeneous considering the socio-educational diversity of the selected countries. However, our analysis also suggests that reports from English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada, and England) have a higher degree of similarity with the survey’s conceptual framework, whereas national reports from Mexico and Chile showed a lower degree of similarity. Moreover, our analysis reinforces the relevance of understanding countries’ focus and interpretation of evidence produced by international comparative research projects in education. © 2022 International Journal of Academic Medicine and Pharmacy.

Building on qualitative and participatory methods, the analysis unveils the obstacles to franchise reform despite significant progress from 2004 to 2019. Although external voting was not enacted legally, emigrants' voting rights were debated, formally acknowledged, and encouraged. It is not the lack of norm entrepreneurs but the cumulative effect of indecisive actions that perpetuates a counterproductive dynamic and de facto uneven access to this right. An unresolved debate simultaneously advances conversations but precludes compromises, turning resolution deferral into an implicit form of regulating emigrants' political inclusion or exclusion. Presenting original evidence, this study expands existing accounts, highlights the interaction between institutional and social drivers of change, and invites further research on the role of policy diffusion, domestic politics, and timing.  © },

Established in 1910, the NPA was a pioneering government social policy for the time and for the region. Some have argued that the design of the NPA law followed the secular and republican model instituted in France at the end of the nineteenth century when France established the Assistance Publique, particularly regarding the extent of public assistance to the poor, the role of the state in the provision of health care (as opposed to charity-based provision) and the centralization of health-care services (as opposed to a decentralized health-care system). We analyze how these revolutionary ideas were discussed by the technicians and politicians who participated in the process that culminated in the approval of the law in Uruguay discussed these revolutionary ideas. We explore the factors that motivated the creation of the commission that developed the law. We also review available documentation on the drafting of the bill and the parliamentary debate that culminated in its approval. We find that the design of the NPA included many ideas diffused mainly from France. The French model was not simply emulated, however. Rather, the authors of the NPA thoroughly analyzed and considered the features and main consequences of the Assistance Publique, suggesting that diffusion in this case was more a process of learning than of simple mimicry. © },

By comparing the characteristics of countries at the time when they adopted such policies reveals that the country-specific factors affecting their actions are self-reliance rate in energy consumption, energy intensity and cooperation from donor. It also shows that timing of adopting the policy are affected by not only country specific factors, but also international circumstances such as international relations, oil prices, and emerging international regime on climate change. © Institute of Developing Economies (IDE), JETRO 2021.},

However, same-party governments are also more likely to share similar issues, ideological preferences and constituency demands. Establishing a causal link between partisanship and policy learning is difficult. In collaboration with a non-profit organization, this study isolates the role of partisanship in a real policy learning context. As part of a campaign promoting a new policy among local representatives in the United States, the study randomized whether the initiative was endorsed by co-partisans, out-partisans or both parties. The results show that representatives are systematically more interested in the same policy when it is endorsed by co-partisans. Bipartisan initiatives also attract less interest than co-partisan policies, and no more interest than out-partisan policies, even in more competitive districts. Together, the results suggest that ideological considerations cannot fully explain partisan-based learning. The study contributes to scholarship on policy diffusion, legislative signaling and interest group access. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.},

Leveraging data on successful and failed efforts across the U.S. states to adopt renewable portfolio standards (RPS), we show that the cue of ideological similarity matters more for RPS diffusion during adoption than cosponsorship. The result validates copious research that investigates external cues at adoption without considering that such cues might exert stronger influence earlier in lawmaking. Moreover, in devising a method to assess whether legislators are differentially receptive to cues from other states (here, we compared the baseline of adoption against cosponsorship), we provide scholars with a framework to further explore the question of whether external influence may be more pronounced among some legislators than others. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization},

Most studies of policy diffusion—which is the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking in other governments—have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative justifications are not.

Its authors provide an overview of the diffusion of participatory budgeting, and they classify relevant countries in terms of the pace of this diffusion into four different groups: frontrunners, early majority, later majority, and lagging adopters. In addition, they uncover various diffusion mechanisms that have been used. Since the research articles included in this thematic issue unpack various factors that influence the diffusion of the innovative practice of participatory budgeting in the specific settings of Central and Eastern Europe, the main goal of this article is to sum up their crucial findings and formulate several conclusions, including a few avenues for further research. A clear majority of countries in the region have already collected a relevant amount of experience with the adoption and further use of participatory budgeting. An analysis of the individual experiences reveals that the position and characteristics of mayors, organizational resources, and available capacities, as well as the quality of public trust, are likely to be important factors that determine the adoption and use of participatory budgeting in the region. © 2021 The Faculty of Social Sciences University of Ss.

	abstract = {Since 2011, considerable upheavals in domestic politics, shifting regional power balances and international shocks have been greatly affecting Islamist movements and parties coming to the forefront of the political arena in Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco. This Special Issue combines a more theoretical reflection upon the underappreciated interaction of domestic, regional and international factors with an empirical focus on the development of Islamists. It also enriches the case history of comparative politics analyses through the investigation of new relevant rational actors in countries whose political trajectories differ considerably. By opting for an inside-out perspective and actor-centered approach, we aim to overcome the ‘compartmentalization' of the three levels of analysis and the ‘obsession’ with moderation for Islamists. Borrowing a set of mechanisms first identified by social movement and policy diffusion literature, this introduction lays out the analytical framework informing all the contributions which is based on adaptation, learning, competition, and collaboration dynamics. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: As an innovation model for infrastructure and public service delivery, public–private partnership (PPP) has been widely adopted around the world. The knowledge spillover effect and policy diffusion mechanism have played an important role in promoting the development of PPP in the context of globalization. A comparative evaluation of the policy and management of PPP in different countries will help to understand the development of PPP, provide decision-making reference for PPP policy embedded with specific national conditions of each country, and also contribute to the global PPP knowledge body. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the principle of comparability and representativeness, this study selected three countries, namely, China, India, and the United Kingdom for comparative analysis. This study first introduced the policy process and key institutions of PPP in three countries. Secondly, a comparative analysis of the development characteristics and application of PPP was conducted based on the official database of three countries. Finally, the differences, influencing factors and development trends of international PPP development were analyzed based on the comparative research results, and suggestions for PPP policy and management were put forward. Findings: The research results indicate the development fluctuation and unbalanced spatial distribution of PPPs are a common phenomenon in the three countries. The UK has a significant impact on the policy and development of PPP in other countries. However, under the combined influence of factors such as economic, urbanization, political regime and social culture, there are significant differences in the PPP institution, application, and project characteristics in various countries. Due to international exchanges and knowledge spillovers, as well as the promotion of intermediaries, the development of PPP worldwide tends to converge. Practical implications: Through conducting an international comparison of PPPs based on project data, this study provides a detailed and visualized overview of PPPs and a better understanding of PPP policy and management in different countries. The findings will be of interest to PPP investors, officers, practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and analysts. It enriches the portrait of global PPP market research, helps governments to improve the design of PPP institutions and policies, and provides references for decision-making of international investors when stepping into a new market. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to systematically compare and analyze the global PPP difference and development trend based on PPP project databases of different countries. Different from previous PPP comparative research based on perception data, the project data-based comparative analysis in this study is helpful to understand the characteristics, interrelations, and trends of global PPP development and enrich the existing PPP knowledge body. This study also proposes that it is possible to establish a global PPP knowledge community in the context of globalization and global production network. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper makes the case for studying transnational partisan cooperation in the European multilevel space, focusing in particular on the phenomenon of “party policy diffusion.” At the heart of the paper is a conceptual discussion of party policy diffusion in the EU. Specifically, we look at the (1) aims that lead parties to learn from or emulate parties in other countries; (2) the mechanisms through which this may work; and (3) the wider implications of this practice both for domestic and European politics. Drawing on this conceptual discussion, the paper then goes on to offer leads as to how the phenomenon of party policy diffusion can be studied in the European multilevel space. To this end, we briefly point to possible ways of testing hypotheses about party policy diffusion using spatially explicit modeling strategies such as spatial regression models and exponential random graph models for transnational party networks. © 2019, © 2019 Elections, Public Opinion & Parties.},

This article uses an original data set of media coverage to examine the ways in which salience and media portrayals of scientific uncertainty affect the agenda-setting process for scientific policy issues. We build upon two scholarly literatures by incorporating research on the use of science in the policy process into the study of policy diffusion among the American states. In doing so, we develop a framework for how media portrayals of scientific information can affect agenda setting. We test this framework on three scientific issues: Genetically modified food labeling, human papillomavirus vaccinations, and indoor tanning. Our results indicate that lawmakers introduce more legislation on salient issues, while higher reported levels of scientific uncertainty reduce the likelihood of bill introductions. This finding illustrates the potential impact of national media coverage as an information transmission mechanism and the necessity of treating policy characteristics as subject to change over time. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization},

Due to the features of the pandemic, which spread over time and space, governments could decide whether or not to follow policy choices made by leaders of countries affected by the virus before them. In this study, we aim to empirically model the adoption of NPIs during the first wave of COVID-19 in the 14 European countries with more than 10 million inhabitants, in order to detect whether a policy diffusion mechanism occurred. By means of a multivariate approach based on Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis, we manage to derive three clusters representing different behaviour models to which the different European countries belong in the different periods of the first wave: pre-pandemic, summer relaxation and deep-lockdown scenarios. These results bring a two-fold contribution: on the one hand, they may help us to understand differences and similarities among European countries during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and guide future quantitative or qualitative studies; on the other, our findings suggest that with minor exceptions (such as Sweden and Poland), different countries adopted very similar policy strategies, which are likely to be due more to the unfolding of the pandemic than to specific governmental strategies. © 2022 The Society for Policy Modeling},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw upon policy documents to zoom in on the main political, institutional and economic factors that help to explain Estonia's departure from extreme fiscal conservatism in the midst of the global pandemic. Findings: The authors found the key political factors to be the party composition of the government, policy diffusion and policy learning. Key economic factors included Estonia's very low level of debt prior to the crisis and credit market advantages gained from Eurozone membership.

This paper analyses the diffusion of sustainable development and climate change mitigation policies in rural Austrian municipalities. We scrutinise the policy diffusion rates and patterns. In doing so, we ask whether policy diffusion has induced procedural, political and programmatic effects within the rural government context and, if so, how these changes were accomplished. The results show that the lack of political commitment, political incoherency and insufficient support are major barriers impeding diffusion and implementation. Insufficient programmatic effects are explained by the fact that only "easier" measures have so far been implemented. These "easy" measures stop short of profoundly tackling structural problems or challenging current practices. In contrast to the high expectations regarding the role of municipalities in transitioning towards sustainability and climate-friendly practices, municipalities appear not to have the competencies nor the capacities to implement far-reaching, system-changing measures on their own. © 2021 Oekom Verlag.

But the goals have not been clearly outlined and instead, the array of stated goals varies by jurisdiction, creating obstacles for policy diffusion and comparative analyses across numerous randomized controlled trials. Without clearly defined goals, there is no alignment on what success looks like. This narrative review seeks to uncover why body cameras have been implemented in police agencies and what these agencies expect to gain from their use. It details the range of rationales for the adoption of body cameras, which stakeholder parties benefit from goal attainment, and what outcome measurements researchers have and can use to measure body cameras' ability to reach those goals. Most systematic literature reviews of body camera studies simply focus on one outcome measurement. This paper provides a broad view of the body camera research involving multiple outcome variables. It maps these findings onto the stated goals to demonstrate which goals seem to be attainable and which seem to expect body cameras to be a silver bullet solution to societal problems. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The current theory on CSL diffusion has been developed almost exclusively by studying patterns of adoption in the Western world. This paper tests reasons for diffusion that are prominent in this Western literature and adds additional predictors that are likely to better represent educational governance in Africa. The main finding from this paper is that adoption of seven-year CSLs in Africa can be predicted primarily through common linguistic and historical ties between countries, rather than through other variables that are theorized to be important from prior literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The extent of political fragmentation of metropolitan areas impedes effective land use planning in many countries, and thus contributes to the phenomenon of urban sprawl. For some metropolises in the United States and Europe, strategic interaction between local policymakers codetermines the implementation of local planning policies. However, previous empirical analyses of this phenomenon have usually assumed interdependence in planning decisions to be confined to neighbouring jurisdictions. This is a common simplification in research on diffusion in public policies. Proceeding on the assumption that municipal zoning decisions are subject to competition between municipal authorities trying to attract new residents, I suggest an alternative conceptualisation of location-choice competition in Tiebout-like economies: the correlations of out-commuting patterns serve as a proxy for the degree to which municipalities are competitors for mobile residents, irrespective of their contiguity. Spatial autoregressive models, estimated on the basis of a large panel of fine-grained zoning data, reveal that zoning decisions in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland's most dynamic metropolitan area, are indeed subject to such interdependence. © Cambridge University Press, 2016.},

These properties include contagious, hierarchical, and relocation diffusion. Each of these refers to a spatial model that epitomizes how innovations spread among geographic locations. Policy diffusion, a separate but homologous research tradition, had its theoretical underpinnings in spatial diffusion. However, contemporary policy diffusion has focused largely on mechanism-based diffusion. This article demonstrates how exploratory spatial data analysis can be used to uncover spatial policy diffusion properties. In this study, municipal smoking regulation adoptions, religious-based initiatives, and bag ban and bag fees are examined. This study finds evidence that for each policy more than one property is occurring; therefore, this study proposes that a hybrid model best explains diffusion. This article demonstrates how examining spatial diffusion properties, in addition to diffusion mechanisms, can improve the conceptualization of diffusion theories, enhance mechanism or theory-based specification of diffusion models, and unravel the specific regional or neighboring causal pathways linking policies between adopting jurisdictions. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization},

	abstract = {Representatives of the Dutch government usually refer to the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 as an example of the successful transfer of the Dutch Delta Approach to Bangladesh. Their storyline aligns with theorizations of policy transfer as a process of diffusion. These ascribe the mobility of a policy – or its capacity to travel - to its intrinsic quality. The belief in the quality of the Dutch Delta Approach is anchored in the renowned Dutch ability to deal with its own floods and flood risks. By making the contents of that what travels an important cause of its mobility, diffusion theories make it difficult to see, acknowledge and understand the actions and actors needed to make policy transfer happen. This is why in this paper we theorize policy transfer as a process of translation. Based on an identification of the Dutch and Bangladeshi actors involved in the transfer of the Dutch Delta Approach to Bangladesh, and by re-tracing their actions, we show that the transfer entailed an active process of engagement, negotiation, and contestation. In their attempts to develop a Bangladeshi version of the Plan, the involved actors made active use of old relations of collaboration and friendship, while also developing new ones. In the course of the transfer process, and because of the negotiations and contestations that it entailed, the delta plan became something else altogether. The paper concludes that telling the story of the transfer of the Dutch Delta Approach as a story of translation is useful as it allows recognizing and giving credit not just to those who initiated the process, but to all involved. This, we hope, can in turn provide the basis for a more symmetrical dialogue between ‘senders’ and ‘recipients’ in international policy transfers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Moreover, with an in-depth investigation of plastic bag policies through the lens of diffusion research, the article provides insights in the rather new and still underexplored policy field of plastic pollution. We find that industrialized countries have mostly adopted plastic bag taxes, while developing countries have mainly introduced plastic bag bans and thus more stringent legislation than countries in the Global North. So far, the key driving force for the diffusion of plastic bag policies in the Global North has been the global public pressure. In the Global South, where plastic bag litter is much more visible and harmful due to limited waste collection and recycling rates, national problem pressure has been much more influential. © 2018 by the authors.},

It reviews the status of policy theory and suggests that several guidelines for improving it.

	abstract = {Rising economies face a crucial dilemma when establishing their position on international patent law. Should they translate their increasing economic strength into political power to further developing countries’ interests in lower levels of international patent protection? Or, anticipating a rising domestic interest in stronger international patent protection, should they adopt a position that favours maximal patent protection? Drawing on multiple case studies using a most-similar system design, we argue that rising economies, after having been coerced into adopting more stringent patent standards, tend to display ambivalent positions, trapped in bureaucratic politics and caught between conflicting domestic constituencies. We find that the recent proliferation of international institutions and the expansion of transnational networks have contributed to fragmentation and polarisation in domestic patent politics. As a result, today’s emerging economies experience a more tortuous transformative process than did yesterday’s. This finding is of particular relevance for scholars studying rising powers, as well as for those working on policy diffusion, regulatory regimes, transnational networks and regime complexes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {As Parties to the Paris Agreement struggle to reach agreement on guidance for Article 6, a key question remains: How will jurisdictions develop standards to engage in market cooperation? One recommendation is for interested jurisdictions to form Carbon Market Coalitions to pursue high standards in order to ensure the environmental integrity of market cooperation. This paper examines 8 Emissions Trading Systems (EU, Swiss, New Zealand, RGGI, WCI, Tokyo & Saitama, Kazakhstan, and the Republic of Korea) for patterns in the development of ETS standards over time and among ETS. ETS development in the absence of robust international rules provides a useful comparison for how jurisdictions may develop rules for mar-ket-based cooperation post-2020 if the CMA fails to provide strong guidance. The results of the analysis reveal that ETS jurisdictions respond to pressures to stabilise and improve ETS over time. Globally, there are also observable trends of policy diffusion of beneficial measures and avoidance of past problems and challenges. The paper concludes that jurisdictions pursuing cooperation through carbon coalitions would likely respond to similar stimuli as existing ETS, which would result in the development of standards that would improve over time. © 2019, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

We examine the adoption of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) from 1996 to 2014 to shed light on what motivates states to adopt innovations that are in explicit defiance of federal law. Furthermore, we examine whether federal signals have any influence on the likelihood of adoption. In doing so, we utilize implementation theory to expand our understanding of how the federal government's position impacts state policy innovation adoption. We find mixed evidence for the influence of federal signals on the adoption of MMLs. The results suggest that medical marijuana policies are much more likely to be adopted in states when proponents have the political or institutional capital, rather than a medical or fiscal need. Moreover, this political capital is sufficient independent of the federal government's real or perceived position. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization},

Future work on the relationship between organizational performance and size would likely benefit from including such interaction variables. We also provide evidence that to create a more productive institution, county-level officials learned from their most productive neighbors and adjusted the size of their communes accordingly.

While the drivers of RE policy adoption have been well-studied in the U.S. and Europe, we know little about the factors that drive RE policy adoption in developing countries. Both theory and anecdotal evidence suggest that policies often spread when one country emulates another's policy, but scholars of policy diffusion have tended to focus on emulation of political and ideological peers, overlooking other factors that may be particularly critical for driving RE policy adoption, including emulation of peers with similar electric sector conditions and emulation that is driven by coercive donor-recipient aid relationships. We use a directed dyadic analysis to assess the factors that prompt a country to emulate another's policies and to determine whether emulation patterns differ across developed and developing countries. We find that both sets of countries tend to emulate the policies of their political peers, and that developing countries tend to emulate the policies of donors. The effect of electric sector similarities varies by policy type. Countries emulate feed-in tariffs of countries with similar electric sector conditions, but they emulate quota policies of countries with dissimilar levels of reliance on renewable energy. Results suggest that different policies may diffuse via different emulation patterns. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Uniquely, this convention was the only one to receive near universal ratification, with African countries comprising half of the first 20 to sign the convention. Ghana was first among these countries to ratify the convention. This set off a bandwagon effect of other African countries quickly ratifying the convention. However, a year later, African governments reacted to their low involvement in the drafting process of the UNCRC and also to what they thought to be an inadequate representation of the real experience of the African child in the UNCRC. Consequently, this group adopted their own version of the convention – the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC). However, unlike the experience with the UNCRC, African nations were not quick to ratify their own Charter; the ACRWC is hardly discussed in public and policy forums in Africa, and its use among those charged with the protection of children is minimal. Using the lenses of policy diffusion, I assess the influence of coercion and emulation mechanisms on privileging the UNCRC which is used as the main organizing framework for child rights in most African countries. Additionally, I look at how Ghana’s political reputation influenced other African adopters, an effect which was not replicated with the ratification of the ACRWC. Implications for social work research, policy and practice are discussed. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

The rapid establishment of the urban subsistence allowance system in more than 200 cities throughout the country in seven years (1993-1999) serves as a case for our empirical analysis of the diffusion mechanism of social policy innovations at different levels of government. Our findings show, firstly, that in adopting a new social policy, city governments have to respond to the social desire of local citizens while keeping fiscal constraints in mind; at the same time, they are affected by administrative orders from higher-level governments and the vertical fiscal relations between governments at different levels, and are also subject to competitive pressures from other cities at the same level. Secondly, city governments’ policy innovations offer an opportunity for higher levels of government to learn from their experience. Thirdly, central government orders exert both a direct and indirect influence upon city governments, with provincial orders acting as intermediaries. And lastly, there is a clear difference in the time lag effect of orders from the central government and those at provincial level upon city governments’ policy adoption. © 2018 Social Sciences in China Press.},

In this complex issue area, however, policymakers must invest lot of resources to monitor competitors, evaluate policy alternatives and shepherd tax reform through the legislative process. This implies that highly professional legislatures should be more responsive to the policies of nearby states. We consider data on most American states over the period from 1986 to 2013 and find strong evidence of conditional spatial dependence.

The system was initiated at the highest levels within the government, but the fast-tracked nature of the implementation process did not provide sufficient notification to the donor community to mobilize much-needed technical support until the pilot phase had been completed. Implementation of a fully operational system was postponed until 2018 due to industry mobilization against the system and unresolved legal and technical issues. The findings indicate that the longer-term outcome of a diffusion process can be policy divergence, not convergence, as domestic interest groups influence policy and as governments learn from their own implementation experiences. © 2017 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

We study bills from U.S. state legislatures. We present three ground truth tests, applied to a corpus of 500,000 bills. First, we show that bills introduced by ideologically similar sponsors exhibit a high degree of text reuse, that bills classified by the National Conference of State Legislatures as covering the same policies exhibit a high degree of text reuse, and that rates of text reuse between states correlate with policy diffusion network ties between states. In an empirical application of our similarity measure, we find that Republican state legislators introduce legislation that is more similar to legislation introduced by Republicans in other states, than is legislation introduced by Democratic state legislators to legislation introduced by Democrats in other states. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization},

	abstract = {In 2014, Japan’s Ministry of Education (MEXT) announced the Top Global University Project (TGUP), a large-investment initiative to internationalise higher education that implicitly signalled increased emphasis on English-medium instruction (EMI) at Japanese universities. Despite substantial funding behind the initiative, little research has evaluated the implications for language planning, including contextualised implementation challenges. This study aims to investigate how the policy is being enacted into practice at a university in Japan at two different policy levels: the meso (institutional) and micro (classroom) level. The study contrasts one university’s TGUP meso-level policy documentation with data from semi-structured interviews with students and teachers to illuminate micro-level challenges. Data were coded according to emergent themes via qualitative text analysis, following similar processes to research into TGUP policy. The findings suggest that the meso-level policy goals of the university do not trickle down to micro-level practice as envisioned, revealing underlying challenges arising from policy diffusion. In comparing our results with data from other TGUP university studies, we conclude that micro-level linguistic challenges for teachers and students has relevance for other universities where English-taught programmes are being expanded via national and university-level policies. © 2018, The Author(s).},

However, there is a comparative lack of empirical literature exploring why states adopt different types of tax incentives. This article draws on the literatures on tax competition and policy diffusion to develop hypotheses about what factors motivate states to adopt business tax incentives, paying particular attention to the influence of other adopting states. It uses event history analysis methods to test hypotheses regarding the adoption of four state tax incentive policies: investment tax credits, apportionment formula changes, research and development tax credits, and job creation tax credits. Regression results show that factors that influence adoption decisions are largely inconsistent across the four incentive types. However, analyses of duration dependence find evidence consistent with the idea that states are “racing to the bottom.”. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {Most studies of policy interdependence try to observe international policy networks by focusing on the diffusion of a specific policy across countries. Thus, if that policy is not adopted from one country to the next, researchers usually treat that as a sign of weak interdependence and the lack of diffusion. In this article, we challenge the notion that diffusion processes and interdependence entail the same policy diffusing. National governments usually engage in a bundle of diffusing policies at the same time. We argue that they are often pressed to implement the policy adopted in neighboring countries. But, at the same time, their incentive to implement this policy depends, at least in part, on how much they rely on foreign resources. The greater their dependence, the more likely they are to adopt the policy preferences of foreign constituents. Thus, conditional on a neighbor's pressure to adopt a policy, states may engage in policy alteration-the adoption of an alternative instrument to an internationally diffusing policy. We claim that such policy substitution is especially likely in countries that are less dependent on economic flows, as their governments enjoy more political leeway to turn policy diffusion processes to their advantage. We trace this mechanism using two studies of the diffusion of alternative environmental policies across space and time. © The Author (2017).

Do countries develop similar rules in response to similar challenges? Or is the similarity of laws and policies due to the interdependent responses that scholars have referred to as processes of policy convergence, transfer, and diffusion? We draw on an analysis of immigration and nationality laws of 22 countries throughout the Western Hemisphere from 1790 to 2010, and of seven case studies of national and international policymaking, to show that policies are often interdependent, even in the domain of immigration law, which scholars have presumed to be relatively immune to external influence. We argue that specific mechanisms of diffusion explain the rise of racist immigration policies in the Americas, their subsequent decline, and the rise of an anti-discriminatory norm for policies. Most striking among our findings is that at key junctures after 1940, weaker countries effectively advanced an anti-discriminatory policy agenda against the desires of world powers. We identify the conditions under which weaker countries were able to reach their goals despite opposition from world powers. © 2019 Law and Society Association},

	abstract = {There have been many explanations for why countries ratify global environmental treaties. They range from neorealist theory, to hegemony theory, world society theory, and network embeddedness theory. Drawing on hegemonic transition theory, this paper provides evidence that prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, strong and weak countries ratified a treaty if the USA or the USSR ratified the treaty first. After the fall of the Soviet Union, countries’ proximity to world society institutions increased the likelihood of ratifying a treaty, and only weaker countries emulated the ratifications of the USA and Russia. However, weaker countries also emulated economic, religious, and language peers, diplomatic ties, and neighbors as well. In contrast, more powerful countries ratified treaties more independently. We studied the ratifications of eight universal environmental treaties by 166 countries between 1981 and 2008 and showed that as the geopolitical context changed, the diffusion process changed. The paper argues that the hegemonic transition which took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s was an enabling event that helped to explain the new roles that major powers assumed in the 1990s and 2000s and opened the door to the ascendency of global institutions and broader participation in the environmental regime. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

We theorise that geographical peers will have the largest impact in adoption decisions; that ideological peers are an important source of policy information when states make decisions about reinventing innovations adopted by others; and that internal factors will drive the decision by a state to amend a policy. We test these expectations for renewable portfolio standards in the American states between 1996 and 2009. Results suggest that state policymakers emulate peers in adoption or policy design choices, and that internal influences have a stronger influence on amendment decisions than do external influences.

	abstract = {Today more than ever it is crucial to understand the dynamic and intricate institutional landscape that MNEs operate in. However, the drivers of institutional change are still little understood. We focus on a recent fundamental institutional change: the worldwide switch to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The switch to IFRS was unexpected and not particularly welcomed by MNEs given that most national accounting systems in the pre-IFRS period were considered to be well aligned to the local cultural and environmental characteristics of each country. We test the drivers of this institutional change in a sample of 168 countries between 2002 and 2012 using empirical constructs from policy diffusion theory. Our findings show that the country-level decisions to adopt IFRS are not driven by local determinants but instead by adoption decisions by other, neighbouring countries and influential organizations. We find evidence for competition, learning and emulation as driving forces for the international spread of IFRS. We conclude that the switch to IFRS was not driven by an economic rationale only and diffused beyond the influence and interest of MNEs. Understanding these drivers is essential, because it enables management to anticipate and respond to institutional changes and consequently enhance performance and create competitive advantage. © 2017 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.},

Since its initiation in 2000, it was soon adopted in almost all provinces in China. In the process of transferring developmental rights, what roles do different levels of governments play and why? To answer these questions, this research conducts a policy process analysis by combing the methods of process tracing and multi-level event history analysis. It finds that the policy process of IDB is a bottom-up one. The prefectural level governments are the engine of the whole process for they gain direct benefit from the transfer of developmental right. Provincial governments, on the one hand, act as a hub connecting local to central; on the other hand, fail to regulate and supervise the implementation. Central government is pushed by the force from local to enact the policy of IDB but also shows lukewarm support to it with a concern that it might deviate from the Pareto increase and damaged peasants’ wellbeing. This research explores the complicated inter-governmental relations in land policy-making process in China and also proposes policy implication on IDB's future implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Sustained organizational influence necessitates an institutional focus across a broad range of issues and across a long period of time. Sustaining organizations are well-financed, and exert their influence on legislators through benefits, shared ideological interests, and time-saving opportunities. Sustaining organizations' centralized nature makes legislators' jobs easier by providing legislators with ready-made model legislation. We argue that sustaining organizations uniquely contribute to policy diffusion in the U.S. states. We evaluate this model with a case study of state-level immigration sanctuary policy making and the role that the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) played in disseminating model legislation. Through quantitative text analysis and several negative binomial state-level regression models, we demonstrate that ALEC has exerted an overwhelming influence on the introduction of anti-sanctuary legislative proposals in the U.S. states over the past 7 years consistent with our particular model of network policy diffusion.

By 2015, the value of domestic investment in five central provinces alone was 2.5 times that of foreign investment throughout China. Compared to the original "flying geese" model of tiered production in Asia, China's experience is distinct in three ways: (1) industrial transfer occurred domestically, rather than across nations; (2) sub-national transfer followed cross-national transfer; and (3) industrial migration is accompanied by a delayed replication of government policies and practices. While coastal locales today resolve to expel low-end industries, inland governments cannot afford to be selective and have only recently adopted the aggressive investment promotion tactics that coastal cities abandoned years ago. Policy diffusion is delayed as policy adoption depends on economic conditions, which vary widely across China and change over time. © 2018 SOAS University of London.},

	abstract = {Most accounts of international negotiations suggest that global agreements are individually crafted and distinct, while some emerging scholarship suggests a heavy reliance on models and templates. In this research, we present a comprehensive test of whether new international treaties are heavily copied and pasted from past ones. We specify several reasons to expect widespread copying and pasting, and argue that both the most and least powerful countries should be most likely to do so. Using text analysis to examine several hundred preferential trade agreements (PTAs), we reveal that most PTAs copy a sizable majority of their content word for word from an earlier agreement. At least one hundred PTAs take 80 percent or more of their contents directly from a single, existing treaty-with many copying and pasting 95 percent or more. These numbers climb even higher when we compare important substantive chapters of trade agreements, many of which are copied and pasted verbatim. Such copying and pasting is most prevalent among low-capacity governments that lean heavily on existing templates, and powerful states that desire to spread their preferred rules globally. This widespread replication of existing treaty language reshapes how we think about international cooperation, and it has important implications for literatures on institutional design, policy diffusion, state power, and legal fragmentation. © The Author(s) (2019).

The authors develop and test an integrative theoretical framework drawing from theories on policy diffusion and innovation adoption. Based on this, they investigate how structural, cultural, and environmental variables explain three dimensions of open government: accessibility, transparency, and participation. The framework is tested by combining 2014 survey data and observational data from 500 local U.S. government websites. Organizational structure, including technological and organizational capacity, is a determinant shared by all dimensions of open government. Furthermore, accessibility is affected by a mixture of an innovative and participative culture and external pressures. A flexible and innovative culture positively relates to higher levels of transparency, whereas capacity is a strong predictor of adopting participatory features. The main conclusion is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to fostering the three dimensions of open government, as each dimension is subject to a unique combination of determinants. © 2016 by The American Society for Public Administration},

First, by explicitly focusing on the competition mechanism of diffusion, I consider how policy externalities contribute to free-rider dynamics or competitive races across the American states. The second contribution is the focus on the interdependence of the early stages of agenda setting as well as policy enactments. Using a unique dataset on four different types of tobacco policies that are introduced and eventually enacted in the states from 1990 to 2010, I find evidence that states engage in free-riding dynamics and that strategic interaction exists in the early stages of agenda setting. There is also evidence that states respond to legitimate policy threats in neighboring states. Overall, the results stress the importance of scholars to explore the conditional nature of policy diffusion dynamics by focusing on variations in policy content and stages of the policymaking process other than policy enactment. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

This paper uses data for more than 260,000 individuals in 34 European countries, 2002–2013, to study how nations’ geographic, cultural, institutional, and economic proximity affect cross-national differences in environment-related attitudes. Borrowing from the literature on international policy diffusion, we hypothesize that citizens have more similar environmental attitudes if their countries are more proximate along those dimensions. Controlling for countries’ demographic, economic, and environmental characteristics, we find that countries that are more proximate in terms of geography, common culture and institutions, and intensity of trade relations have more similar environmental attitudes. Though we find a general cross-national divergence of environmental attitudes over the period considered, cultural and institutional proximity attenuate or reverse this trend. The significant role of proximity and connectedness suggests that the prospects for international coordination of environmental policies are most favorable within sufficiently integrated sets of countries. © 2017, AESS.},

Specifically, we argue that governments regulate lobbying when they face the combination of low to moderate levels of corruption and a relatively well-developed economy. To assess this argument empirically, we compare 42 developed countries between 2000 and 2015, using multivariate logistic regressions and two illustrative case studies. The statistical analysis supports our argument, even if we include a number of control variables, such as the presence of a second parliamentary chamber, the age of democracy, and a spatial lag.

	abstract = {In an increasingly globalised world, today's international challenges such as climate change transcend national boundaries and require multi-level governance responses. Cities, in particular, stand out as an essential governing unit with huge potentials in resolving some of the 21st century's most pressing concerns. The recent explosion of the phenomenon of city-networks reflects intensifying city-to-city interactions in addressing global environmental issues. This article examines the case of Tokyo in addressing challenges posed by climate change. Examining the origin, development, and diffusion of Tokyo's climate change policy, the cap-and-trade scheme was found to have first diffused from Europe to Tokyo, adjusted to adapt to the local context, then further diffused to other Asian cities. Study of Tokyo's experience demonstrates that policy formation does not always follow a centralized, top-down, command-and-control approach. This findings challenge conventional realist conception which emphasises the dominance of central authorities and sovereign states in global policy formation. Under the framework of global governance, this article argues that cities are important sites of policy experimentation and innovation, and that the case of Tokyo demonstrates the potential of cross-country policy diffusion. © 2019 Nikita Chiu, published by Sciendo 2019.},

This phenomenon has been studied in political science as policy diffusion and policy transfer, and in geography and other critical social sciences as policy mobility. While these different research agendas have many similarities, one key difference is their treatment of space. The political science literature tends to fall into the ‘territorial trap’, while the policy mobility literature, for the most part, avoids it by focusing on policy-making contexts across and between jurisdictions. But even here, territory is generally opposed to relationality in understanding policy change. By incorporating recent work outlining the linkages between relational and territorial space, we can bring a more dynamic conception of territory into the study of policy mobility, with implications for its aims and methodologies. © Sami Moisio, Natalie Koch, Andrew E.G.

	abstract = {This study examines why a large number of Western advanced economies joined the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2015 despite the bank's purported challenge to the Western-centred international order in the area of multilateral development finance. Through a mixed-method examination involving elite interviews, analyses of government pronouncements and regressions, and by drawing on concepts from rational choice theory, international policy diffusion, and rational design of international institutions, this study finds that the AIIB's success with regard to its large membership is due to China's effective creation of a demand for the organization among Western advanced economies. We argue that policymakers in Western countries enjoyed 'induced agency', which China granted them in the process of creating the organization and deciding about its membership. First, Western advanced economies had agency because their involvement was needed to prevent the AIIB from becoming a homogenous small organization consisting of Asian debtor countries in favour of a global organization with a heterogeneous group of both debtor and creditor country members. The AIIB was thus set up to accommodate the specific economic and political goals of Western advanced economies. Secondly, Western advanced economies experienced agency in the process of deciding about their membership in the bank because China proactively courted them to join the AIIB. China moreover endorsed the spontaneous intensification of communications that ensued among Western advanced economies with regard to joining the AIIB. Both efforts ultimately resulted in diffusion among them of the decision to become members. Thirdly, the Western advanced economies were granted agency in the process of determining the AIIB's organizational design, thus allowing them to converge the initially diverse visions for the institutional design of the bank and shift it from contesting the existing system of multilateral development banks to effectively integrating into it. Our study thus advances a theory of country-specific demand for membership in an international organization. © The Author(s) 2019.

Building upon the existing literature, this study seeks to explain the introduction of lobbying laws in EU and OECD member states from 1995 to 2014. The analysis considers variables related to the presence of lobbying scandals, the external promotion by international organizations and corporatism. The causal mechanisms follow the theoretical arguments developed in the literature on political agenda-setting effects, policy diffusion and theories of interest representation. The empirical investigation is based on an original dataset and a statistical investigation using event history analysis and multinomial regression models. The results suggest that policy diffusion variables influence the likelihood of passing lobbying laws. While scandals only affect the presentation of proposals for lobbying regulation in Parliament, corporatism shows no effects on the passage of such laws. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

In this article, I seek to reintroduce a seminal contribution of the early institutionalists by challenging the assumption that dimensions of adoption and implementation are synonymous or positively correlated.

Policy diffusion means that policies in one unit (country, state, city, etc.) are influenced by the policies of other units. The diffusion literature conceptualises these interdependencies with four mechanisms: learning, competition, coercion and emulation. The article identifies a model of diffusion that is dominant in the diffusion literature. According to this model, policies spread because decision makers evaluate the policy implications of the actions of other units. It is argued that the role of politics remains in the background in this model, and the article shows how going beyond a narrow focus on policy adoptions helps us to consider the politics of policy diffusion more explicitly. © 2019 European Consortium for Political Research},

At the same time, interoperability and quality standards are conducive to market competition by enabling freedom of choice for users. On the other hand, telecoms and ICT technologies cannot be understood without the occurrence of network effects. In this light, the paper posits that regulatory and policy diffusion actually represent an externality of the EU Internal Market building process, complemented by a meaningful involvement of the EU in global standard-setting activities. While international standard-setting activities are largely dominated by non-state and private actors, the paper assesses how the EU manages regulatory and policy export through standardization. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {Worldwide, 892 million people practice open defecation, most of whom live in rural areas of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is the most widely deployed approach to generate demand for, and use of sanitation facilities. CLTS relies on behavioral change and community self-enforcement to end open defecation. Since its genesis in Bangladesh in 1999, CLTS has spread to approximately 60 countries, mostly in Asia and Africa, and is employed by the majority of development organizations operating in rural sanitation. This paper uses a qualitative approach to analyze the reasons and processes that drove the wide diffusion of CLTS. We show that CLTS was embraced because it was perceived as a fast and effective solution to the problem of open defecation, one which was in line with the decentralization and community participation paradigms, at a time when donors and governments were looking for strategies to meet the MDG for sanitation. CLTS spread under the leadership of influential donors, NGOs, persuasive practitioners, and academics. Face-to-face interactions among members of this network and local governments at conferences and workshops played a central role in the diffusion of the approach. The use of experiential learning during study tours and workshop field visits has been crucial to persuade government actors at different levels, NGOs, and donors to use the CLTS approach. Notably, robust scientific evidence played little role in the diffusion of CLTS. We conclude by making suggestions to strengthen the evidence base for rural sanitation policies. © 2019},

The results demonstrate that leadership transfer networks channel performance innovation between locations where managers served/serve, especially when the institutional environments are similar between the locations.

While these states have made relatively limited use of static content censorship, alternative, less overt controls have spread across the region.

Fully institutionalized democracies adopted the policy first because the core features of inflation targeting are consistent with the principles of a liberal democracy. But why was inflation targeting also introduced by less-democratic countries? This article develops the argument that decision makers of less-democratic countries became more likely to adopt inflation targeting when they observed that nearby countries increased the flexibility of the policy. The statistical analysis of data from 76 countries between 1989 and 2013 supports this hypothesis. The finding that the change of a policy toward a more flexible framework drives its global spread addresses a blind spot in the more recent policy diffusion literature. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The American states are prolific energy policymakers. Over the past two decades, they have adopted a variety of policies aimed at technology innovation and carbon reductions. These policy decisions, however, are not made within a vacuum. States share peer relationships through which they exchange policy relevant information. Research on energy policy has recognized the existence of these networks, but measured them only indirectly, typically with a measure of geographic proximity. This approach likely provides an incomplete picture of the ways in which states share information in this important domain. Based on a pilot survey of expert informants in state energy policy, in this Perspectives article we show that policy information networks extend beyond geographic proximity. Our results reveal that measures used in studies of energy policy diffusion are overly simplistic, underestimate the importance of states sharing information, and fail to capture the actual reasons states look to one another. We argue that it is important to account for these alternative channels in future policy diffusion scholarship. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Based on their official self-assessment reports, this study investigates the progress of 32 pilot sites from the initial two batches. Indicators of progress include: establishing a comprehensive governance system to guarantee the implementation of low-carbon strategies, plans and actions; implementing a carbon emission statistics system; carrying out low-carbon actions covering the majority of emission sectors and having produced positive consequences for local low-carbon development; exploring new policies and institutions including legislation, emissions control, carbon certification and green credit schemes, that lead to the formulation of national policies. Despite some defects in the experiments, the progress from these pilot sites has laid an important foundation for the advancement of national low-carbon development. Based on this analysis, this study provides recommendations for policy diffusion: to integrate more constraints and incentives into low-carbon pilot sites; to establish a policy assessment system to identify effective local experiments; and to summarize and share these best practices across the country. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The experimental evidence shows that local officials do not exhibit this bias. Further, they do not exhibit a bias against information about policies that have received an EU endorsement.

We argue that emulation and competition have led to the process of policy diffusion between these two countries. The competition between these two foreign aid leaders in East Asia especially after China's Belt and Road Initiative has shaped the region's infrastructure development dynamics as they strive to move the equilibrium outcome to their advantage.

It argues that existing studies on the subject do not provide an adequate understanding of the mechanisms through which diffusion takes place, nor do they sufficiently address the roles specific organizations and individuals play in driving or determining the policy transfer process. We address these shortcomings by studying the diffusion of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes from Latin America to Ghana and the Philippines over the past decade. We use the concept of ‘instruments constituency’ to delineate and trace the various actors and channels involved in the diffusion of CCTs. The comparative case studies show that these constituencies, dedicated to the articulation, adoption, and expansion of particular policy instruments, are central players in transnational diffusion of policies. This finding has significant implications for the study of policy transfer and diffusion, identifying a heretofore neglected actor in these processes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This article examines the key drivers behind China’s 2011 decision to opt for ETS as a GHG mitigating policy tool and what lay behind the choice of the system’s design features. Given the existence of the frontrunner EU ETS and that market mechanisms have spread across the world in recent years, we analyze the role played by policy diffusion in the decision to launch an ETS and in the subsequent design process, seen in relation to domestic drivers. The article investigates policy developments culminating in the 2011 carbon market announcement, and the reasons these design elements were chosen for the pilot schemes and the national market in the period 2011–2017. The article contributes to our understanding of policy diffusion at different stages of policy development in China, by revealing which diffusion mechanism is more prevalent at different stages. We find first that overall domestic conditions and drivers had the most consistent impact on policy decisions to establish a carbon market and on the selected sectors. However, a second key finding is that the role of policy diffusion varied over time, with such diffusion, in the form of ideational impact, playing the most important role early on, providing a powerful inducement for China to go for a carbon market. Third, sophisticated learning from international projects took place in the pilots, allowing China to adapt policies and design features to match local conditions. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization},

This significant literature does not pay adequate attention to the importance of the EU agencies’ behaviour as actors in policy promotion beyond the EU. Based on organization theory, this chapter aims to fill this gap and suggests that the EU agencies acquire organizational structural characteristics that enhance their role in the international arena with respect to the diffusion of policy ideas, principles, practices and policy models. The EU agencies develop their own capacity, interests and strategies; organize international arrangements; and become actors with the intention to diffuse policy ideas and standards beyond the EU. They do so through mechanisms of socialization, persuasion and learning. In order to operationalize this, the chapter investigates three decentralized agencies _ the European Environmental Agency, the European Medicines Agency and the European Food Safety Authority _ whose activities concentrate on the environment, health and food safety respectively. These agencies share a common interest in environmental and health quality within their risk assessment mandate. Variations in their organizational structural characteristics lead to differences in their behaviour and arrangements in the international arena. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2019 All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We study the dynamics of policy diffusion when a first-moving jurisdiction that legalizes an activity reduces the probability of legalization in nearby later-acting jurisdictions. If a jurisdiction's firms can sell to neighboring residents, but if the good is competitively sold at every location, then policies converge: all jurisdictions legalize or all jurisdictions ban. If firms have some market power, and if the location of firms depends on the order of legalization, an early-adopting government may legalize, but an otherwise identical, but later-acting, neighboring government might not. This possible asymmetry is due to state dependence resulting from the initial distribution of firms following the first-mover's legalization. Empirically, counties that legalize the sale of fireworks first have more firework vendors just inside their border than counties that legalize later. Furthermore, counties have a longer duration to legalize fireworks if nearby counties have already adopted. State dependence resulting from a first-mover advantage contributes to the policy divergence of regulatory policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

We ask how city councils learn about the negative consequences of laws by evaluating the policy diffusion and decision-theoretic learning hypotheses using a case study of criminal activity nuisance ordinance repeals in several cities within one county. These laws as originally written designated properties as “nuisances” if emergency services were called too frequently, including in cases of domestic violence. The seven case cities repealed their laws so survivors of domestic violence would not risk a fine or eviction because they called for help. We argue neither theory is sufficient to explain the repeal of these laws and instead suggest a new variant of policy learning, the entrepreneur catalyzed learning hypothesis, to highlight the importance of policy entrepreneurs in facilitating policy learning and the repeal of unsuccessful laws at the city level. © The Author(s) 2019.},

But when Brazil decided to join the network of investment agreements, it did so on its own terms, employing a model agreement that significantly departs from the globally-disseminated BIT-format.

	abstract = {Transnational policy transfer is a well-documented phenomenon with studies from across many disciplines. However, the literature tends to over-theorize but under-operationalize what is transferred and how it is transferred. A significant issue in this regard concerns ‘agency’: that is, who is supplying and who is demanding policy lessons and examples. This paper highlights a relatively new concept in comparative policy studies, that of the ‘instrument constituency’, within the framework of transnational policymaking. It argues that instrument constituencies or groups of actors unified by their strong affinity with a specific policy tool are key agents in the transfer process, acting as suppliers and brokers of policy ideas, constantly searching to match their preferred solutions to policy problems. As this paper will show, incorporating such constituencies into policy transfer studies allows a better understanding of transfer as part of a sequential process of diffusion, and how knowledge about a policy instrument is assembled and transferred. © 2019 The Authors.

Soft direct democracy refers to non-binding referendum motions and advisory referendums, which the literature on direct democracy has largely ignored. Strategic motives have dominated previous explanations of the occurrence of initiatives and referendums, but are less useful in exploring non-binding procedures of direct democracy. The article distinguishes four types of factors – socio-structural, party system, political support and learning – and tests hypotheses on their effects with sub-national data from Finland. The data enable us to compare two different types of instruments – non-binding referendum motions and advisory referendums – while controlling for many unobserved factors. The findings show that erosion of political support, participatory traditions and policy diffusion explain the occurrence of bottom-up referendum motions, while the last two together with small population and party system factors predict the occurrence of advisory government-initiated referendums. © 2017 Swiss Political Science Association},

Considering that African countries are not official signatories but are aligning their systems of education to the BP, and in the absence of a coordinated effort and the use of digital technology to produce and present data that documents and maps out progress, tracing the diffusion process in this context is challenging, which is the reason for limited research in this area. Based on a review of existing literature, this article argues that in Africa, the dissemination and transfer of BP-related reforms started as individual projects by national governments as early as 2000 before metamorphosing into sub-regional and regional initiatives. The article identifies economic, political and discursive factors as well as the selective and silent processes that shaped Bologna transfer at these different levels in Africa. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Local immigration policies are embedded in broader processes that encompass, cut across and link multiple localities. The relational approach is especially designed to account for such processes, combining relational arguments of previous studies with contributions from anthropology, human geography, sociology and public policy theory. Following a transactional ontology, this approach conceives the locality as an open site for processes of regional, national and transnational scope. Through these processes, the locality and its policies are formed in relation to dynamics at work on other levels and in other places. This ontology can be operationalized through the concept of policy network, theories of policy diffusion, and the concept of city scale. Methodologically, this ontology can be operationalized through extended case studies, encompassing comparisons, and incorporated comparisons. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The requirement of bottom-up action from all the countries to deal with climate change makes it necessary to analyze the factors influencing policy adoption. This article contributes to the policy literature by shedding light on the conditions, which incentivize countries to adopt more climate mitigation policies. The theoretical argument builds on the integrated approaches to study policy diffusion, which include both internal and external determinants as explanations for the adoption of policies. While previous applications typically operationalize the latter by regional proximity, this study highlights the added value of network dependencies capturing political and cooperative interactions across countries. The article finds that the adoption of climate policies is a matter of social influence. Countries are more likely to adopt policies if they cooperate with countries that have adopted more climate policies and are in a similar structural position to countries that are active in climate protection. This article not only is an important theoretical contribution to the policy literature but also enriches our methodological and empirical understanding of climate policy diffusion. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {International trade transactions come with a peculiar hazard: unlike commerce inside national borders, there are no common courts or legal jurisdictions to enforce contracts should disputes arise. Distance, language, and cultural disparities further complicate contract enforcement for international trade. A 1958 United Nations treaty, the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (NYC), addresses this enforcement gap. NYC signatory countries commit to enforce the outcomes of private arbitration between importers and exporters. This commitment makes private international arbitration a viable legal alternative for dispute resolution, supported by state enforcement through national courts. This paper explores why many countries waited decades to join the NYC despite the obvious benefits. The puzzle is framed with a model of policy adoption – how the net benefits of membership, driven by trade interactions, social contagion or peer effects and internal barriers, influence the timing of membership decisions. In the data, countries are more likely to join when their regional trade partners do. The nature of traded goods is also a strong predictor of NYC membership, as countries that specialize in contract-intensive goods join sooner on average, relative to producers of undifferentiated commodities. © 2019, Academy of International Business.},

Previous studies suggest that partisanship may influence the willingness of public officials to learn from the experience of their peers. Officials’ willingness to consider policies endorsed by copartisans can arise either because party labels are used as informational cues or simply due to copartisan imitation. In the latter case, knowing more about the policy trade-offs should have no effects on politicians’ preferences. Based on two experiments with local public officials where both the party endorsing a policy and the type of information provided were manipulated, we find consistent partisan bias. When a policy is endorsed by copartisans, public officials are more likely to consider pursuing it, and additional policy information does not mitigate this bias. Exploratory analyses of the information-seeking behavior of officials suggest that the partisan bias is not due to differential exposure or attention to policy trade-offs. © 2018 University of Utah.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine challenges multinational companies face during the diffusion of their information security policies. Parent companies use these policies as their discourse for legitimization of their practices in subsidiaries, which leads to value conflicts in subsidiaries. The authors postulate that, when properly crafted, information security policies can also be used to reduce the very conflicts they are creating. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed framework is conceptualized based on the review of literatures on multinational companies, information security policies and value conflict. Findings: The authors identified three factors that may lead to value conflict in subsidiary companies: cultural distance, institutional distance and stickiness of knowledge. They offer three recommendations based on organizational discourse, ambidexterity and resource allocation to reduce value conflict. Research limitations/implications: The authors postulate that information security policies are the sources of value conflict in subsidiary companies. Yet, when crafted properly, these policies can also offer solutions to minimize value conflict. Practical implications: The proposed framework can be used to increase policy diffusion success, minimize value conflict and, in turn, decrease information security risk. Originality/value: The growing literature on information security policy literature is yet to examine the diffusion of policies within multinational companies. The authors argue that information security policies are the source of, and solution to, value conflict in multinational companies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Similarly, critics of PBF have concentrated more on its inability to transform structural indicators of the health system positively and sustainably. So far, the scientific literature has not sufficiently explored the implications concerning the ideological and operational mutations that the PBF is operating. This study investigates these aspects of PBF in conception and operationalization of public health intervention.The concept of depoliticization of public health action is proposed in this analysis to describe the capacity of the PBF to redraw health policy from the realm of political and State intervention, and from the primacy of public sector to field of market-based competition between Government sponsored and non-State actors. © 2018 Universidade Federal de Goias.

This paper examines the factors that lead U.S. state governments to develop comprehensive adaptation plans. Using an event history analysis, we find that a state is more likely to engage in adaptation planning we find that a state is more likely to engage in adaptation planning when it experienced more extreme weather events recently, has more economic activities in coastal regions, or when it has high levels of incomes and civic engagement. We also show that political ideology plays a critical role in subnational adaptation decision making. A state is less likely to pursue adaptation planning when it has a Republican governor or has a lack of preference for environmental legislations. In addition to the internal characteristics, our study further provides evidence of the external influence from other nearby adapting states through spatial policy diffusion. These findings shed light on the motivation for and obstacles to a state's adoption of adaptation policy and also provide implications for environmental federalism. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

Using a novel dataset on charter, voucher, and performance pay policies spanning 1992–2013, I find evidence that strength of the teachers' unions decreases the likelihood of performance pay and that additional strength is less impactful with more Democratic control of the legislature. Teachers' unions are weakly related to a lack of charter laws and do not impact voucher laws. The latter two policies are more strongly associated with policymaker learning and education reform advocacy groups, respectively. These findings suggest that vested interests most strongly impact the policies that most fundamentally threaten their organizational strength and that this effect is conditioned on the party in power; increases in interest group strength are not necessary when policymakers are already sympathetic. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization},

	abstract = {Since the 1990s, 13 of the 15 states of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) have passed asylum policy reforms. Yet, while some of the reforms have resulted in an alignment with European asylum policies, others have not. To account for the scope and content of asylum policy reform in the ENP states, a wide array of possible explanatory factors has been advanced in the literature. However, current explanations remain on a case-specific level, and thus fall short of accounting for the broader variation in asylum policy reform in the EU's neighbourhood. This article seeks to identify the relevant drivers of alignment with European asylum policies, employing a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) across 13 ENP countries. The results show that ENP states align with European asylum policies in two cases: first, if they are electoral democracies and face moderate migratory pressures; second, if they are electoral democracies and hold EU membership aspirations. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Using interviews with key policy actors and a comparative analysis of United States and European policy contexts, this study identifies and describes causal mechanisms through which newly emerging offshore wind energy policies diffused across governmental borders. In so doing, this article demonstrates a new approach to understanding policy learning and diffusion to complement the large-N, quantitative analyses that form the bedrock of the literature. The findings support the argument that future studies must account for policy diffusion between subnational and foreign national governments, as well as diffusion between coequal administrative agencies in different policy subsystems—“directions” of diffusion that are invisible to traditional methods, yet likely to become increasingly common in the face of climate change and other wicked problems. © 2018 Policy Studies Organization},

	abstract = {One of the most important developments over the past three decades has been the spread of liberal economic ideas and policies throughout the world. These policies have affected the lives of millions of people, yet our most sophisticated political economy models do not adequately capture influences on these policy choices. Evidence suggests that the adoption of liberal economic practices is highly clustered both temporally and spatially. We hypothesize that this clustering might be due to processes of policy diffusion. We think of diffusion as resulting from one of two broad sets of forces: one in which mounting adoptions of a policy alter the benefits of adopting for others and another in which adoptions provide policy relevant information about the benefits of adopting. We develop arguments within these broad classes of mechanisms, construct appropriate measures of the relevant concepts, and test their effects on liberalization and restriction of the current account, the capital account, and the exchange rate regime. Our findings suggest that domestic models of foreign economic policy making are insufficient. The evidence shows that policy transitions are influenced by international economic competition as well as the policies of a country’s sociocultural peers. We interpret the latter influence as a form of channeled learning reflecting governments’ search for appropriate models for economic policy. © John J. Kirton 2009.},

	abstract = {There has been growing interest in the diffusion of policy innovations across countries. Research on policy diffusion is characterised by coherent explanatory models that assess the importance of diffusion mechanisms. This study takes a different perspective on diffusion studies and advances public policy literature by introducing the concept of “diffusion entrepreneurs”. These entrepreneurs represent (groups of) individuals, networks, and organisations promoting a certain policy innovation with a view to gain influence. First, drawing from the diffusion literature and linking it to studies investigating policy diffusion in polycentric contexts, we introduce analytical categories to study diffusion entrepreneurs’ key features and actions. Second, to illustrate the analytical value of the concept, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the literature on the diffusion entrepreneurs of health performance-based financing (PBF) in Sub-Saharan Africa. We show how and why this recently diffused policy innovation provides a unique case for demonstrating our conceptual notion: in PBF, a nexus of strongly dedicated diffusion entrepreneurs have strived to induce policy diffusion. Specifically, we explore how the features of PBF diffusion entrepreneurs and their actions affect the outcomes of diffusion processes. Lastly, we reflect on the relevance of our conceptual propositions and offer practical insights to guide future investigations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

But in other federal and multi-level governance systems, the ability of multiple governments to test a variety of policy responses has been lauded as an effective way to build local and national policy. Despite high-profile examples of policy diffusion in Canada, there has been surprisingly little academic study of policy learning and diffusion among provinces. Featuring cutting-edge research, Provincial Policy Laboratories explores the cross-jurisdictional movement of policies among governments in Canada's federal system. The book comprises case studies from a range of emerging policy areas, including parentage rights, hydraulic fracturing regulations, species at risk legislation, sales and aviation taxation, and marijuana regulation. Throughout, the contributors aim to increase knowledge about this understudied aspect of Canadian federalism and contribute to the practice of intergovernmental policymaking across the country. © University of Toronto Press 2021.

In particular, we examined the roles that intermediaries play in state-level college completion policy diffusion. Data are from 3 states and include observations of policy events, documents, and interviews with 56 participants, including state policy actors and intermediary representatives. This analysis, grounded in conceptual models of policy diffusion, revealed that diffusion occurs at various stages of the policy process, not just adoption. The study also demonstrated the coercive roles that intermediaries can play in promoting policies and revealed how intermediaries facilitate, and sometimes limit, policy learning, which is one of the primary mechanisms by which policies diffuse. By focusing on an underexplored conceptual model of policy diffusion, the national interaction model, this analysis shed light on the role played by intermediaries in state-level college completion policymaking. ©, © The Ohio State University.},

This study combines quantitative event history analysis and qualitative interview methods to try to understand why states adopted film incentive programs and how they were influenced by the adoption of incentives in other states. The analysis suggests that the diffusion processes in state adoptions of film incentives can be largely explained by two factors: (a) the size and sophistication of the existing film industry in the state and (b) a competitive “bandwagon” effect based on the total number of states that had already adopted film incentives. The results emphasize the need to broaden the ways that competitive influences can be conceptualized and modeled in policy diffusion research, especially in economic development. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

Our qualitative study demonstrates that the diffusion of PB in Estonia has so far been driven by the interaction of two mechanisms: learning and imitation.

In order to determine the relative prognostic importance of the various factors predisposing to vaccination decision-making of individual and analyze diffusion of innovation in immunization policy adoption on overall social network architecture, this paper carries out an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach to construct a pandemic immunization simulation model for providing insights into immunization behavior modification of individual during social interaction in community. Simulation results give decision support to assess the relative impact of healthcare services for pandemic control and suggest that reasonable immunization policies tend to promote individual immunization behavior. Moreover, propagation path of immunization awareness inside the community can be reviewed in depth in the simulation result. © 2016 IEEE.},

Today the circulation of policy and knowledge has become more dense and complex. The articles in the special issue concentrate on the growing velocity of policy innovations spreading from the developing world to other parts of the developing as well as into developed countries and towards international organisations. The context of international development cooperation has been particularly fertile in the cross-pollination of ideas, models and policy experiments, and the articles in this Special Issue draw deeply on this insight. Using a ‘development lens’ enables the authors to view processes of knowledge diffusion and policy transfer not from the centre, in the ministries of national governments, but from policy perimeters, in cities and local government, among those outside political power in opposition groups and movements, and bottom-up from policy implementers. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

First, policy learning can also lead to more comprehensive adoption of successful policies. Second, the effect of policy learning on policy comprehensiveness is conditional on lobbying by interest groups, an alternative source of information about policy success. To test these hypotheses, we conduct a directed dyad-year analysis using a dataset on American state drunk driving regulations from 1983 to 2000. The results show that more comprehensive policy adoption by states is positively related to policy success in other states when lobbying by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is relatively low. Moreover, lobbying by MADD increases policy comprehensiveness when policy success is relatively low. This study advances the literature by examining the conditional effects of lobbying on the relationship between policy learning and policy reinvention.  © 2018 Cambridge University Press.},

In this paper we use the case of public bicycle programs (PBPs) in China to examine the effect of intercity learning, specifically site visits, on policy diffusion. Hangzhou’s PBP is regarded as one of the most successful models and many city officials visit and learn from its best practices. We find that adjacent cities characterized by similar attributes are more inclined to learn from Hangzhou’ PBP, which facilitate these cities to adopt PBPs. More frequent site visits attended by more delegates and for more days are more likely to elicit policy adoption, while the leaders’ rank of delegations does not matter. Leadership turnover, prudent decision-making (e.g., incompatibility of PBP), and alternative solutions (e.g., metro) are found to be the missing links in transforming policy learning into policy adoption. We document the process of policy learning and diffusion, which deepens our understanding of the process of local government innovation in China. © 2017, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.},

This article assesses this convergence by testing the propositions of policy diffusion theories and arguing that the explanations of the recent privatization wave need to incorporate the interaction between diffusion mechanisms and domestic factors. Through a paired comparison between Chile and Argentina, the study shows that the combination of external pressures with domestic support from the government and an absence of domestic contestation were crucial for global privatization ideas to be fully adopted in Chile, while in Argentina the absence of domestic factors accounted for a partial policy emulation. The article concludes that although coercive, mimetic and normative diffusion constrained policymakers’ choices, domestic interests produced a variety of responses to these pressures. © 2016 The Editor, Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis: Research and Practice.},

	abstract = {Latin American countries have for a long time been importers of public policies and institutions from the Global North. The colonial legacy and resulting patterns of international relations during the 20th century favoured a course of adoption and hybridization of political institutions. In recent decades, a new conjuncture has emerged in which Latin American policies have started to diffuse South-South and even South-North. Led by Brazil with Participatory Budgeting and the Bolsa Familia program, other countries in the region soon followed. The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and bicycle policies in Curitiba and Bogotá have also reached wide international recognition and circulation. And yet, despite Latin America's new role as a policy "exporter", little is known about its dynamics, causes, and effects. Why have Latin American policies been diffused inside and outside the region? Which actors are involved? What driving forces affect these processes? This innovative collection offers a new perspective on the policy diffusion phenomena. Drawing on different examples from Latin American experiences in urban local policies and national social policies, experts present a new framework to study this phenomenon centered on the mobilization of ideas, interests and discourses for policy diffusion. Latin America and Policy Diffusion will be of great interest to researchers, educators, advanced students and practitioners working in the fields of political science, public policy, international relations and Latin American Studies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

We illustrate the data set’s usefulness by assessing the question of why countries include environmental provisions in trade agreements. Are trade negotiations opportunities to promote stringent environmental standards? Or are environmental provisions window dressing covering protectionist interests? We find evidence that democracies, countries that face import competition, and countries that care about the environment are more likely to include environmental provisions in trade agreements.

Uncertain about how well the new policy will perform, policymakers learn to rely on competing interest groups for information or, under certain circumstances, look to other political jurisdictions for cues on how their policies ought to be further refined. We test our predictions by studying changes in state charter school laws from 1996 to 2014.

Leaning on the policy diffusion literature, this article argues that the more voters support deeper European integration, the more likely cantonal governments are to restrict tobacco advertising. Policymakers use voters' support for more European integration as a signal that they support regulatory policies that are strongly associated with the European Union (EU) in the political and media debate, such as tobacco advertisement bans. This effect ought to be especially strong in the absence of adverse economic interests, such as the presence of the tobacco industry. To buttress these claims, the present article uses statistical analysis, specifically event-history analysis.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes the changes in Singapore’s policy context from 1959 to 2016, analyses the five factors responsible for its success and concludes with advice for policy makers interested in implementing Singapore-style reforms to solve similar problems in their countries. Findings: Singapore’s success can be attributed to these five factors: the pragmatic leadership of the late Lee Kuan Yew and his successors; an effective public bureaucracy; effective control of corruption; reliance on the “best and brightest” citizens through investment in education and competitive compensation; and learning from other countries. Originality/value: This paper will be useful to those scholars and policy makers interested in learning from Singapore’s success in solving its problems. © 2018, Jon S.T. Quah.},

Failing to account for such interdependence risks an incomplete understanding of the choices made by these actors and agencies. As such, we show how researchers analyzing cross-sectional or time-series-cross-sectional (TSCS) data can utilize spatial econometric methods to improve inference on existing questions and, more interestingly, engage a new set of theoretical questions. Specifically, we articulate several general mechanisms for spatial dependence that are likely to appear in research on public administration (isomorphism, competition, benchmarking, and common exposure). We then demonstrate how these mechanisms can be tested using spatial econometric models in two applications: first, a cross-sectional study of district-level bilingual education spending and, second, a TSCS analysis on state-level healthcare administration. In our presentation, we also briefly discuss many of the practical challenges confronted in estimating spatial models (e.g., weights specification, model selection, effects calculation) and offer some guidance on each. © 2019 The Author(s).},

Prior studies of local sales taxes still leave a gap in the literature and render the results inconclusive because the studies cover either state level or localities within a single state for a short period. To cover the gap, we assemble a dataset of counties in all states for FY1970-2006 but focus on 12 states not threatened by intra-jurisdictional competition. Our empirical analyses yield evidence that a county adopts local sales tax for political and economic rationale rather than fiscal condition. Accordingly, regional diffusion has positive effects on local sales tax adoption in a county. These findings contribute substantively to sales tax literature while confirming policy diffusion. © 2017, Copyright © 2017 by PrAcademics Press.},

The spread of medical marijuana offers the opportunity to take a closer look at whether policy and political learning occur during diffusion. An increasing number of states have adopted medical marijuana policies in defiance of federal prohibition and in the space created by federal inactivity. Furthermore, early adopting states have adapted their programs to account for changes in the industry and to coincide with recreational marijuana programs. This article sheds light on how the laws have evolved over time due to policy learning, political learning, and local adaptation. Specifically, we review how states have incorporated best practices from others (policy learning) and how the laws have been repackaged in more politically conservative states (political learning). Finally, we show how states adapt to medical marijuana laws by using precedents from the regulation of other industries. © The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {While studies of policy diffusion and policy transfer have focused largely on industrialized countries, it is the exact opposite when it comes to pension policies where the focus remains on national elements such as institutions and partisanship. Focusing on a case with a high degree of programmatic similarities, this contribution fills this gap by analyzing the adoptive process in an industrialized country. The empirical analysis involves the transfer and diffusion of the Swedish pension reform in Norway. Norway has a long history of borrowing from Sweden. Following a highly publicized Swedish pension reform embraced by the World Bank, Norwegian policy makers could have easily introduced this reform at home when they embarked into a reform process in the early 2000s. By analyzing core policy instruments of the Swedish pension reform and the agenda-setting and the formulation stages in the policy process in the Norwegian case, this contribution explains why it proves complex and difficult to attribute the outcome of a reform to a diffuser and it argues that more attention is needed on the process behind the adoption of policies from abroad. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Given the diverging economic, political and social composition of the countries of the region the near simultaneous introduction of the rights-based cash transfer programmes might be attributed to regional policy diffusion, caused either by some common pressures, learning from neighbours, or emulation. Using the case of employment guarantee programmes we contribute to the diffusion literature by showing that the schemes were not copied fully, but adapted to the national social, political and financial circumstances of the countries, built on the respective programme predecessors or not copied at all. Governments in the region were able to choose not only the timing of introduction but also the scope, coverage and generosity as well as their regulatory framework for programme execution and monitoring. We argue that programme adoption is more likely if the programmes in question are compatible with the ideological leanings of the government, fit with the international social practice and compatible with already existing schemes. However, some similarities between the employment programmes in South Asia could be the result of the influence of external development actors with the result that former rather different programmes become alike. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The main research question explores the extent to which the Faroese themselves have determined the development of their education system, and the extent to which Norwegian and most of all Danish influences have been crucial in this process. Previous research on the development of Faroese education is insufficient and few secondary sources are available. Therefore, this article is largely based on primary sources, such as legislation, curricula, circulars, official reports and interviews. The analysis shows that changes in governance structures and economic conditions are determinant factors that have had impact on the extent to which the Faroese have been responsible for their own educational development. Strong economic growth in recent years has allowed the Faroe Islands to adopt what is considered to be "global education" and "international standards." © Nina Volckmar.},

The article shows how the establishment of a regional sector-based institution like the Health Council of UNASUR triggered the diffusion of similar policies by reducing transaction costs and increasing information exchanges among member states’ health bureaucracies. I argue that RIOs such as UNASUR catalyse transnational diffusion not by enforcing binding regional norms (as in the case of the EU), but by bridging member states’ shared functional needs and asymmetric capacities in specific policy areas.

But what explains variation in the degree of influence that governing parties have on their foreign counterparts? We argue that clarity of responsibility within government, or the concentration of executive responsibility in the hands of a dominant governing party, allows parties to learn from the most obviously electorally successful incumbents. It therefore enhances the cross-national diffusion of party programs. To test this expectation, we analyze parties' policy positions in twenty-six established democracies since 1977. Our results indicate that parties disproportionately learn from and emulate dominant, high-clarity foreign incumbents. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the political consequences of government clarity and sheds new light on the heuristics that engender party-policy diffusion by demonstrating that the most visible foreign incumbents, whose platforms have yielded concentrated power in office, influence party politics "at home". © The Author (2017).

This paper develops this field of study by demonstrating empirically the leverage of the 'sustained organisational influence' theory of policy diffusion. Specifically, it focuses on the role of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in diffusing the Stand Your Ground policy across US state legislatures. By comparing ALEC's template policy to bills introduced and legislation subsequently enacted within state legislatures, we demonstrate that ALEC has positioned itself as a 'super interest group', exerting sustained organisational influence across an expanding number of states. In doing so, this paper moves theory beyond the typical advocacy coalition framework that implicitly assumes policymaking occurs discretely among specialists on an issue-by-issue basis. It also highlights the democratic implications of the role of super interest groups in shaping policy behind the scenes. © Policy Press 2019.},

	abstract = {Research on policy diffusion has recently paid more attention to ideological patterns of policy adoption. Grossback, Nicholson-Crotty, and Peterson operationalized a measure of ideological diffusion; however, it has not been consistently calculated in subsequent studies. This is mainly due to difficulties in interpreting how to measure ideological distance based solely on the original article. Specifically, there are three factors that prevent common measurement of the concept: starting values, adoption ties, and weighting of recent adoptions. Recommendations are made for each of these. The purpose is to establish a consistent ideological distance measure. To illustrate, a replication of the original lottery diffusion model in the authors’ paper shows how the results change with different measurement choices. Consistently measuring this concept is important as scholars increasingly recognize that states do not always follow their geographic neighbors but increasingly their ideological “neighbors.” © The Author(s) 2020.},

Second, how and why are pioneering climate policy instruments modified by later adopters? In both cases, the 2008 UK Climate Change Act was a source of inspiration in the early stages, particularly for civil society campaigns. Thereafter, domestic interests mobilised to remove from legislative proposals the most pioneering and ambitious parts of the UK model.

Most seem to have acquiesced in this global policy-making, as they have with other ‘global’ declarations, in the expectation that it would have little effect on them. Nor, in Southern Africa, is there clear evidence of any significant effect. Even the social protection strategy documents adopted by either the African Union or national governments, typically written by external consultants, have generally avoided direct use of the concept of the social protection floor, while reiterating the commitment to ‘comprehensive’ (and appropriate) social protection that predated the ILO-led initiative. The trajectory of actual policy reform in Southern African countries does not appear to have changed. There continues to be a disjuncture between ‘global social policy’ at the global and African levels. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Federal governments have adopted different mechanisms to guarantee minimum standards across the countries, but historical trajectories and widely shared policy ideas are also mentioned as relevant in diffusion processes. This paper focuses on the influence of federalism in policy diffusion at the subnational level in Brazil. The 1988 Constitution consolidated decentralization of the Brazilian education policy but required cooperation between states and municipalities. The lack of a national definition resulted in a great variety of cooperative programmes and coordination arrangements, allowing the identification of similarities and differences among their diffusion processes. This article shows that state governments are the main policy-makers regarding cooperation, which highlights that the role of the federal government does not entirely explain these processes. Nevertheless, policy trajectories and the movement of ideas and people municipalities were keys for policy diffusion. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {While the merits and perils of privatization have remained a contentious and often polarizing debate, privatization of public services remains commonplace throughout the world. For instance, over the last several decades, U.S. governments at all levels have routinely pursued contracting arrangements for corrections management, known popularly as prison privatization. In this article, state prison privatization (SPP) is examined in three ways. First, we use an externally focused policy diffusion framework to help explain the adoption of SPP-enabling legislation across U.S. states. Second, we explore the extent to which the American Legislative Exchange Council has influenced the adoption of prison privatization legislation. Third, we explore the role of state wealth inequality in determining a state's propensity to adopt prison privatization policies. Examining state-level data from 1979 to 2010, this article finds empirical support for each of these key theoretical assertions. Furthermore, we find evidence that the external diffusion effect may vary depending on the political orientation of the state. Related Articles: Butz, Adam M., Michael P. Fix, and Joshua L.

Neo-institutionalism and world systems theory differ on whether focus should be given to international convergence or domestic adaptation. Studies addressing historical and contextual dimensions of policy diffusion are relevant as they will further specify the nature of the extranational effects on national policies. The case of Argentina’s national higher education policy is particularly relevant to this literature due to political and academic traditions that have inhibited the diffusion of many global trends into the country. This study offers a comparative historical analysis of the issues that have been prioritized in Argentina’s higher education policy over three decades (1983–2015), the strategies employed by higher education actors, and the socioeconomic and political factors that led to unique manifestations there of global trends, such as massification, privatization, and internationalization. The paper shows how Argentina’s system became massified without privatization, why privatization failed to reach the levels of other Latin American countries, and how an internationalization strategy via regionalization was a means to lockdown domestic reforms. © 2016 Society for Research into Higher Education.},

A notable exception is a study by Brooks, which concludes that conditional cash transfers (CCTs) are more likely to be adopted by divided governments and in places where neighbouring, democratic countries have already implemented them. This comparative research tests Brooks’ findings in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and finds that they largely do not apply. Instead, programme funder is offered as a better explanation of cash transfer adoption in SSA from 1990 to 2011. The results show that CCTs are adopted in poor African countries with financial support from the World Bank, while unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) are adopted across a range of countries with the support of various donors. This research contributes to the literature by showing quantitatively that donor support may be more important than some domestic factors, such as bureaucratic capacity, for understanding CCT implementation in SSA. © The Author(s) 2017.},

Panel data logistic regression analyses revealed that active shooter incidents, the percentage of Republicans in state government, citizen political ideology, and policy diffusion influence the introduction of campus carry legislation. In addition, survival analysis showed that conservative citizen political ideology and anti-gun-control interests are positively related to the enactment of campus carry laws. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis of the policy process related to campus carry legislation. It expands the empirical scope of higher education policy research by considering a social problem that, like free speech and transgender “bathroom bills,” is only indirectly related to student achievement but nevertheless a high priority for some state legislators. Importantly, the results underscore the importance of examining how the influences of state characteristics and interstate dynamics vary across stages of the policy process. © 2020 AERA.},

When MPs make such references, the diffusion of policy ideas from one country context to another can occur. This article explores policy diffusion in plenary debates by answering the following questions: to what extent do references by MPs to the policies of other countries change over time and across policy areas; and what are the country- and policy-specific drivers of, respectively, the number of references to other countries and how MPs use information on policy experiences from other country contexts? The results of the analysis of Dutch Lower House debates on education and environmental policies for the period 1995-2012 show that the cross-national diffusion of policy ideas by MPs follows a punctuated equilibrium logic. Moreover, Dutch MPs refer more often to policies of larger countries and of EU member states. Finally, in policy fields with a high likelihood of externalities, the diffusion of policy ideas from the three countries most referred to by MPs occurs mainly through the mechanism of interdependence. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

This paper introduces new data and methods to move from empirical analyses of single policies to the analysis of comprehensive populations of policies and rigorously inferred diffusion networks. We have gathered policy adoption data appropriate for estimating policy innovativeness and tracing diffusion ties in a targeted manner (e.g., by policy domain, time period, or policy type) and extended the development of methods necessary to accurately and efficiently infer those ties. Our state policy innovation and diffusion (SPID) database includes 728 different policies coded by topic area. We provide an overview of this new dataset and illustrate two key uses: (i) static and dynamic innovativeness measures and (ii) latent diffusion networks that capture common pathways of diffusion between states across policies. The scope of the data allows us to compare patterns in both across policy topic areas. We conclude that these new resources will enable researchers to empirically investigate classes of questions that were difficult or impossible to study previously, but whose roots go back to the origins of the political science policy innovation and diffusion literature. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization},

	abstract = {This multiple-site case study of 24 intermediary organizations (IOs) engaged in postsecondary public policy examined how they identify policy issues and move issues, problems, and solutions onto the higher education policy agenda. Specifically, this study used agenda-setting theory to examine how IOs construct higher education policy issues, problems, and solutions, and the processes they employ to set the higher education policy agenda. IO information production and use were of particular interest to this study. The findings demonstrate that IOs engage in multiple agenda-setting processes including coalition building, hosting convenings, storytelling, publishing policy agendas, and leveraging focusing events. Some IOs position themselves as honest information brokers without obvious political agendas; others deliberately advocate for policy change. Regardless of how they positioned themselves, all IOs examined in this study used information strategically—either information created by the IOs themselves or secondary data and information from other sources—to identify issues and construct problems and solutions. Pre-vious to this study, research had explored the outcomes of IO agenda-setting activities including how they successfully promote interstate policy diffusion and influence the policy formation process. This study significantly uses agenda-setting theory to expose the processes IOs use to set the postsecondary policy agenda. The findings also surfaced an echo-chamber effect among IOs coalescing around a few issues (specifically, college access and affordability) at the exclusion of other issues that warrant policymaker attention such as Indigenous students which was prioritized by just one of the 24 IOs studied. © 2021 Association for the Study of Higher Education.},

We find that countries directly copy 8% of text on average, but that refugee policies copy significantly more text than fertility policies. We also find that poorer countries borrow more text, and that other countries’ policies are preferred to international templates (such as UN conference programs of action, or international conventions). We find no effect on copying of countries’ connections through geographic proximity, regional organizations, or trade.

We use the concept of an ‘instrument constituency’ to delineate and trace the various actors and channels involved in the diffusion of CCTs.

Free-riding would imply that neighboring communities might choose not to participate in the CRS because they perceive that their community benefits from surrounding communities’ participation. Results indicate that a community’s decision to participate in the CRS is not influenced by the characteristics of or the behavior of their neighbors.

In a globalized world, where state boundaries are permeable and public policy travels transnationally, the diffusion of policies is what naturally connects domestic to international policy. The recent surge of publications in the field consolidated an important and dense body of knowledge. However, after years of research, there now seems stasis if not stagnation, with relatively little conceptual innovation. In this article we propose to address fresh avenues for future research, considering what needs to be better understood in the policy diffusion phenomenon. The new frontiers to be explored are not only associated to heuristic dimensions of the field, but also to empirical dynamics that emerged in the past years. We highlight six new frontiers for policy transfer and diffusion research: (1) the role of the private sector and consultants; (2) internationalization of domestic coalitions; (3) transnational spaces and transfer agents; (4) policy translation; (5) resistance to transfer; and (6) South-South or South-North transfers. © 2018, Fundacao Getulio Vargas.

	abstract = {Since the 1990s, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have adopted long-term care social insurance (LTCI) systems to face the growing “aging crisis” in their countries. The comparative scholarship suggests the diffusion of the Japanese model among East Asian states. Bridging policy learning, agenda setting, and historical institutionalist approaches, this study comparatively examines how ideational and institutional processes have impacted political competition and ultimately the adoption of LTCIs in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. I argue that each country's LTCI design differs greatly from one another, displaying distinctive forms of institutional bricolage—not institutional isomorphism. In this process, time has been a crucial factor. Time affects ideational, institutional, and political processes differently. The relative weight of ideational and institutional processes at a particular moment in time and their evolution over time has a significant impact on whether policy change occurs, and whether this change may gradually undermine the logic of welfare regimes.

Changes in community behaviour are very important, because of the increased vulnerability of people affected by diarrheal diseases, especially in the Pemulutan region, Ogan Ilir Regency, South Sumatra Province. The STBM policy can be achieved through policy diffusion which is influenced by factors of innovation and adoption by the community. The study tried to describe the implementation of STBM policies. The study used a qualitative approach, supported by primary and secondary data obtained through in-depth interviews and observation techniques. The results showed that the process of innovation and adoption of the STBM implementation policy in the Pemulutan region had not yet run optimally, although the community realized that the policy was very beneficial to improve the quality of life of sanitation environment. Various obstacles still occur including the content and policy context factors that are understood by the community, integrated service post (posyandu) cadres, and midwives as technical implementers in implementing policies. © 2020.

Guided by theoretical insights on policy diffusion literature, our findings propose that a partial diffusion (emulation between EU and China) exists, in which China has been keen to learn from European virtues to combine equality with economic growth. With regard to instruments provided by the flexicurity strategy, more learning than mimicking has occurred, that is, the Chinese have learned about the aspects of active labour market policies, public employment services and training services to embrace flexible labour market arrangements to rapidly adjust to changing labour market conditions as well as those aspects strengthening the basic social (insurance) safety nets to promote inclusive growth in a harmonious society. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.},

Supplementing research within public administration on innovation with the related literature on policy diffusion, this article examines how external factors such as conformity pressure from institutionalized models, performance information from other organizations, and political pressure affect innovation adoption. By the use of two survey experiments in very different political contexts—Texas and Denmark—and a difference-in-differences analysis exploiting a reform of the political governance of public schools in Denmark, we find that public managers respond to political pressure. We find no indications that they emulate institutionalized models or learn from performance information from other organizations when they adopt organizational innovations. The results thereby point to political pressure as an important factor behind large-scale adoptions of organizational innovations in the public sector. Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In this paper, we ask whether, in the presence of direct democratic institutions, voters’ actions in vetoing a decision or inaugurating a policy by a binding initiative in their jurisdiction have spillover effects on the actions of voters in neighboring jurisdictions. We collect (and make available) data on 3300 initiatives in German towns from 2002 to 2014 and match these to panel data on the towns’ sociodemographic and fiscal characteristics. We apply an instrumental variables approach and find that a jurisdiction’s probability of hosting an initiative is positively driven by the neighbors’ direct democratic activity. The size of the estimated average effect peaks around a 20 km neighborhood—where a standard deviation change of neighbors’ activity increases the probability of hosting an initiative by 5 percentage points—then gradually declines and fades away after around 60 km. This effect is driven by spillovers in similar policy areas and by successful initiatives, and is stronger in towns with relatively more information flows (measured by newspaper consumption and commuter flows). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

By comparing the implementation of the Bologna declaration in the Portuguese and Finnish higher education systems, this paper reflects on the different permutations of cultural-political changes wrought by the Europeanisation of higher education. Analysing policy implementation is thus considered essential to understand (effects of) policy change. This research adds to the literature on higher education policy the voices of practioners drawn from 47 interviews of system and institutional key actors in both countries. It is argued that while Portugal has a top-down tradition of policy implementation, Finland has been following a hybrid model of decision-making, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches. Empirical data challenge the importance of the national cultural dimension because, as is shown here, interviewees' perceptions differ more according to their role rather than their nationality. The apparent lack of visibility of national differences is explained by convergent trends such as managerialism and subsequent implications for the academic profession. © 2019, © 2019 European Sociological Association.},

Using a Cox proportional hazards model on state-level data from years 2000 to 2013, this study analyzes the latest wave of policies that embed base appropriations into the state budget to fund student outcomes. Results indicate that having a greater proportion of bordering performance funding states diminishes the likelihood of policy adoption, capturing a “reverse policy diffusion” effect. States with Republican-controlled legislatures, more professionalized legislatures, and rapid growth in unemployment rates are more likely to adopt the policy, while those with higher educational attainment levels and more bachelor’s degrees awarded per student are less likely. Implications include the surprising finding of reverse policy diffusion, which suggests that states are delaying adoption until after they can observe the political consequences and impacts of the policy in neighboring states. Findings point to a policy learning effect—by observing other state’s experiences, policymakers can make more informed decisions about whether to pursue performance funding as an accountability tool. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

It elucidates the interactions of Brazil’s state and non-state actors with international bureaucrats, and their role in framing the strategy and recommendations promoted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and Portuguese-speaking Community of Countries regarding the challenge of tackling food insecurity. The research builds on semi-structured interviews and a significant number of institutional documents, and combines constructivist international relations theory and sociological approaches to policy transfer/diffusion to explore the circulatory processes of policymaking. Aside from enhancing understanding of the micro-dynamics of framing and diffusion of policy ideas and prescriptions in IOs, the article provides information on the dissemination of policy solutions from the global south towards IOs and subsequently, to other developing countries. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

We approach these issues from the other direction by directly analyzing a key policymaking input—information about others’ policies. Moreover, we do so by investigating policy diffusion in cities rather than states. Using a survey of U.S. mayors, more specifically, mayors’ own lists of cities they look to for ideas, we find evidence that distance, similarity, and capacity all influence the likelihood of a policy maker looking to a particular jurisdiction for policy information. We also consider whether these traits are complements or substitutes and provide some evidence for the latter. Specifically, we find that, at times, mayors eschew similarity and distance to look to highly respected “high capacity” cities but that there is no tradeoff between distance and similarity. © 2018 University of Utah.},

Studies stemming from world society consider how state ties to newly emergent global norms regarding the treatment of LGBT communities are a driver of this process. A shortcoming of these studies, however, is that they do not adequately consider which type of ties to global norms are most meaningful for policy adoption. Considering the ever-increasing notion that LGBT rights are human rights, this study contrasts the role of human rights international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and LGBT INGOs on LGBT policy diffusion between 1991 and 2015. While previous studies assume a global norm exists, focus on a narrow band of policies, or restrict analyses to key geographic areas, this study develops a new measure of global LGBT norms and offers a comprehensive LGBT Policy Index for a global sample of 156 countries. Through pooled cross-sectional time series with fixed effects, the results demonstrate that human rights INGOs are not adequate vehicles for pressuring national adoption of LGBT policies. Instead, targeted advocacy efforts, embodied through LGBT INGOs, are required in order for policy adoption to transpire. © The Author(s) 2018.

The objective has been to adjust science and technology (S&T) finance policy tools, and to continually optimize an environment of financial support for S&T innovation and related public policies. Studying the diffusion mechanisms of the S&T finance activities in the policy documents jointly issued by these ministries cannot only reflect the intersection and linkages between S&T activities and finance and taxation affairs, but can also create a scientific and feasible research path for the ‘black box’ that is the S&T finance policy process. Based on a review of policy diffusion theory and related literature, and taking China’s S&T finance policy as the research subject, 367 central government policies and 3869 local government policies issued between 1981 and 2015 were collected using the Tsinghua University Government Documents Information System (GDIS). By analyzing the external attributes of the policy literature network, and the timing of keywords used by the internal tools of the policy literature, the process and characteristics of the policy diffusion of S&T achievements transformation were observed along the four dimensions of intensity, breadth, speed, and direction. © 2017, © 2017 Zhejiang University.},

It forms part of a broader trend of countries enacting overarching national framework climate change legislation, with the UK Climate Change Act of 2008 considered to be the pioneering legislation. This article seeks to answer two questions. First, to what extent did Irish policy-makers and other stakeholders draw explicitly on the example of the UK Climate Change Act in developing the Irish climate law? Second, to what extent was the development of the climate law in Ireland characterised by convergence towards the UK Climate Change Act, and how can we explain the observed level of convergence? Using a framework drawn from policy diffusion studies, the article argues that the development of Irish climate legislation can be characterised as partial policy diffusion from UK. The broad concept of overarching national climate legislation travelled from the UK, as did certain limited design features. However, domestic politics–in particular vigorous lobbying by business and farming groups–and divergent circumstances constrained the process of policy diffusion. © 2017 Political Studies Association of Ireland.},

The potential policy “lender” is China whereas the potential policy “borrower” is Ethiopia. The object of policy transfer is Transit Oriented Development (TOD). A new, world-class metro system has been partly built in Hangzhou, which presents an opportunity to study TOD development in a Chinese context. In Addis Ababa, the first light-rail transit system in sub-Saharan Africa was built in 2015 through capital funding from China and is being operated by Chinese companies. Despite this connection, the study reveals little evidence that any direct policy transfer has occurred between the two countries. More than policy transfer, this is a case of global policy diffusion, which is facilitated by new communication media and the globalization of planning practice. © Chia-Lin Chen, Haixiao Pan, Qing Shen and James Jixian Wang 2020.

Why have some states have declared SOEs when others have not? Our legal analysis suggests that although international law provides states with the option of declaring an SOE and derogating from human rights obligations to ensure the life of the nation, other ways to handle the pandemic without declaring an SOE do exist. Our theoretical analysis leads to three main propositions centred on the impact of regional diffusion, democratic institutions, and pandemic preparedness. Our empirical analysis combines a range of quantitative data sources to analyse the SOE decisions of 180 states during the first half of 2020. The results suggest that states’ declarations of SOEs are driven by both external and internal factors. A permissive regional environment, characterised by many simultaneously declared SOEs, may reduce the reputational and political costs of emergency powers, making their employment more palatable. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, have shaped governments’ decisions. Weak democracies with poor preparedness have been considerably more likely to opt for an SOE than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {As renewable energy supply chains have grown increasingly globalized, national clean energy transitions have become highly influenced by international dynamics. However, these dynamics are themselves collectively shaped by domestic policy that drives the deployment of renewables. While spatial spillovers of domestic renewable energy policies have been studied on an aggregate level regarding policy diffusion or the flows of technology across countries, implications on an actor-level have been largely neglected. This article addresses this gap by analyzing global patterns of market openings for wind, solar PV, and biomass, focusing on the role of private project developers in developing countries. We use a mixed method design, based on a newly merged dataset encompassing eighty countries, and on interviews with pioneering project developers. Results highlight how patterns in market openings are shaped considerably by technology characteristics. Further, empirical results show international private developers are a key first mover in many developing countries. We explore drivers for this internationalization trend, including the impact of international developers' home country policies and the accumulation of tacit knowledge from home country markets for market openings abroad. Finally, we discuss implications for industrial policy and argue for further research on global spillovers of national policies on the actor-level. © V.K.

	abstract = {The role of philanthropic foundations in the policy process is largely hidden and thus significantly under conceptualized. In this paper, we argue that several key characteristics of foundations serve as advantages for them to play an intermediary role in different stages of the policy process. By leveraging their independent resources, credibility, and strategic giving, they are able to build coalitions of interest to advance and secure preferred policy alternatives through agenda setting, policy diffusion, and coordinating implementation efforts. We provide evidence for this intermediary role through two qualitative case studies, (1) the Pew Charitable Trust’s efforts to promote universal pre-kindergarten, 2002–2012, and (2) multiple foundations’ role in supporting extended foster care in California, 2008–2012. In both cases, we find that foundations wielded significant political power within policy communities by serving as central hubs of information, facilitating coordinated action, incentivizing action, and connecting diverse actors. This allows them to play a crucial, yet veiled, role in attempts to advance policy change. This phenomenon may be welcomed for supporting evidence-based policymaking and capacity building, but is troubling in regards to transparency and accountability. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.},

In so doing, the article centres on a geographical region that has been unconsidered in the policy diffusion literature and, particularly, responds to calls for research into the effects of policy characteristics on diffusion mechanisms and patterns. This rationale beget methods that differed from the predominant use of quantitative, dichotomous indicators of policy diffusion, instead integrating data from global, international and national policy documents, from a review of SDP literature, and from stakeholder interviews in Ghana and Tanzania. Patterns of increasing governmental engagement with, but limited implementation of, SDP policies contrasted with the significant expansion of SDP provision by diverse NGOs. In turn, these patterns represented the varying influence of different diffusion mechanisms on state and non-state actors. Compared with the diffusion of other types of policies, these findings indicated the effects of an instrumental, malleable but complex global policy model for SDP diffusion. There is, therefore, significant value in further research that examines how policy diffusion may depend on the configuration of particular policy characteristics, mechanisms and actors. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

On the surface, it is very similar to other cap-and-trade programs, but in practice many detailed differences reflect active efforts by California policy-makers to avoid flaws that they saw in other systems, such as the EU ETS and the US East Coast’s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. We assess how California’s cap-and-trade system emerged, the significance of policy diffusion, and the lessons for other trading systems by applying two broad sets of theoretical frames—the role of policy diffusion and the role of organized local political concerns. We find that despite the signature status of the trading system, California mostly relies on much less transparent and more costly direct regulation. We also find that California’s cap-and-trade system has developed mostly in its own, special political context, which hampers the feasibility of cross-border trading. © 2017 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The findings suggest that geographic diffusion plays an important role in state lawsuits against for-profit colleges, although the specific mechanisms of diffusion may differ across regions. Moreover, loan repayment rates of for-profit students appear to contribute to the likelihood of a lawsuit being filed as states may seek to intervene when objective metrics suggest that students and state economic interests seem to be harmed.

Building on an exhaustive and fine-grained dataset of PTAs' environmental clauses, this article makes two contributions. First, it shows that the United States and the European Union have initially favored different approaches to environmental protection in their PTAs. The United States' concerns over regulatory sovereignty and level playing field have led to a legalistic and adversarial approach, while the European Union's concerns for policy coherence have led to a more procedural and cooperative approach. Second, this article provides evidence that European and American trade negotiators have gradually converged on a shared set of environmental norms. Although the United States and the European Union initially pursued different objectives, they learned from each other and drew similar lessons. As a result, recent American agreements have become more European-like, and European agreements have become more Americanized. This article concludes that U.S. and E.U. approaches, far from being incompatible, can usefully be combined and reinforce each other. © V.K.

Drawing on immigration policy data offering unprecedented historical and geographical coverage, we analyse the drivers of immigration reforms in 21 Western immigration countries between 1970 and 2012. Our results show that there is no robust effect of the political ideology of governments and parliaments on the overall restrictiveness of immigration reforms. Partisan effects are limited to certain migration policy areas, primarily to integration policies, and to certain migrant groups, particularly asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. In contrast, political party ideology does not fundamentally shape decisions on the core of immigration regimes, such as entry policies or policies towards labour and family migrants. Our findings also showcase the importance of international policy diffusion and of trade-offs between reforms in different policy areas. Overall, the analysis highlights that although immigration is subject to heated debates in the public sphere and extensive political bargaining, the actual policies enacted seem primarily driven by factors such as economic growth, social welfare protection and the structure of political systems that are largely independent of the political ideology of parties in power. © 2020 The Author(s).

Following these successes, the dissemination of microfinance institutions is seen all over the globe. Brazil stands out for being a pioneer in this field, having developed a microcredit program even before Grameen Bank, from Bangladesh, the main institution responsible for the spread of microfinance worldwide. This paper aims to understand the social practices, power relations and institutional infrastructure surrounding microfinance, taking the Global South as a starting point and focusing on Brazil. In so doing, it looks at the policy mobility of microfinance, shining light on how policy diffusion and transfer are entangled in the practices and processes of different institutions, actors and networks. It identifies two approaches within the formulation and practice of microfinance historically. Four illustrative cases are discussed in order to present the mobility of microfinance policies in Brazil drawing from the international scenario. The paper’s point of departure for the analysis of the mobility of microfinance is that policy trajectories are fraught with ambivalence and contradiction.

This is mainly so for three reasons: exchange of information between parties across levels, national parties’ attempts to influence European Union policies, and career incentives of representatives at the supranational level. We test our theoretical framework using unique data on parliamentary questions asked by Danish representatives (the Folketing and the European Parliament, 1999–2009) and a dyadic data structure. Our results show that parties’ policy issues—in particular those over which the European Union holds legislative power—transfer across the national and European levels on a regular basis and that issues are more likely to travel within parties. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {Policy diffusion literature generally studies the adoption of similar policies across jurisdictions, but often overlooks how opposing policies or legal constraints may influence the enactment of rigid state constitutional amendments. The current study models the spread of state constitutional amendments designed to prevent future policy change. Using conditional event history analysis on all states from 1999 to 2011 the empirical models analyze the spread of same-sex marriage prohibitive amendments across the United States. Findings suggest that the nearby adoption of opposing policies encourage state legislatures to introduce prohibitive amendments. The regional diffusion effect suggests that policymakers “protect” their jurisdiction from nearby diffusion forces or seek electoral gains by symbolic protection by committing an already existing policy into the rigid state constitutional framework. Regional policy diffusion may, therefore, be explained by a countermovement mechanism unique to the state constitutional amendment process. This protective strategy among state legislatures and citizens may explain why many policy areas are frequently codified in state constitutions. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization},

How do these markets function and what is the role of design? Carrying out a ground-breaking analysis of their design and diffusion, this book covers all the major carbon market systems and processes around the world: the EU, RGGI, California, Tokyo, New Zealand, Australia, China, South Korea and Kazakhstan. It offers a systematic, in-depth discussion and comparison of the key design features in these systems with expert contributors exploring how, and to what extent, these features have been shaped by central policy diffusion mechanisms and domestic politics. By focussing on the specific design features of the instruments used, this volume makes important contributions to diffusion theory, highlighting how ETS diffusion processes more often have resulted in design divergence than convergence, and discussing the implications of this finding for the vision of linked systems in the post-Paris era. It will be of significant interest to a broad audience interested in the emergence, evolution, functioning and interaction of carbon markets. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Jørgen Wettestad and Lars H.

The case studies indicated that performance-based budgeting was generally part of a broader program of governmental reform, that executive agencies were more important than parliaments in managing it, that it became quite important in budget- and policy-making, and that implementing it faced a significant number of challenges. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

We found that state governments that had adopted OGD policies earlier had active policy entrepreneurs (or lead departments/agencies) responsible for the policy innovation diffusion across the different government departments. We also found that their efficacy ranking was relatively high in terms of OGD portal openness when openness is measured by the greater number of datasets proactively and systematically published through their OGD portals. These findings have important implications for the role played by OGD policy entrepreneurs in openly sharing the government-owned datasets with the public. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Utilizing data from all 50 states as of 2008, our findings show that the vertical diffusion of a policy is reliant on a state’s fiscal capacity and the personnel capacity of the local government.

The paper shows that the financial and political support for Dutch Delta Planning expertise in Vietnam needed to be actively and continuously wielded to keep the process going. We conclude that there is merit in understanding policy transfer as a process of translation between many actors, all of whom change, learn, and influence not just each other but also what is transferred.

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, research on policy adoption and diffusion has grown rapidly. Despite the relatively large number of publications, however, little attention has been paid to the important question of why a policy is differently implemented or diffused across governments. To answer this question and improve our understanding of local policy choice beyond widely cited neighboring influences, we closely examine the roles of three main policy actors—internal actors, external actors, and go-betweens—in the local policy diffusion process, drawing particularly upon property tax reassessment scenarios. In addition, we focus on nested institutional arrangements, including form of government and type of property tax assessor, that affect the policy decisions of internal actors. Using data on cities and towns in New York State for 1993-2010, we estimate event history models of property tax reassessment activities. Our findings reveal that regional interactions with neighbors that have already adopted the policy and top-down go-betweens through positive inducements can help facilitate property tax reassessment across municipalities. Reformed municipal governments in the council-manager form, along with appointed assessors, are also most likely to adopt reassessment policy frequently, compared with other institutional arrangements. Overall, this study advances the policy diffusion literature by exploring the roles of different influences through a more detailed, broader approach. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

Recent research suggests, however, that learning is more than simply observing policy adoption in other jurisdictions and must also include an assessment of the outcomes or effectiveness of those policies. This article argues that an assessment of the ability to implement an innovation is also likely to be a component of the learning process. Specifically, it argues that potential adopters are likely to ask not only, “Was the policy effective in other states that adopted it?” but also, “Can we make the policy work for us?” We test hypotheses drawn from this general argument in a directed dyad analysis of renewable portfolio standards in the American states between 1997 and 2009. Results indicate that shared implementation environments among jurisdictions help determine the impact that information about policy effectiveness has on adoption decisions. These findings suggest that implementation concerns may be an important part of the policy learning process. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

The Torch Programme's procedural practices challenge widely shared assumptions about the dirigiste character of Chinese innovation policy. It combines centralized definition of programme objectives with extensive local implementation experiments. As three case studies demonstrate, bottom-up policy innovations are effectively fed back into national programme adjustments and into horizontal policy diffusion. The array of organizational patterns and promotional instruments that emerges from competitive "experimentation under the shadow of hierarchy" (ESH) goes way beyond what could have been initiated from top down. We hypothesize that the procedural strengths displayed in the Torch Programme may provide better indicators of future innovative potential in China's high-technology zones than retrospective statistical indices and benchmarks that are derived from OECD experience. © The China Quarterly, 2013.},

A mechanism between vertical government intervention and diffusion of innovation in public services is established by conducting a comparative case study between Sichuan and Tianjin. Administrative commands facilitate the formation of the 'mandatory policy diffusion' that rapidly diffuses policy instruments. Competition in the performance evaluation-based personnel system contributes to the formation of 'championship policy diffusion', which leads to the divergence of policy instruments in neighbouring local governments. Therefore, classic theoretical hypotheses on geographical proximity, competition, and vertical intervention concerning innovation diffusion need to be modified. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

Individual-level data on the head librarians of all of the township libraries in Taichung City were collected through survey questionnaires.

	abstract = {The contours of Turkey's climate policy have remained almost intact over the past two decades. Being an Annex I party without any mitigation commitments, Turkey maintains a peculiar position under UNFCCC. Subsequent to 12years of delay in signing both the Framework Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, Turkey had the highest rate of increase in greenhouse gas emissions among the Annex I countries with 110.4% upsurge in the period 1990 and 2013. Yet with the new climate regime now in place, the country's mitigation pledges fall short of expectations both in terms of realistic projections and its ambition to step up in the post-2020 period. Climate policies in Turkey, an EU candidate and OECD founding member with a growing economy, remain under-investigated. Although the country has a wide range of policies and institutions in place, it shows limited progress in addressing climate change. Based on evidence from the literature, we observe that climate policies operationalize in Turkey insofar as they do not directly confront developmental ambitions, leaving policy diffusion with limited success. To provide a historic overview, we focus on climate policy development, actors, processes, and contemporary trends. Evidence shows that these are highly ridden with the politics of special circumstances: a notion that Turkey employs to refrain from bindings commitments. In order to go beyond special circumstances discourse, we argue the need for a bold policy shift in Turkey, a country subject to adverse impacts of climate change and high-carbon lock-in risk due to development policy preferences. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

By analyzing policies already implemented in industrialized countries, we focus on the diffusion but not the invention of climate-relevant policies. We look at four different types of policies (renewable energy targets, feed-in tariffs, other financial incentives and framework policies) and consider both domestic factors and international diffusion mechanisms utilizing a discrete-time events history model with a logit link on a self-compiled dataset of grid-based electricity policy adoption in 112 developing and emerging countries from 1998 to 2009. In general, we find stronger support for the domestic determinants of policy adoption, but also substantial influence of international factors. Countries with a larger population and more wealth have a higher probability of adopting renewable energy policies. Only in some specific cases do natural endowments for producing renewable energy encourage governments to adopt policies, and hydro power resources even correlate negatively with the adoption of targets. Among the international determinants, emulation from colonial peers and membership within the EU seem to facilitate policy adoption. International climate finance is less relevant, as the Global Environmental Facility and the Clean Development Mechanism may only increase the adoption of frameworks and targets, but they have no influence on tariffs and incentives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Conversely, stronger national and local identification is associated with weaker support for these values.

Informed by key concepts in policy process and feminist scholarship, it examines the evidence of Irish Aid's progress in this area. The author finds that gender equality has low salience in Irish Aid and a record of weak implementation. It is argued that while the adoption of a gender equality policy in Irish Aid reflects global policy diffusion, Ireland's rhetorical endorsement of gender equality in international affairs stems chiefly from an instrumental interest in the reputational gains it can offer and is indicative of the exercise of 'soft coercion' rather than of a principled interest in achieving gender equality. The weakness of state feminism in Ireland and the weak links between officials and women's movement actors are also factors. Further, while the disadvantage of low salience can be offset by the presence of effective 'policy entrepreneurs' using discretionary power to augment resources, this is not evident in Irish Aid in the case of the gender equality policy. Furthermore, the rising paradigm of 'managing for development results' poses new challenges to rights-based approaches to development, including gender mainstreaming. For these reasons, the gender equality policy in Irish Aid is at risk of continued dilution and perhaps disappearance.},

	abstract = {Cultural approaches to national policymaking have yielded much empirical evidence that national decision-making is greatly impacted by policy choices made in other countries. Considering that the common explanation of policy diffusion cannot explain all instances of isomorphism, this paper proposes an alternative way of operationalising interdependent decision-making. Drawing on emerging work in neoinstitutionalist world society theory, we suggest that the rise of global policy models can be explained by thinking of the world polity as a synchronised system in which national states keep an eye out on each others’ moves and, often, match them. As a consequence, global models are formed in parallel with their spread. We illustrate this argument by analysing the worldwide institutionalisation of national bioethics committees (NBCs). Using qualitative analysis of official documentation on NBCs, we trace how the institution has evolved into a widely recognised and codified format in four shifts–the appearance of an institutional category, construction of the paradigmatic model, networking and consultation by international organisations. We show how this analysis corrects for the assumption of rigid policy models in most diffusion research and offers new designs for empirical research. © 2016, © 2016 European Sociological Association.},

	abstract = {States have been widely criticized for failing to advance the international climate regime. Many observers now believe that a "new" climate governance is emerging through transnational and/or local forms of action that will eventually plug the resulting governance gaps. Yet states, which remain oddly absent from most discussions of the "new" governance, will remain key players as governance becomes more polycentric. This paper introduces a special issue that explores the ability of states to rise to these interconnected challenges through the analytical prism of policy innovation. It reveals that policy innovation is much more multi-dimensional than is often thought; it encompasses three vital activities: invention (centering on the 'source' of new policy elements), diffusion (that produces different 'patterns' of policy adoption), and the evaluation of the 'effects' that such innovations create in reality. The papers, which range from qualitative case studies to large '. n' quantitative studies, offer new insights into the varied roles that states play in relation to all three. They show, for instance that: the policy activity of states has risen dramatically in the past decade; that state innovation is affected to similar degrees by internal and external factors; and that policies that offer flexibility to target groups on how to meet policy goals are most effective but that voluntary reporting requirements are ineffective. This paper draws upon these and many other insights to offer a much more nuanced reflection on the future of climate governance; one that deservedly puts states at the front and center of analysis. © 2014 The Authors.},

This article analyzes the enactment of restrictions on smoking in bars and restaurants in 29 European countries - a conflictual issue which does not fit easily traditional party ideologies. Indeed, the comparative empirical analyses demonstrate that government ideological positions are not associated with the strictness and the timing of adoption of the smoking bans. On the other hand, economic factors like the scale of tobacco production in a country, smoking prevalence in society and public support for tough anti-smoking policy are all significantly related to the time it takes for a country to adopt smoking bans, and to the comprehensiveness and enforcement of these restrictions. In addition, horizontal policy diffusion is strongly implicated in the pattern of policy adoptions. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

We also find that factors such as innovativeness and proximity affect how often a state’s policies are studied. More generally, we find evidence of fairly sophisticated learning as policy makers looked at others’ policies in nuanced and varied ways.

As expanding tertiary education is an important policy worldwide, we use Trow’s classification to define two levels of tertiary education expansion: first, increasing gross tertiary enrollment rates above 15% (from elite to massified), and second, above 50% (from massified to universal). Analyzing a unique cross-national panel dataset, which spans the time period from 1999 to 2005, our findings show that both internal determinants (secondary education participation rates and the political landscape) as well as diffusion factors (proximity to a pioneering nation and regional variables) influence nations in setting tertiary enrollment policies. © 2014, The Author(s) 2014.},

The authors conduct an event history analysis of the spread ðhowever limitedÞ of abortion liberalization policies from 1960 to 2009. After identifying three dominant frames ða women’s rights frame, a medical frame, and a religious, natural family frameÞ, the authors find that indicators of a scientific, medical frame show consistent association with liberalization of policies specifying acceptable grounds for abortion. Women’s leadership roles have a stronger and more consistent liberalizing effect than do countries’ links to a global women’s rights discourse. Somewhat different patterns emerge around the likelihood of adopting an additional policy, controlling for first policy adoption. Even as support for women’s autonomy has grown globally, with respect to abortion liberalization, persistent, powerful frames compete at the global level, preventing robust policy diffusion. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

Design/methodology/approach – A document analysis of Swedish and German youth unemployment policies was conducted with regard to how the two welfare regimes’ policies define the underlying problem, the instruments through which this problem is tackled, and the aim of youth activation policies. Findings – The findings show congruency concerning the definitions of the problem of youth unemployment, in which the unemployed are regarded as lacking in discipline, as well as in the policies through which the problem is tackled: through conditionality and pastoral power as policy tools. The solution of the problem on the other hand, found in the notion of the ideal worker to be produced, diverges between active entrepreneurs in one country, and blue-collar workers in the other. The authors conclude that the introduction of supranational policy concepts is not a matter of mere implementation, and that concepts like activation are reinterpreted according to differing cultural ideologies and accommodated into the context of particular welfare states. Originality/value – This paper provides an innovative framework for the understanding of the influence of cultural understandings on policy making, but also on challenges facing activation governance on the one hand and European Union policy initiatives and transnational policy diffusion on the other. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The number of free trade agreements (FTAs) concluded by the United States of America (US) has grown vastly over the past two decades. While FTAs contribute to increased global competition and as such may also contribute to socially-undesirable practices in the area of working conditions and the environment, the proliferation in FTAs has paradoxically also augmented the potential for making free trade more fair as some of these agreements now include labour provisions. However, the question is whether these trade agreements have also actually diffused internationally recognised labour standards. This article studies the FTA the US signed in 2004 with a number of Central American countries and which, at a later stage, also included the Dominican Republic. This FTA is commonly referred to as CAFTA-DR and includes a chapter on labour standards. The article argues that the effects of the inclusion of labour standards in CAFTA-DR have been limited and therefore should be viewed as an unsuccessful attempt at policy transfer. This is illustrated by the case of Guatemala, a country known for its lack of respect for labour standards and which is currently the subject of a complaints procedure under the CAFTA-DR. It is maintained that this lack of effectiveness is the result of many factors. Among these is the weakness of the labour chapter of CAFTA-DR resulting from the fact that the chapter is the outcome of bargaining processes both within the US and between the US and Guatemala, where symbolic results were valued more highly than actual substance. © 2015 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

However, prolific scholarship has highlighted the transnational diffusion of policy innovations, but the insights provided – at least for policies – are limited by a ‘democracy bias’, that is, the focus of most studies is on democracies. This limitation concerns both the empirical scope of most diffusion studies and their theoretical underpinning. Furthermore, the emphasis placed on the diffusion mechanisms has hindered the development of conceptual frameworks that systematically account for political regime characteristics and their role for policy diffusion. To take a first step towards reducing this gap, we propose an alternative conceptual framework. It builds on the existing literature on policy diffusion, but shifts the perspective from the international to the national context. In the subsequent discussion we put forward a theoretical framework that explicitly accounts for the role of political regime types in policy diffusion and shifts the analytical focus from mechanisms to ‘routes’ of diffusion. © 2016 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

In a nutshell, the research has threefold objectives, it explores: the dynamics of the CSR conceptual development, sketching out the main contextual drivers leading to CSR policy importance in developed/developing countries; the CSR evolution in Indian scenario, pointing out India's cultural and institutional contextual factors; and the context of banking sector regulations on CSR policy and guidelines. The analysis is supported by a comparative multiple case study analysis, on three leading public banks: State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank. The rationale for case selection is based on the social and environmental implications of banking financial decisions on the matter. The banking sector is still at the initial stage of integrating CSR policies in their regulations. The findings reveal increasing attention among the banks towards the adoption of social banking regulations. There is a substantial body of empirical evidence showing that the newly CSR core values and guidelines at international level have often had little effect on CSR practice in the banking sector at the country level. The research shows that it is important to look at the CSR evolution through an integrated model of analysis, based on conceptual and empirical evidence. It pointed out an integrated model of analysis of the banking sector through the lens of comparative case studies. Copyright © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The issue of same-sex marriage and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality has received considerable attention from policy scholars. This is unsurprising given the issue is one of the defining social policy battles of the last decade. State governments at the forefront of this battle have responded by proposing a multitude of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender-related policies. In this study, we comparatively assess the diffusion of two of these policies across US states: the legal recognition of same-sex marriages and state constitutional amendments defining marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman. While previous studies have examined the diffusion of same-sex marriage bans across states, none have offered a comparative examination of how both sides of this contentious issue have advanced their policy preferences alongside each other. Using event history analysis, we analyze a unique set of covariates to test two diffusion hypotheses: learning and imitation. We find that for both policies, policy learning is the primary mechanism occurring, suggesting that policymakers learn from one another for the same policy area, even if the policies have different motives or objectives.

This regime of voluntary approaches to environmental policy innovations, lessondrawing and policy diffusion is very much a knowledge-driven effort to stimulate commitment to sustainable development. The regime is characterised by long-term goals, sector integration, stakeholder participation and activated self-regulation.

The data used is a macro-economic panel of 48 countries covering six three-year periods between 1995 and 2012.

Using an event history analysis, a traditional geographic model for policy diffusion is tested against a model where states learn from peer groups, defined by political culture. There is evidence for state learning within peer groups but less support for diffusion across state borders. Policy characteristics, environmental conditions, economic resources, and political constraints and opportunities are tested as drivers of differences in policy adoption. More than any other factor, politics and political culture explains the adoption of energy and climate-change policies. These results also suggest that restricted models that test geographical mechanisms of policy diffusion likely omit important characteristics that are correlated across states, leading to biased findings regarding the geographical state diffusion models in the extant literature. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

The second is the transition in Central and Eastern Europe in the last twenty years. Is it possible to identify alternative development paths and models inside the common market orientation and market economy trends in Europe? The authors first examine the phenomenon of neo-liberalism and deal with the extent to which the neoliberal reforms were implemented in five selected countries: Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia and Croatia. The authors use two compatible conceptual frameworks: public policy diffusion and Varieties of Capitalism (VoC), and complement this approach with political elements, including early transition developments. In recent years, VoC literature often referred to Slovenia (CME) and Estonia (LME) as two functional extremes in Central and Eastern Europe. Comparing the relevant indices, the authors confirm this view. Lithuania is found to be close to Estonia at the liberal market economy end of the spectrum, while Croatia is akin to Slovenia as a coordinated market economy. Latvia has been confirmed as inconsistently profiled. Ultimately, the authors investigate social effects of diverging paths to transition, implemented reforms and alternative models of capitalism in selected countries.},

Thus, both factors interact, magnifying each other's effects. The argument is corroborated by a quantitative analysis of the privatisation of telecommunications providers in the Western OECD world. A dyadic logit model shows that joint membership in international organisations increases the likelihood of policy convergence if governments face budget deficits. The argument of the article builds a bridge between theories of international organisations and domestic theories of policy making.

	abstract = {Unlike the U.S. Constitution, many state constitutions include provisions for regulating and legislating specific policy issues. Embedding policy proscriptions in state constitutions may impact the rate and likelihood of policy diffusion. To examine how the amendment process influences diffusion resulting from geographic competition, we estimate a well-known policy diffusion model, using state-sponsored lotteries as a case study. Our mixed model of survival analysis separately estimates amendments and lottery adoptions allowing for different covariates and baseline hazards in each model. We find that there are different diffusion effects for constitutional amendments and policy adoptions, that the two-step process requires a more professionalized legislature, and that amending the state constitution influences the timing of the adoption process. Once we take into consideration the two-step process of lottery diffusion, we find a conditional diffusion effect that is over twice as large as previous estimates, and an overall diffusion that is larger than estimates from event-history estimation, suggesting that the constitutional hurdle is an important determinant of policy adoption. These effects occur over the entire policy adoption phase (1961–2009), over multiple specifications of the baseline hazard, for alternate measures of diffusion, and for alternate model specifications, thereby suggesting that the constitutional hurdle is an important element of state policy, and it should be empirically considered in future models of policy diffusion. © 2015 Policy Studies Organization},

Some have speculated that this “pro-innovation bias” compromises scholars’ ability to draw valid inferences about the factors that influence the diffusion process. We argue that the study of interstate compacts in the United States provides an analytic opportunity to assess whether these concerns are warranted because it allows us to examine an entire universe of cases with unusually wide variability in their adoption patterns. Based on a pooled event history analysis of the interstate compacts that are open to all fifty states, we conclude that the tendency to limit diffusion research to widely adopted policies affects the results of previous studies. Specifically, it appears to lead scholars to systematically overestimate the impact of geographic diffusion pressures and policy attributes, and to underestimate the importance of professional associations and the opportunity to learn from previous adoptions. In sum, the longstanding concerns about a pro-innovation bias in diffusion research seem to be warranted. © 2016 University of Utah.},

An extensive set of studies assess PFP as largely unsuccessful in the federal government, and many of the private sector studies also found problems in PFP in the private sector. Yet, PFP continues to be adopted by governments in Europe, the United States and Australia. Our study examines the original adoption of PFP in 1978 to assess why it diffused so readily from the private sector to the federal government. We find PFP as a good example of Kingdon's (2002) garbage can decision making in which the policy champions presented PFP as a rational policy solution to widely perceived performance appraisal and reward problems at an opportune time. The PFP was trumpeted as an innovative policy but had almost no systematic evidence of success to support its use. Indeed, the problems of private sector PFP were diffused to the public sector. This case study underscores the lack of evidence-based decision making on an important presidential human management agenda, demonstrates an example of policy adoption based on myth rather than fact and concludes that better human resource management theories built on assumptions and public service motivation pertinent to the public sector are needed. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

More specifically, how can qualitative methods address the "twin challenge of interdependence," namely the challenge to identify diffusion, on the one hand, and the challenge to discriminate between mechanisms of diffusion, on the other? I argue, first, that there are three distinct qualitative techniques that can be used, namely cross-case analysis (often based on systematic case selection), within-case process tracing, and counterfactual reasoning. I demonstrate how these techniques can be adapted to the study of policy diffusion. Second, a combination of these methods is the best practice, since they are largely complementary in terms of the twin challenge of diffusion. The discussion draws on numerous illustrations from recent qualitative policy diffusion studies.

In the labor market reform, the government of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) promoted deregulation by establishing cabinet committees, whose members acted as neoliberal policy entrepreneurs by representing employers' interests. In the financial regulatory reform, LDP senior members and financial bureaucrats resisted reform as veto players by informally coordinating with the financial sector. However, market-oriented reforms were eventually introduced by LDP and opposition reformers, whose policy entrepreneurship was crucial to market-oriented institutional change. © 2015 Policy Studies Organization.},

During this debate, the role of neighborhood structure is ignored and the linear assumption is still prevailing in this field. By analyzing the spatial convergence of local vocational education development with data of 31 provinces from 1995 to 2008 in China, we explore the effects of neighborhood interactions on policy diffusion, paying specific attention to the dynamical role of neighborhood structures in policy diffusion. The empirical results clearly indicate that the development of local vocational education systems in China is spatially autocorrelated to the neighboring provinces. Local vocational education systems converge more slowly if a spatially lagged dependent variable is introduced, while they converge faster if a spatially error variable is introduced. The policy transition between neighbors considering their local spatial context is analyzed with Spatial Markov Chain and a fundamental nonlinear connection between neighborhood structure and policy transition is unveiled. Using spatial econometric models, we also find that the socio-spatial diffusion patterns with the social factors such as consumption, urban/rural distribution and occupation serve as barriers to and amplifiers of policy diffusion. These results not only resonate with conventional linear wisdom on policy diffusion but also offer a new nonlinear perspective on socio-spatial patterns of policy diffusion that are clearly embedded within the local neighborhood structures. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Specifically it explores what types of intergovernmental regional alliances exist and to what extent their member countries coordinate their higher education and research policies. The article focuses on six most prominent and most formalized intergovernmental regional alliances: the Benelux, Norden–The Nordic Cooperation, the Visegrád Group, the Franco-German Cooperation, the Western Balkans, and the Baltic Cooperation. There has been much research devoted to study of policy diffusion from the European to the national level, but the intergovernmental regional level has largely been ignored. This article argues that there clearly exists a multi-level governance system in the area of higher education and research, in which regional intergovernmental alliances also perform policy coordination. Therefore, the politics of European higher education policy-making cannot be fully understood by ignoring intergovernmental regional cooperation. © 2018, Hiroshima University,Research Institute for Higher Education,.

They perceive planning as directly connected to the United Nation’s 1992 document, Agenda 21: the Rio Declaration on Development and Environment. The counter-narrative suggests the UN seeks to restrict individual property rights and American sovereignty. Meanwhile, Agenda 21-related planning is favourably considered and practiced worldwide.

This framework, however, is less instructive in explaining the state-by-state configuration of these policies. What explains the wide variation in charter school policy among states? This study addresses this question by introducing the concept of policy regimes. Policy regimes capture dominant and distinct approaches to policy innovations that are informed by common institutional environments among states. This article applies this concept to charter schools by studying state charter school policies and their effects on academic performance. Factor analysis of different charter school policies identifies four unique policy regimes: independence, support, accountability, and mandate. These four regimes are linked to a series of state characteristics. This article then examines the relationships between regime type and charter school performance using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. The results show that regime types are statistically related to charter student achievement in ways that are consistent with each regime’s policy approach. These finding suggest that policy regimes may be important in disentangling the apparent variation in charter school performance. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In addition, we find that political expertise (as captured by legislative professionalism) and policy expertise (as captured by previous youth access policy experiments at the local level) enhance the likelihood of emulating policy successes found in other states. As such, we establish that internal expertise and external learning are complements, rather than substitutes. Copyright © 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

These are the research questions guiding this study on the spread of and subsequent changes to limit values for nitrogen oxide emissions from large combustion plants. By comparing the processes of diffusion and follow-up policy changes, we assess whether and how policy innovations translate into policy making. In so doing, we build on the literature on the determinants of policy diffusion and transfer. We employ original data on instances of policy adoption and policy change in 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over a period of thirty years (1976-2005). The data are analysed using semi-parametric event-history models. Our empirical findings show that both international and domestic factors account for the observed variation in our data regarding both first-time adoptions and post-adoption modifications. The results reveal that the subsequent tightening of emission standards faces greater obstacles than their mere diffusion (i.e., policy adoption). While international factors and supranational integration appear to impede the subsequent tightening of existing policies, international peer pressure is a strong predictor of an on-going regulatory commitment. Overall, adoption and accommodation processes seem to follow distinctive patterns, suggesting that a promising strategy in policy innovation research would involve differentiation between the first-time adoption and subsequent modification of policies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Borrowing from the literature on policy diffusion and ‘smart strategies’ of small European Union member states, we argue that policy diffusion is fostered by structural and agency-related factors. We illustrate our theoretical ideas with a case study on the new Swiss policy on micropollutants in surface waters. Based on a rich set of documents and interviews with key actors, we show that the integration of Switzerland into formal and informal transnational networks fosters the diffusion of its micropollutants policy to other Rhine riparian countries. In addition, we analyse agency-related factors favouring policy diffusion in river basins, such as a country's pioneer role, its expertise, the fact that its policy is in line with general policy goals in other countries and the political acceptance of the policy at home.

For TNCs, however, weak rule of law, poor governance capacity, corruption and gaps in appropriate legislation in developing countries have made the management, enforcement and monitoring of local labour practices problematic, in the process exposing TNCs to reputational risks and potential commercial harm. TNCs have attempted to overcome these constraints by developing corporate responsibility (CR) strategies designed to set in place codes of ethical conduct in the treatment of worker rights while protecting shareholder interests and those of other stakeholders. As this paper explores, TNCs are pursuing the development of regulatory codes that are required to be adopted by their supply chain partners, in the process, setting standards that are diffused to local businesses and organizations and impacting the regulatory structures that govern local business behaviour. As this paper notes, however, this is not a one-way process of norm diffusion but rather a site of norm reciprocity, where local institutions and practices shape the regulatory outcomes that evolve. To this end, the paper examines the interactions between TNCs and other actors (international organizations, the state, civil society and private actors) in norm diffusion, attempting to map and ascertain how reciprocity in norm diffusion shapes norm and institutional outcomes in CR activities. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

A three-stage theory of diffusion is proposed by conducting a process that traces divergence and convergence in the diffusion of performance management in China. When a superior government only has a policy goal, the inferior governments, competing for innovation, will develop divergent policy instruments. When the superior governments policy goal and policy content seem clear, local governments, competing for loyalty or bandwagoning, adjust their diverged policy instruments to converged ones conforming to the superiors policy content. Finally, when the superior government issues a systematic set of policy goals, content, and instruments, it may use coercive power to promote diffusion. In the process, when the contents of diffusion are different, the superior government applies different levels of coercive power, and the mechanisms, characteristics, and outcomes of diffusion also differ. This research claims that in authoritarian China, the superior government, as a third party in the process of policy diffusion, will play a more sophisticated role than is currently expected in the policy diffusion literature. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {This article tries to identify the conditions under which international policy diffusion occurs, focusing on networks among states. In the existing policy diffusion literature, 'networks' have recently attracted the attention of scholars. Using Agent-Based Simulation, we consider the question of whether a new policy diffuses more widely in a community with dense networks or in a community with sparse networks. Our results show that denser networks do not always lead to more diffusion. Moreover, we find that 'network structure', namely whether easily affected states are connected to innovators, greatly determines the outcome of policy diffusion. Conducting a deductive thought-experiment rather than inductive (mainly statistical) analysis, our research presents a counter-intuitive result concerning the effects of network density on policy diffusion. In addition, we make a contribution to the methodology of international relations by attempting to bridge the unit- and system-levels. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Yet this approach to modeling policy diffusion implies assumptions about homogeneity that are often violated in reality, such that the effect of a given variable is constant across policies. We relax this assumption and use Monte Carlo simulations to compare common strategies for modeling heterogeneity, testing these strategies with increasing levels of variance. We find that multilevel models with random coefficients produce the best estimates and are a significant improvement over other models. In addition, we show how modeling similar policies as multilevel structures allows researchers to more precisely explore the theoretical implications of heterogeneity across policies. We provide an empirical example of these modeling approaches with a unique data set of 29 antiabortion policies. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

Is there evidence that policy-related knowledge and ideas in the foreign policy realm are transferred between jurisdictions? This article addresses this question in the context of the relationship between two fraternal social democratic parties – the British Labour Party and the Australian Labor Party. It focuses on the period between 2006 and 2010, which covers Kevin Rudd’s assumption of the Labor leadership and his first term as Prime Minister and the transition from Tony Blair to Gordon Brown in June 2007. Kevin Rudd’s Prime Ministership was terminated in a party room coup in June 2010 while Gordon Brown led the British Labour Party to electoral defeat one month earlier. The article investigates three prominent areas of foreign policy – regional engagement, climate change, and aid and international development – to evaluate the extent of policy transfer and diffusion between the Rudd and Brown Governments. Using the ‘degrees of transfer’ framework outlined by Dolowitz and Marsh, it finds that emulation, policy combinations, and inspiration all featured but that there was scant evidence of complete transfer. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Using data on levels of access to welfare services in the late Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) era (1976-90), I find that bureaucrats across states who are granted high-discretionary authority engage in policy diffusion with one another. Diffusion based on similarity in discretionary authority is more pronounced when bureaucrats possess high compared with no discretion and does not occur when bureaucrats possess low discretion. Moreover, diffusion between high-discretion bureaucrats operates concurrently with geographic- and economicdriven forms of diffusion that have been well documented in the policy diffusion literature. Results demonstrate that a state's choice of how much discretion to give bureaucrats can open or close channels of diffusion that are available to policymakers in that state. © The Author(s) 2013.},

First, in decentralized young democracies such as Indonesia, local government can play an important role in health policy by experimenting with innovative health insurance schemes. Although such activism may widen subnational inequalities, it can also contribute to the adoption of UHC by increasing the salience of health reform and by allowing policy learning. Second, institutional developments such as decentralization and the introduction of local direct elections can have a substantial impact on incentives for political elites to provide broad-based social services. This article discusses the relevance of these findings for the comparative literature on UHC and social policy in low and middle-income countries. © 2017 ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.},

The empirical findings of the spatial regressions clearly indicate that spatial patterns in social spending dynamics are driven by policy diffusion processes. In fact, economic interdependencies define the pathways of diffusion. Trading partners move in the same direction regarding social policy behavior.

This research studies the conditions affecting the adoption of a mandated e-government innovation - 'Basic Registration Addresses and Buildings' (BAG), in Dutch municipalities (N=429) between 2008 and 2011. In contradiction to what theory suggested, a great deal of variation in the timing of adoption was found. The results of Event History Analysis (EHA) show that early adoption of BAG was primarily the result of a municipality's command over resources. More resourceful municipalities, that is, with better past e-government performance, that are better informed, and included in more extensive policy networks were more likely to adopt this innovation relatively early. Of the motivational factors included in our study, the degree of political alignment between the municipal council and national government proved an important factor in the timing of a municipality's adoption. This is a surprising finding, as it is an uncontroversial and technical governance innovation. This research also shows that classical diffusion explanations play a role, even in the case of a mandated innovation for which the time frame, and thus the time to learn from other governments, was relatively short. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

Generally, we find that privately owned organizations are more likely to offer these services when they operate in policy environments with greater publicness.

In Australia, this includes the Hawke–Keating (1983–1996) and Rudd–Gillard (2007–2013) Governments, and in the United Kingdom, the ‘New Labour’ Blair–Brown Governments (1997–2010). We present a comparative political economy of these welfare reforms, one that draws on both the policy transfer and policy diffusion literatures. By the 1980s, both parties faced three problems related to national economic decline, the ideological challenge to Keynesianism, and the decline of the traditional working-class electorate. We argue both parties developed common electoral and governing strategies aimed at winning support for a market-driven social-democratic program. Policy simultaneously compensated voters for market inequalities and deepened market relations. Focusing on how labour governments managed post-industrial change, responded to inequalities, advanced quasi-markets, and negotiated with union partners, we argue these experiments produced increasingly contradictory results that left both parties electorally and ideologically depleted. Despite important similarities, we note differences – starting points, discrete events and institutional variations have mattered to reform paths and their consequences. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {During the past 45 years, nearly 100 national states have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. This global diffusion poses a puzzle since capital punishment has long been accepted as the ultimate criminal sanction and its abolition has often been politically unpopular in many parts of the world. Although the literature has provided several possible explanations, the role of human rights international non-governmental organizations in worldwide death penalty abolition has not yet received sustained analytic attention. This article offers the first such analysis by arguing that human rights international non-governmental organizations empower pro-abolition constituencies and influence governments toward abolition by framing capital punishment as a human rights violation and lobbying parliamentarians to repeal death penalty laws. Event history analyses of 158 national states from 1967 to 2010 offer strong support for the theory. Controlling for regime type, regional demonstration effects, the Council of Europe, and other rival factors, this article finds that human rights international non-governmental organizations’ local engagement has strongly significant positive relationships with complete abolition. This finding is highly robust against control variable bias, endogeneity bias, omitted variable bias, model dependence, and the alternative operationalization of control variables and the dependent variable. Furthermore, the Philippines example demonstrates the theory’s plausibility. It provides process-tracing evidence that through human rights framing and legislative lobbying, the national sections and member organizations of such human rights international non-governmental organizations as Amnesty International, the International Commission of Catholic Prison Pastoral Care, the International Federation of Human Rights, and Caritas Internationalis led Philippine legislators toward complete abolition in 2006. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {Despite many important recent advances in the study of policy diffusion, this research has devoted limited attention to what happens after the adoption decision. This article attempts to fill this gap in diffusion research by examining the adoption and subsequent modification of “Three Strikes and You’re Out” laws in the American states. Its analysis suggests that distinct political forces affected state-level outcomes at these two stages of the policymaking process. The rapid spread of Three Strikes laws in the 1990s seems to have occurred because states with more conservative leanings and higher proportions of African-American residents gravitated to a salient and visible policy. In contrast, the modification of Three Strikes laws appears to have been encouraged by financial necessity and shifting ideological environments but hindered by the mobilization of stakeholders with an interest in preserving the status quo, including private prison operators and prison officer unions. The contrast illustrates the usefulness of treating policy diffusion as a multistage process, and the stakeholder mobilization results provide empirical support for recent theorizing about policy feedback effects. © 2014, The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Actors at the state level in the United States are attentive to the actions of others in their broader political context when enacting policies. For all that is known about the diffusion of policies in a political context, less is understood about why some states ultimately end up with policies that are similar in structure, but vastly different in content. Do the forces that drive states to policy action also shape the content of the enacted policies? Examining the case of renewable energy policy among US states over a fourteen-year period, this paper addresses this question using event history analysis and an original longitudinal data set of state political and economic characteristics. State's energy economy, the presence of Democratic politicians, and environmental movement organizations are found to be important for determining the kind of policy a state ultimately enacts, while regional policy adoption explains why some states choose to enact largely symbolic renewable energy policies. Policy adoption should be conceptualized as a multifaceted process, with different factors acting as the impetus for action and others shaping the content of the policy. Understanding the nuanced roles of state characteristics and policy diffusion in the policy adoption process requires avoiding binary outcomes of passage or inaction in favor of simultaneously examining both policy action and policy content. © The Author 2014.

	abstract = {A comparative approach to studying the spread of policy innovations has recently yielded new and interesting results, as well as theoretical advancements, for policy diffusion research. Specifically, punctuated equilibrium theory has been offered as an explanation for why some policies spread quickly, while others do so normally, and still others are adopted very slowly. Studies of adoption speed, however, currently rely on careful case selection or a dichotomous categorization of adoptions as fast or slow to test why policies diffuse at different speeds. Building on this foundational work, I propose a method for measuring adoption speed as a continuous concept, so that it can be modeled directly as an important outcome of interest to diffusion scholars. I then use the new measure to evaluate how adoption speed varies across time and policy domain. I further demonstrate the utility of the measure as a dependent variable by replicating past results, including the interactive effect of complexity and salience on adoption speed and positive effect of federal incentives, as well as finding preliminary evidence that policy clusters spread more rapidly than the average stand-alone policy. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

The model is tested through analyses of diffusion of spectrum license allocation policies within and between regions. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative comparative case method is used. Cases are developed from secondary data from the European Union and South America, and analyzed at the national and regional levels. Findings: The results suggest: the expected utility model can be used for in-depth qualitative analyses to compare effects of various diffusion mechanisms; diffusion of spectrum license allocation policies at the regional level was more strongly driven by a policy's likely effectiveness, as compared to potential payoffs for policymakers; and conversely, at the national level diffusion was driven by both payoffs for the policymakers and likely policy effectiveness. Originality/value: The two academic contributions of the paper are its expansion of a unified policy diffusion model to simultaneously account for regional and national levels of governance, as well as for technological change and its application in the telecommunications domain. Practical contributions include providing a framework for systematic analysis of a telecommunications policy's benefits for the public as well as policymakers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This study asks to what extent this increase is explained by demographic factors, national-level economic and political factors, and processes of international diffusion and changing international norms. Analyses integrate the world polity literature on global policy diffusion with a social problems approach to examine international diffusion of state concern among more powerful members of the world polity, a process that can produce changes in international policy consensus. Comparisons of the characteristics of states that do and do not express concern over low fertility find that among wealthier "first-world" countries, state concern has become more responsive to fertility rates: fertility rates are not significantly associated with concern early in the study period, but are strongly associated with concern later in the study period. There is no evidence that integration into the world polity is associated with concern in these countries, and some evidence that less integrated countries are more likely to express concern, suggesting that processes shaping the diffusion of state concern may differ from those identified as shaping policy diffusion in the existing literature. Among "second-world" former Eastern bloc countries, different patterns of associations reflect different political histories: concern is associated only with demographic factors, with no significant change in this association over time. © The Author 2015.},

While these processes imply dynamic connections among political actors, researchers often cannot observe such interdependence. One example is public policy diffusion, which has long been a focus of multiple subfields. In the American state politics context, diffusion is commonly conceptualized as a dyadic process whereby states adopt policies (in part) because other states have adopted them. This implies a policy diffusion network connecting the states. Using a dataset of 187 policies, we introduce and apply an algorithm that infers this network from persistent diffusion patterns. The results contribute to knowledge on state policy diffusion in several respects. Additionally, in introducing network inference to political science, we provide scholars across the discipline with a general framework for empirically recovering the latent and dynamic interdependence among political actors. © 2015 American Political Science Association.},

Recent evidence suggests there is a positive ex ante effect of US labor provisions as PTA partners improve their labor conditions prior to signing an agreement to satisfy the US constituent preferences. Building on this scholarship, we argue that the effect of EU standards will also be positive but exhibited ex post as a result of learning by civil society actors during the implementation phase of labor provisions.

This is surprising given the potential economic (public procurement accounts for some 8% of GDP) and signaling (transparency, good governance) gains of adopting regimes that promote competition in public procurement markets. The article first provides an introduction to the issue of public procurement and discusses the nature of procurement regimes, the dependent variable. It then assesses the impact of key variables identified in the literature on policy diffusion, such as competition, coercion and norm emulation. It is argued that issue linkage in bilateral free trade agreements (FTA) appears to have brought about common laws-and in some cases-rules for procurement. But this stops short of a genuine diffusion of liberal procurement regimes due to negotiations being framed by reciprocity rather than efficiency considerations, the costs and complexity of implementation, as well as opposition from vested sector interests and politicians at all levels of government favoring the short term political utility of 'buy local' policies. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

	abstract = {Organic food certification policy and programs are an interesting case to explore in terms of policy diffusion, as there has been interesting dynamics between the federal and state levels, and great diversity in the pace of diffusion across states. At the same time, this policy diffusion underlies a very dynamic marketplace that has relied on government-based certification policies and programs to stabilize and support growth of the organic food sector. The focus of this paper is a cross-section time series analysis of organic policy adoptions over the past several decades to explore the types of factors that have influenced diffusion across time and space. Although federal policy activity has been a key driver of this dynamic, there are several other state-specific factors that also help to explain the differential diffusion of policies in this realm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Drawing on the concepts of external governance and international policy diffusion, the article takes the enactment of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) as a case study to scrutinize the various channels through which emerging competition policy regimes have been shaped. It first illustrates the limits of recent research suggesting that the AML is essentially the product of EU competition rule export. Recognizing the specific features of China’s competition regime, we then investigate the domestically driven process of inspiration from abroad and customization to domestic conditions. By highlighting the diversity of sources in domestically driven rule selection, the article makes a first step towards capturing the complex diffusion process in international competition policy. © 2017 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.},

Our two experiments–embedded in national surveys of U.S. municipal officials–expose local policymakers to vignettes describing the zoning and home foreclosure policies of other cities, offering opportunities to learn more. We find that: (1) policymakers who are ideologically predisposed against the described policy are relatively unwilling to learn from others, but (2) such ideological biases can be overcome with an emphasis on the policy's success or on its adoption by co-partisans in other communities. We also find a similar partisan-based bias among traditional ideological supporters, who are less willing to learn from those in the opposing party. The experimental approach offered here provides numerous new opportunities for scholars of policy diffusion. ©2015, Midwest Political Science Association},

	abstract = {Within the past 25 years, climate change has evolved from an issue of interest primarily to some natural scientists into one of the top priorities on the global policy agenda. Research in political science and related fields offers systematic and empirically well-supported explanations for why solving the climate problem has turned out to be more difficult than originally anticipated. After reviewing this research, I focus on four areas in which we know less: (a) institutional design features that may help in mitigating or overcoming fundamental problems in the global cooperative effort; (b) factors that are driving variation in climate policies at national and subnational levels; (c) driving forces of climate policy beyond the state, in particular civil society, the science - policy interface, and public opinion; and (d) sociopolitical consequences of failing to avoid major climatic changes. The article concludes by identifying key questions at the micro, meso, and macro levels that should be addressed by political scientists in the coming years. In view of the fact that governance efforts at the global level are progressing very slowly, greater attention to bottom-up dynamics appears useful, both for analytical reasons (there is lots of variation to be explained) and for normative reasons.

In this article, we propose a novel approach to efficiently investigate over 2100 IIAs and their 24,000 articles in unprecedented detail by treating treaty text as data. Our suggested metric yields new and surprising insights about the IIA universe at four different levels. First, at the global level, we use our approach to investigate the effect of asymmetries on negotiation outcomes finding that developed countries tend to be the IIA system's rule-makers, while developing countries tend to be its rule-takers. Second, on the country level, our method can trace consistency and legal innovation in national treaty networks uncovering hitherto unknown investment policy changes such as the Finnish shift to a pre-establishment template in 1999. Third, on the inter-treaty level, our metric can detect investment policy diffusion highlighting that Israel, for instance, copied its bilateral investment treaty (BIT) language from British investment agreements. Finally, on the individual treaty level, our approach enables us to assess the novelty of newly concluded agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, by relating them to prior practice. Our metric thus provides researchers, practitioners and policy-makers with a powerful novel tool to analyze the IIA universe. © 2016 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press.

In addition to shaping, guiding, and influencing norms and approaches to transplantation, the epistemic community has been instrumental in the development of various resolutions, policy initiatives, recommended practices, statements, legislation, and model laws. Moreover, the epistemic community helped position the organ trade as an issue of societal and global importance, and it persistently encouraged states to undertake actions, such as implementing legislation, to combat the organ trade. Critically, the epistemic community's efforts against the organ trade incorporated the concepts of human rights, integrity, and dignity, which had diffused globally and become institutionalized in the period after WWII. © 2016 by the author.},

Contrary to the usual setting with simultaneous decision-making, we consider the impact of sequential decision-making: In the first step, the domestic government introduces an emission tax; in the second step, policy diffusion occurs with a certain probability; and in the third step, the firms decide on output quantities. Within this framework, we analyze how the prospect of policy diffusion, motivated by a higher damage parameter in the domestic country, influences the optimal domestic emission tax. We show that if the damage parameter in the foreign country is sufficiently high, policy diffusion will occur which leads to higher tax rates and higher welfare compared to the equilibrium resulting from simultaneous decision-making. Moreover, we show that an increase in the domestic tax rate also increases the probability that the foreign country adopts the tax policy. © 2013 Springer Japan.},

In spite of extensive research on policy diffusion and learning, there is still a lack of studies on how success relates to learning patterns. We address this deficiency by examining which other governments local administrative units draw lessons from. More precisely, we investigate whether public managers learn from the experiences of local governments whose citizens are satisfied with government services. Using a large dyadic dataset on all Swedish municipalities from 2010, we find that senior public managers in local administrations learn from similar local governments and from neighbours. But we also find clear evidence that they learn from local governments whose citizens are pleased with local public services. This indicates that best practices are spread among local governments. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Historically, quantitative research on global trends has focused on a single policy dimension, potentially masking the unique factors that affect the diffusion of each policy dimension independently. Using an ordered-probit model to analyze new human trafficking policy data on national prosecution, prevention, and victim-protection efforts, we find that global ties and domestic interest groups matter more where international law is less defined. Although prosecution, mandated by the Trafficking Protocol, was relatively impervious to global ties and domestic interest groups, both trafficking prevention and victim protection were associated with these factors. Our findings also suggest that fear of repercussions is not a major driver of state actions to combat trafficking-neither ratification of the protocol nor levels of US aid were associated with greater implementation of antitrafficking measures. © 2015 American Bar Foundation.},

The charge is that in trying to increase international legitimacy, governments copy institutional forms that are not suited to the local context. Yet, such mimicry is not the only driver of international policy diffusion. Domestic policy entrepreneurs learn from experiences of other countries and invoke global norms and values in advancing their preferred policy options. Pressures for mimicry can help such policy entrepreneurs counter resistance from domestic elites, especially in the case of value-based policies, such as transparency and anti-corruption policies. The cases of the Freedom of Information Act and the Asset Disclosure Laws in Romania are used to illustrate how external pressure for legitimacy can empower domestic policy entrepreneurs and facilitate a process akin to “problem-driven iterative adaptation” advocated by critics of isomorphic mimicry in public sector reform.

While sociological understanding of "the global" has become increasingly rich, stressing the complex relationship between material and cultural pressures, an undertheorized nation state often sits on the receiving end of the sociologist's model of globalization. The goal of this article is to help move the sociology of globalization out of the analytical trap of global-national dualism by developing an account of the transnationalization of political authority. Building on neo-Marxist and Weberian theories of the transnational, or global state, which explicate the macro-structural dynamics that have led to the transnationalization of the state as such, I look at the process of the transnationalization of political authority from an institutional perspective, one that focuses on processes of transnationalization within, and across, specific state agencies. These theoretical points are empirically motivated through an historical investigation of the transnationalization of monetary authority and its relationship to the international diffusion of policies of austerity from the era of the classical gold standard through the economic crisis of 2008. © American Sociological Association 2013.},

Using a qualitative research to study Ghana’s adoption of the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), this article brings new evidence to light on how TNAs influence social policies in developing countries. Contrary to arguments that stress imposition as the main policy diffusion mechanism, it is shown here that TNAs combine multiple strategies including ideational, institutional, and material incentives to influence social policies in particular countries. As idea purveyors at the transnational level, TNAs are linked to the national policy process through their connections with policymakers and, more specifically, through policy discussions at regular sector working group meetings. From this perspective, ideas are shared and availability of support toward policy development is communicated. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

Country representatives engage in workshops and roundtables to showcase their mitigation plans and low carbon development initiatives, thereby raising ambitions and creating group pressure on other countries. This article examines how the diffusion of policies across countries is motivated and facilitated by knowledge transfer and learning within multilevel-reinforcing governance dynamics between the domestic level and international negotiations. It analyzes how changes in the negotiation setting from confrontational formal negotiations to a more open forum and bottom-up pledge-and-review process, in combination with a positively framed win–win low carbon economic development narrative resulted in the diffusion of climate policies across developed and developing countries. Communicating these climate initiatives on the national level has shifted the debate. Countries emphasize less the win–lose perspective of economic costs and sacrifice. Thus, they focus less on the question of who should reduce emissions’, but identify co-benefits instead. The institutionalized knowledge sharing within the UNFCCC is also creating positive competitive dynamics among countries to increase their ambition and to take on a leadership role. This shift in the negotiations carries potential for a more ambitious aggregate negotiation outcome and opens up a window of opportunity. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

A broad view of environmentalist reform in Latin America easily reads as top-down diffusion of blueprints and institutional convergence. But such a thesis is reductionist and ultimately misleading, case studies demonstrate. First, diffusion mechanisms matter for divergence: when normative and mimetic mechanisms are relatively strong vis-à-vis coercive forces, formal state change is followed by more meaningful real state change; when the coercive mechanism rules unmatched, green state change ends up being formal for the most part. Secondly, institutional entrepreneurs face shifting opportunity structures for political change; because these opportunities are never uniform, national experiences will differ. Thirdly, national institutional environments provide contrasting domestic resources and cultures for the building of green states; legacy, in short, will condition translation by entrepreneurs. A bridging institutionalist framework helps us make sense of "converging divergence". © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {This article is concerned with the question of why lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) rights legislation is introduced at higher levels in some cases and less so in others. To address this puzzle, the article analyzes changes in LGBT rights legislation across European Union (EU) member states between 1970 and 2009. It focuses on the diffusion of five different categories of such legislation (anti-discrimination, criminal law, partnership, parenting rights, and equal sexual offenses provisions) to new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe, compared with diffusion patterns in older EU member states. I argue that new-adopter states are more dependent on international resources for making new issues visible and are more inclined to see policy adoption as a means to gain external legitimacy and improve reputation. The analysis reveals that the transnational embeddedness of a state’s LGBT advocacy organizations is a powerful statistical explanation for successful policy diffusion to new EU member states, alongside international channels that lead to LGBT visibility among society and state authorities. In addition to lending cross-national, empirical reinforcement to some of the theoretical expectations regarding the international sources of diffusion, the results suggest variability in the determinants of LGBT policy adoption between the 15 old and 12 new EU states. Domestic factors, particularly economic modernization, are more relevant for policy adoption in the older member states, whereas the newer member states display greater dependence on transnational actors and are more influenced by international channels. © The Author(s) 2014},

Unlike previous liberalizing reforms, these second-generation reforms spread without direct or indirect EU pressure. Rather, policy entrepreneurs in both instances succeeded in arguing that these reforms would serve to make former communist economies more competitive in a highly integrated global economy. Yet the policy network advocating pension privatization, centered around the World Bank, commanded far greater resources than the network of right-wing think tanks supporting the flat tax. To what extent did these superior resources matter? This article concludes that resources may accelerate the diffusion of policy ideas and encourage their adoption in larger states, but policy networks armed with ideas can nonetheless spread reforms quickly in competitive environments even in the absence of significant financial resources or membership conditionalities. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Paradoxically, first the explicit and later more implicit rejection of the Western welfare state, including the social-democratic and various "third way" models, eventually led to the rise of neoliberal and anti-welfare attitudes among many Eastern social policy reformers during the last decade of communist rule and beyond, after 1989. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

A growing number of member states and regions within the member states oppose the EU’s agro-biotechnology policy, resulting in a complex multi-level structure of policy-making. This study is interested in the regional opposition to GMOs and scrutinises the determinants of membership in the European Network of GMO-free Regions. In terms of theory, this study builds on the literature of policy diffusion. For the analytical purpose, we distinguish among four diffusion mechanisms: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate regions, imitation of economically powerful regions and deviation from national law. Our research questions are the following: How has membership developed since the foundation of the network? Which mechanisms explain the diffusion patterns observed? The empirical findings show that membership in the network has grown substantially between 2003 and 2014, which supports the general expectation that there is a diffusion of GMO-free regions. Yet, most new member regions are located in the same member states as the regions that founded the network. In other words, what is observed is intra-country diffusion rather than inter-country diffusion. The empirical findings provide support for the importance of learning from earlier adopters for the growing of the European Network of GMO-free Regions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

The UK as an established power and as a member of the European Union appears keen to play a leadership role in climate cooperation, both within the EU and at the multilateral level. However, as in other areas of international politics, emerging countries are becoming increasingly important players for dealing with climate change. In this sense, leadership on the part of the UK would require some constructive engagement of these countries. The article looks at how the UK engages emerging countries, both on its own and in coordination with its EU partners. It addresses both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy efforts. It argues that although the UK is making an effort to engage emerging countries, these efforts are still at an early stage, and they also suffer from a lack of resources and strategic direction. Some policy diffusion is observed in relation to China, but this has not translated to the convergence of positions in climate negotiations. The article concludes that the possibility of influence is constrained by limited resources and the degree of coincidence of interests between the UK/EU and emerging countries. © 2015 University of Kent.},

We propose how eco-innovation can be framed within an integrated MLP-lead market approach.

The use of indicators for lead market factors for empirically analysing the opportunities for system transformation in the MLP framework is assessed.

This convergence in instrument choice is examined in two cases: the emergence of the EU Emission Trading Scheme, i.e. the import of quantity regulation to the EU; and the creation of California’s feed-in tariff, i.e. the import of price regulation to the US. Increasing convergence in instrument choice is the result of international diffusion through learning and shifting domestic coalitions. This demonstrates that the two varieties of market-based environmental policy increasingly blend, and how policy import is driven by domestic government–producer coalitions rather than by policy-maker ideas of ‘best practice.’ © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It first outlines basic concepts and typologies related to sending country policies, focusing particularly on key countries of origin of migrants settled within the European Union. Second, the chapter reviews central explanations for the emergence of sending country policies. However, sending countries do not reach out to their emigrants in equal measure. Differences are therefore examined in the outreach policies of sending countries and in sending countries’ transnational relations with diasporas. The last part of the chapter discusses the nexus between sending country policies and migrant integration in the country of residence. On the basis of existing research, the chapter argues that sending country policies may intersect with migrants' integration in a number of ways. For example, migrant sending countries may seek to strengthen the upward mobility of their expatriate citizens in their place of residence abroad, and they may call for greater protection of migrant workers in precarious labour situations. Little is currently known about how migrants and diasporas respond to these policies and how they are perceived by political actors of countries of residence. This is an area for further study. More analysis is also needed to determine the extent that sending country outreach policies aimed at bonding with and supporting citizens abroad challenge territorial policy sovereignty and the strength of receiving countries in agenda-setting in international cooperation on migration and migrant settlement. © The Author(s) 2016.},

The findings demonstrate that the level of cooperation is not autocorrelated with neighbouring districts, and that there are limited examples of competition.

	abstract = {Since the late 1990s, Congress and the states have debated how to treat electronic commerce for purposes of sales taxation. Frustrated by their limited progress at the national level, advocates of policy change attempted to generate vertical diffusion by using increasingly aggressive state-level actions to press Congress to act. The state initiatives provided national legislators with an “opportunity to learn,” and a systematic analysis of congressional policymaking suggests that vertical diffusion affected the early stages of the legislative process. State policies influenced the specific options that national officials considered, the rhetoric they employed, and, less consistently, bill cosponsorship patterns. The impact of vertical diffusion receded, however, as the congressional debate continued. Its muted effect during the later stages of the legislative process implies that national officials do not necessarily learn from what occurs in the “laboratories of democracy.” In addition to shedding light on the shifting politics of electronic commerce, this study illustrates the benefits both of studying the impact of vertical diffusion on individual decision-making and of conceptualizing vertical diffusion as a process rather than as an outcome to be explained. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {Why do some countries adopt exogenous rules into their domestic law when those rules contravene their specific interests? We draw on the policy-diffusion literature to identify four causal mechanisms that we hypothesize explain the adoption of such rules. While existing literature treats these mechanisms as independent, we argue that each works in combination with the others to facilitate legal transplantation. While one mechanism-coercion-tends to initiate the transplantation process, it fades over time and three others largely supplant it: contractualization, socialization, and regulatory competition. These mechanisms act in a mutually supportive manner. We test our claims via a quantitative analysis of legal transplants in the field of intellectual property (IP) that incorporates an original index of IP protection in 121 developing countries over more than 14 years. This article concludes with a plea for theoretical eclecticism, acknowledging multicausality and context-conditionality. Any comprehensive explanation of legal transplantation must include the identification of mutual reinforcement between causal mechanisms, rather than simply rank their relative contributions. © 2014 International Studies Association.},

Yet the recent 'spatial turn' in comparative politics has also influenced welfare state research. For some years now, the field has been witnessing a growing interest in questions about interdependencies and policy diffusion between countries. In this article, we provide a structured overview of the state of the art in the policy diffusion and transfer literature that deals specifically with social policy. We present and critically evaluate existing theoretical concepts and quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches that enable the analysis of interdependencies between countries. Moreover, we summarize the empirical findings of quantitative and qualitative studies on the diffusion and transfer of social policy, from some pioneering studies to the latest findings. Against this background we point out what we believe to be promising avenues for future research. We focus on five areas: theoretical work on the mechanisms underlying diffusion and transfer; methodological approaches; the impact of domestic institutions and policy characteristics on social policy diffusion and transfer; programme-specific dynamics; and the systematic combination of horizontal and vertical interdependencies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of the current study is to determine what factors have been associated with the global adoption of mandatory child restraint laws (ChRLs) since 1975. Methods: In order to determine what factors explained the global adoption of mandatory ChRLs, Weibull models were analyzed. To carry out this analysis, 170 countries were considered and the time risk corresponded to 5,146 observations for the period 1957–2013. The dependent variable was first time to adopt a ChRL. Independent variables representing global factors were the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank's (WB) road safety global campaign; the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic; and the United Nation's (UN) 1958 Vehicle Agreement. Independent variables representing regional factors were the creation of the European Transport Safety Council and being a Commonwealth country. Independent variables representing national factors were population; gross domestic product (GDP) per capita; political violence; existence of road safety nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); and existence of road safety agencies. Urbanization served as a control variable. To examine regional dynamics, Weibull models for Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Commonwealth were also carried out. Results: Empirical estimates from full Weibull models suggest that 2 global factors and 2 national factors are significantly associated with the adoption of this measure. The global factors explaining adoption are the WHO and WB's road safety global campaign implemented after 2004 (P <.01), and the UN's 1958 Vehicle Agreement (P <.001). National factors were GDP (P <.01) and existence of road safety agencies (P <.05). The time parameter ρ for the full Weibull model was 1.425 (P <.001), suggesting that the likelihood of ChRL adoption increased over the observed period of time, confirming that the diffusion of this policy was global. Regional analysis showed that the UN's Convention on Road Traffic was significant in Asia, the creation of the European Transport Safety Council was significant in Europe and North America, and the global campaign was in Africa. In Commonwealth and European and North American countries, the existence of road safety agencies was also positively associated with ChRL adoption. Conclusions: Results of the world models suggest that the WHO and WB's global road safety campaign was effective in disseminating ChRLs after 2004. Furthermore, regions such as Asia and Europe and North America were early adopters since specific regional and national characteristics anticipated the introduction of this policy before 2004. In this particular case, the creation of the European Transport Safety Council was fundamental in promoting ChRLs. Thus, in order to introduce conditions to more rapidly diffuse road safety measures across lagging regions, the maintenance of global efforts and the creation of road safety regional organizations should be encouraged. Lastly, the case of ChRL convergence illustrates how mechanisms of global and regional diffusion need to be analytically differentiated in order better to assess the process of policy diffusion. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

There has been an extensive discussion of causes and effects of policy diffusion for democracies, but the literature on autocracies lacks similar focus and scope. Similarly, research on the patterns and causes of policies’ diffusion across regime types is virtually non-existent. After some theoretical considerations about regime effects on diffusion in the first part of this paper, we analyse data on foreign trade regulations and nuclear power plants and compare results across regime types. Based on cross-time cross-section regression models, we can show that, depending on the specific policy field, regime type is of less importance for diffusion processes than theoretically expected. This highlights a need for further detailed research on the general role of regime type regarding policy diffusion. © 2016 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, measures have been taken to ban the use of international legal principles in state courts. While these international laws vary in terms of the specific restrictions they place on state legal practices, many of these laws have been aimed implicitly or explicitly at banning Sharia law practices. While dozens of states have attempted to pass anti-Sharia policies, thus far, only eight have been successful. In this article, we apply a policy diffusion framework to help explain the agenda placement and adoption of these measures. We find that both internal state determinants and external regional diffusion factors influence the interstate agenda placement and adoption of anti-Sharia practices. However, the regional effect is negative, meaning that these policies follow an atypical diffusion pattern. This study adds to the growing body of literature that examines the diffusion of controversial morality policies. © 2016 Religion and Politics Section of the American Political Science Association.},

However, in many countries, domestic industries compete fiercely for domestic market share with imports from other countries. Such import competition creates policy diffusion between a country and its import-competitor countries. Such policy diffusion can be observed in policy areas that affect production costs of domestic industries. We focus on import competition’s effect on social welfare policies in developing countries and test our theory in two broad types of policies: social insurance spending and progressive social spending. We find strong evidence for import-competition-induced policy diffusion in both policy areas. Moreover, in the case of social insurance, the effect of policy diffusion is mediated by the strength of labor, suggesting that strong labor is more capable of blocking welfare retrenchment policies. © 2015 SAGE Publications.},

The impact and durability of such measures are contested and the research findings are mixed. This article examines the Tempus program, a core neighborhood policy instrument the EU has used to promote public management reforms. Tempus is the oldest and most dominant instrument to modernize higher education in central and east European countries. It promotes the adoption of key managerial reforms elements. Drawing of these perspectives on policy diffusion, we analyze the relative impact of the program. Based on data from over 50 Western Balkan universities, we compare institutions deeply involved in the Tempus program and those minimally involved or non-affiliated with Tempus. Results show that Tempus projects had minimal direct effects in terms on adoption of public management reforms in the region. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

To interpret this paradox, we discuss: (1) how Toronto is a node in a global education policy network, particularly as an exporter of equity-oriented reforms; (2) how the city’s own school system reflects ongoing tensions between forward-looking ideals and its own historical legacies; and (3) how goals of integration are being challenged by new pressures for educational differentiation, which are themselves driven by competing conceptions of multiculturalism and movements for school choice. © 2016 Hamlin and Davies.},

We hypothesized that communication between tobacco control advocates on GLOBALink, a 7000-member online communication forum in existence from 1992 to 2012, would be associated with the timing of treaty ratification. We further hypothesized dynamic network influences such that external influence decreased over time, internal influence increased over time, and the role of opinion leader countries varied over time. In addition we develop two concepts: Susceptibility and influence that uncover the micro-level dynamics of network influence. Statistical analyses lend support to the influence of co-subscriptions on GLOBALink providing a conduit for inter-country influences on treaty ratification and some support for the dynamic hypotheses. Analyses of susceptibility and infection indicated particularly influential countries. These results have implications for the study of policy diffusion as well as dynamic models of behavior change. © 2015 The Authors.},

This was a period when, owing to the process of social and political transition, the dynamic of policy formation was particularly strong. The research model is based on the theory of policy learning and policy diffusion and incorporates a review of the existing body of research on policy learning in other transition countries and in Slovenia. To identify the presence of policy learning, we used indicators of instrumental, social and political learning. Our main hypothesis, namely, that policy learning was not the trigger of policy change, was tested by applying the following mechanisms of policy diffusion: emulation, coercion and economic competition. We demonstrated the presence of political learning which led to changes in hunting rights, corresponding to the concept of institutional adjustment or patching. Instrumental and social learning were not detected, nor were mechanisms of policy diffusion.},

The results suggest temporary and partial, rather than enduring and substantial, environmental policy integration (EPI). In 2005 the main challenges were to allocate support, focus and prioritise beyond the national policy rhetoric of regional sustainable development, to identify regional applications beyond singular 'pockets of good practice' and to spread ownership and engagement for EPI from specific ambassadors to organisational mainstreaming. In 2011 we found evidence of a more mainstreamed approach of regional sustainable development, but with new challenges of policy diffusion and sectorisation as well as a strong sense of projectification. There is a need to develop arenas and processes for inter-sectoral exchange, interaction and learning to achieve a more systematic change - which is, in essence, what policy integration is all about. © 2013 © 2013 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.},

	abstract = {Background/Context: Performance funding finances public higher education institutions based on outcomes such as retention, course and degree completion, and job placement rather than inputs such as enrollments. One of the mysteries of state performance funding for higher education is that despite great interest in it for over 30 years, only half of all states have ever adopted it. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study examines the political forces that have driven the development of performance funding in some states but not others. To do this, the authors draw on theories of policy origins such as the advocacy coalition framework, the policy entrepreneurship perspective, and policy diffusion theory. Research Design: This study contrasts the experiences of six states that established performance funding for higher education (Florida, Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Washington) and two that have not (California and Nevada). These states differ considerably in their performance funding programs, higher education governance arrangements, and political and socioeconomic characteristics. Data Collection and Analysis: Our study is qualitative, drawing on documentary records and extensive interviews with higher education officials, legislators and staff, governors and advisors, business leaders, and other actors. Findings and Results: Our study finds that many of the actors and motives cited by the prevailing perspective on the origins of performance funding did operate in the six states that have established performance funding, including state legislators (particularly Republicans), governors, and business people pursuing performance funding in the name of greater effectiveness and efficiency for higher education. However, the prevailing perspective misses the major role of state higher education coordinating boards and individual higher education institutions (particularly community colleges) that pursued performance funding to secure new funds in an era of greater tax resistance and criticism of higher education. Our findings further move beyond the prevailing explanation by examining how policy entrepreneurs mobilized support for performance funding by finding ideological common ground among different groups, identifying policies that those groups could support, and taking advantage of political openings to put performance funding onto the decision agenda of state elected officials. Conclusions and Recommendations: This examination of the origins of performance funding policies sheds light on factors that facilitate and frustrate the development of such policies. For example, our research highlights the important role of higher education opposition and the presence of certain political structures and political values in frustrating the development of performance funding. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.},

	abstract = {Previous studies identified several determinants that help explain candidate states’ compliance with EU accession conditionality. However, one influence has largely been neglected so far: states’ spatial dependency. Is it possible to observe diffusion to the extent that states’ interlinkages allow their compliance with the acquis communautaire to be assessed? Are candidate states more – or perhaps even less – likely to comply with EU law when other candidates do? The paper seeks to address these questions. By building on existing research on policy diffusion, it develops a theoretical framework for studying candidates’ compliance with EU law over the accession process according to their spatial dependence. The theoretical argument focuses on ‘competitive learning’ and is tested with quantitative data. The results suggest that candidates’ levels of compliance are indeed driven by spatial interlinkages; however, free riding seems more prevalent than enhanced compliance. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

We find program enactments were driven by rising unemployment and national but not bordering state imitation. Falling unemployment and national trends drove subsequent terminations, but in many states, their impact was overwhelmed by the influence of incentive spending, which greatly reduced termination likelihood. These results not only shed light on policy enactments and terminations in general, but also inform scholarship on state tax incentives and the role of competitive factors in their creation and repeal—or lack thereof. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

Due to this, the policy on immigrants has evolved from earlier forms focusing on regulating immigration based on discrimination and exclusion, to integration and assimilation policies supporting multiculturalism. There are previous studies on immigrant policies and literature reviews both at home and abroad, but the factors that impact on policy diffusion have not been fully analyzed in Korea. This study reviews multicultural family support policies adopted by 153 local governments from 2007 to November 2012, and analyzes the impact of internal determinants which include financial and economic factors, consisting of self-generated revenue, per capita self-generated income, percentage of social welfare budget and urbanization, social and cultural factors including percentage of foreign population, the number of marriage immigrants and their children and the number of civil society organizations, and political and administrative factors including the political orientation of heads of local governments and city council members, election time and acceptance of policies for foreigners. The results suggest that variables of regional diffusion, per capita self-generated income, spending on social welfare, and the acceptance level of policies for foreigners are most significant, while the numbers of marriage immigrants and their children, the number of civil society organizations, and the heads of governments of local governments political orientation are partially significant. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

This article explores how policy learning contributed to the diffusion of these laws among U.S. states.

We posit that this dynamic is likely attributed to the fact that SYG is a controversial version of a morality policy, and these types of policies may exhibit multiple properties of policy learning theory. In addition, we find that multiple internal determinants including racial context, gun purchase rates, and poverty influence the likelihood of SYG adoption. © 2015 Policy Studies Organization.},

We find that urbanized states are more likely to have complete streets policies. Diffusion of the policy appears weakly associated with adjacency of adopting states.

	abstract = {Food, notably its logistics, security, quality, sustainability and social inclusiveness, is increasingly considered as a crucial element in urban settings, deserving specific institutional and strategic instruments. This is testified by the proliferation of urban food strategies, that is municipal strategic documents that various European cities have adopted during the last decade. This chapter examines the emergence and diffusion of the concept in Europe, contextualizing it in connection with broader thesis on 'alternative' food systems, 'new localism' and 'strategic planning', in order to unpack how the notion has been constructed. The first part of the chapter reviews the existing literature on urban food strategies, by presenting the debate over the definition of the concept and discussing the normative stance of scholars in regard to 'alternative' practices. After providing a working definition of urban food strategies, the second part presents an overview of their diffusion in Europe and briefly maps the historical diffusion of the model since the first appearance in Toronto in 2000. The fast adoption of urban food strategies in different urban contexts suggests the necessity of further investigations on the motivations behind the cities' drive towards food governance. In this sense, the chapter argues in favour of a more cautious assessment of food strategies on behalf of scholars, beyond the positive enthusiasm that has been so far connected to them. In particular, the chapter calls for a critique on the political implications of food strategies, which urgently need to be assessed within strategies of city branding, and to be tested on their actual consequences on urban regeneration and development processes.

Despite a growing interest in the phenomenon, the Islamization of politics in democratizing Muslim-majority countries is rarely understood as a process that unfolds across space and time. Based on an original dataset established during years of field research in Indonesia, this article analyzes the spread of shari'a regulations across the world's largest Muslim-majority democracy since 1998. The article shows that shari'a regulations in Indonesia diffused unevenly across space and time. Explanations put forward in the literature on the diffusion of morality policies in other countries such as geographic proximity, institutions, intergovernmental relations and economic conditions did not explain the patterns in the diffusion of shari'a regulations in Indonesia well. Instead, shari'a regulations in Indonesia were most likely to spread across jurisdictions where local Islamist groups situated outside the party system had an established presence. In short, the Islamization of politics was highly contingent on local conditions. Future research will need to pay more attention to local Islamist activists and networks situated outside formal politics as potential causes for the diffusion of shari'a law in democratizing Muslim-majority countries.},

Although the existing literature presents policy diffusion as a technocratic process where socially optimal policies diffuse, many examples exist where the reverse is true or where the central government sanctioned local innovation but the policy diffuses to other places regardless. The author contends that policy diffusion in authoritarian regimes should be understood as a political process, where local officials serve as policy entrepreneurs, rather than a technocratic one. Subnational officials do not respond uniformly to either incentives from the central government or local pressure, but rather adopt experimental policies as a strategy learned from other successful officials. Policy experimentation has emerged as a strategy for officials desiring either career advancement or security, resulting in an S-shaped curve of policy diffusion characteristic of a learning process whereby a few initially innovate but others quickly adopt the experiment once viewed as successful. © China: An International Journal.},

	abstract = {From 2007 to 2010, there were national Labour governments in Britain and Australia, the longest and only third time this had occurred since the second World War. The period of New Labour was closing in the UK, and in Australia the Rudd government came to power after 11 years in opposition, directly influenced by the, at times, trailblazing UK Labour government. In the domain of social policy, New Labour was a source of policy inspiration and transfer. Specifically, the Rudd/Gillard governments borrowed heavily its ‘social exclusion’ agenda, and also the use of ‘compacts’ with the third sector. This article examines the policy diffusion and transfer between the UK and Australia, and in doing so offers critical insights into the policy transfer literature. The article examines the reasons for the Australian Labor Party's adoption of these policies, and links this to wider dilemmas and identity crisis that are afflicting centre-left governments across the globe. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This study attempts to explain the process by which childbirth support policies have spread among localities over time by addressing two questions: whether interjurisdictional and internal factors of policy diffusion have been at work; and how vertical and horizontal diffusion mechanisms have interactively affected local policy adoptions in the developing country. Empirical findings show that horizontal and vertical mechanisms of diffusion considerably outperform intrajurisdictional factors in spreading childbirth support policies among localities. Furthermore, the vertical influence from the central government has a positive conditional effect that stimulates horizontal interactions among local governments for policy formulation. These findings thus suggest that horizontal interactions among localities can provide an important route for the nationalisation of a domestic social policy in the nascent decentralised system. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Although social assistance has expanded throughout the developing world in the 21st century, the political logic guiding CCT adoption differs sharply from that of unconditional cash transfers, and from the politics of social insurance development. Striking spatial and temporal correlations in their adoption also raise the specter of policy interdependence. A dynamic logit analysis of social assistance reforms in developing nations from 1990 to 2011 reveals that although CCTs have been impelled by democratization in developing countries, the model is not embraced systematically by the left or the right of the political spectrum. Rather, CCTs are more likely to be adopted in contexts of divided government and where regional neighbors, and more democratic countries in the region, have previously adopted them. © 2015 SAGE Publications.},

We disaggregate the makeup of a pivotal state into two main components – capability and credibility – and underscore Japan's significant latent capabilities, but also its serious credibility shortcomings. The TPP's boost to Japan's credibility raised the possibility of significant economic, legal and political externalities for specific countries which responded by accelerating FTA initiatives that had long stalled: the trilateral China–Japan–Korea FTA, a 16-state East Asian FTA and the Japan–European Union trade negotiations. This study extends the theoretical frontier in policy diffusion studies by clarifying the combination of factors that allows some states, but not others, to activate the externalities behind the dissemination of defensive FTAs. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Regional policy regimes, developed in broad social and economic territorial areas, affect the internal transformation of the state. The authors plan to provide comprehensive empirical evidence about the emergence of worldwide regulatory regionalism by identifying how regulatory agencies have diffused very successfully within the regional level in recent decades. The paper aims to identify, using an original methodological design, the ways in which such diffusion of agencies occurred, as this may have theoretical relevance for the study of regulatory regionalism. The authors’ hypothesis suggests that transnational political interactions in each regional cluster triggered agency diffusion, contributing to the development of the regulatory state within the countries of each region. To test this hypothesis, the authors employed a data set of regulatory agencies including the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), and most Asian and Latin American countries (+59) from 1950 to 2007, for 15 sectors related to finance, risks, utility and competition.

Recent work in flagship journals has challenged canonical work by modeling outcome uncertainty as Brownian motion. This theoretical innovation has resonated because it is highly tractable and captures intuitively important realities of many decisions in ways that earlier models cannot. As theoretically attractive as the new models are, they have not yet been evaluated empirically. This is especially important because Brownian motion models place actors in more cognitively demanding situations than previous models. We offer what we believe to be the first experimental test of actors’ ability to behave in ways consistent with the Brownian motion model by evaluating subjects’ ability to rationally learn from another actor’s experiences. We show that subjects adjust their actions in response to the Brownian motion uncertainty. However, they deviate from optimal behavior in important ways, particularly in more complex situations. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.},

First, we present a historical description of how the Directorate of Education and Skills of the OECD has become a central figure in global policy discussions. Then, we address the particular mechanisms through which the OECD is able to expand their influence. We argue that the scientific validation of their recommendations through country reviews and the invitation to participate in large-scale studies and surveys, such as the Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) and the Teaching and Learning Survey (TALIS), have become pivotal for communicating policy messages concerning teacher quality and development. Next, we argue that while OECD recommendations are engrained in notions of human capital, their work on teachers has incorporated elements of professional capital. Additionally, we stress how the influence of social science and large-scale survey studies has contributed to the development of a concept of teacher professionalization promoted by the OECD.

We show how the making of instruments can coincide with the formation of ‘instrument constituencies’, which consist of entangled practices that cultivate an instrument. Constituencies sustain the instrument and are themselves sustained by the instrument as it persists and expands its realm of validity.

Still, the unique role that interest groups play in policy diffusion networks is not fully understood, in large part because the current methodology for studying diffusion cannot parse out interest group influence. We address this problem by analyzing the actual text of legislation, moving away from binary adoption to a more nuanced measure of policy similarity. This allows us to distinguish whether states emulate other states or interest group model legislation. We use text similarity scores in a social network analysis to explore whether early-adopting states or interest groups are more central to the network. We apply this analytical framework to two policies—abortion insurance coverage restrictions and self-defense statutes. Based on this analysis, we find that a fundamentally different picture of policy diffusion networks begins to emerge—one where interest group model legislation plays a central role in the diffusion of innovations. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

Using a unique data set made up of every active teacher collective bargaining agreement in Washington State, the authors estimate spatial lag models to explore the relationship between the restrictiveness of a bargained contract in one district and the restrictiveness of contracts in nearby districts. Employing various measures of geographic and institutional proximity, they find that spatial relationships play a major role in determining bargaining outcomes. These spatial relationships, however, are actually driven by two "institutional bargaining structures": education service districts (ESDs), which support school districts, and UniServ councils, which determine who is bargaining on behalf of local teachers' unions. This finding suggests that the influence of geographic distance found in previous studies of teacher wages may simply reflect the influence of these bargaining structures. © Cornell University 2014.},

It finds that the 2008 constitutional reform at the federal level exerts a strong positive effect (federal mandate); being situated in a neighborhood of states that have reformed has a counterintuitive negative effect (spatial proximity); and having a governor from the same party as governors of other states that have reformed has a positive influence (network affinity).

	abstract = {The process of adopting policy ideas is extremely complex and requires a close examination of the political context in which the idea is learned, articulated, contested, adapted, and accepted by agents, both individual and collective. Why and how was the world's first urban scheme of mandatory reduction of total emissions adopted in Tokyo and not elsewhere? What might cause diffusion of this idea in other urban areas? One key explanation behind the idea adoption is a policy evolution of trial-and-error lessons about effective policy design, desirable policy goals, and politically feasible judgments. This study finds that both agency effects and structural opportunities of policy adoption in the case of Tokyo's cap-and-trade are too specific to result in a more coherent diffusion of ideas, policies, and practices in other urban areas. Although there is a sign of diffusion of Tokyo's cap-and-trade throughout Japan, it is more likely to derive from mimicking behaviors than from learning. The policy transfer of Tokyo's cap-and-trade requires the continuous learning of adaptive capacity to make it better fit to locally specific conditions. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

While a number of studies have considered the reasons for adoption of renewable energy and climate change policies, they typically consider only one policy in isolation. This study examines policy adoption of 14 energy and climate change programs in a pooled event history analysis. Our primary research questions consider average effects of horizontal policy diffusion, while also identifying factors that vary across policy type. We offer a method of testing whether predictors vary across policies and use this test to incorporate interactions by policy in the statistical analysis. Our results indicate that many of the primary drivers of adoption are political in nature, including state ideology, environmental interest group membership, and diffusion via ideologically similar neighbors. In addition, we find that given policy heterogeneity, a number of determinants vary by policy type, though differences are in magnitude rather than direction. © 2016 Policy Studies Organization},

This article examines recent historical scholarship, archival evidence, and information on unemployment compensation programs internationally to situate this policy choice in a wider context. The exclusion of these categories of workers is consistent with the experience of other unemployment insurance programs. Given the close linkages between the technical experts who drafted the US legislation and their counterparts abroad, the exclusion of agricultural workers and domestic servants from unemployment insurance is best understood as an example of policy diffusion. © Social Science History Association, 2016.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study is both empirical and theoretical. It uses data from existing studies and also agencies involved in Bookstart to explain the diffusion of the program. It then draws on theories of policy diffusion and the initial findings of this study to develop an analytical framework for the further study of the diffusion of the Bookstart program. Findings: The Bookstart program, which is designed to promote reading habits for children 0 to 3 years old and to strengthen parent-children relations, was originally initiated in the UK. It was first introduced into Taiwan in Taichung County in 2003. The paper shows how the program spread throughout Taiwan and indicates the role of the key players in the diffusion, including charitable institutions, local politicians and leaders, local authority agencies, and the Ministry of Education. The paper posits an analytical framework identifying factors which may help to promote or facilitate the diffusion. In this respect, the paper draws on the theoretical literature and also initial evidence from the research so far undertaken. This will guide the research in the next stage of the study.

The purpose of our study was to (1) review the diffusion of state policies mandating the provision of tobacco cessation treatment as a condition of state licensure in substance abuse treatment facilities and psychiatric treatment centers and (2) describe the current landscape of policies relating to tobacco cessation in state-licensed substance abuse treatment facilities and psychiatric treatment centers. Findings: We conducted a nationwide assessment of all 50 states from May 2013 - October 2014 to determine the progress each has made with developing a statewide tobacco cessation policy. We reviewed state government websites, conducted phone interviews with state regulatory agencies, and emailed state employees. Overall, 13 of 50 states (26 %) require tobacco cessation provision in alcohol, drug rehabilitation, and or mental health treatment centers, 6 states (12 %) are currently working towards a state policy, and 31 states (62 %) do not require tobacco cessation nor are working towards a state policy, though many of them have smoke free policies in both substance abuse centers and mental health wards. Conclusions: Our updated review of statewide smoking cessation policies in alcoholic, drug abuse, and mental health populations reveals that while clinical findings that affect population health may be well-publicized in the research community, these findings are not necessarily translated into policy. Further research on policy diffusion is needed. © 2015 Krauth and Apollonio.},

In an era of rapid technological change and devolved governance, innovation occurs in policy design and implementation as well as in the more familiar domains associated with new products, processes, materials, and markets. Innovation is a factor in how resilient firms, intermediaries, and supply chains face shifting market conditions and absorb new technology. This chapter describes two key intersections between resilience and innovation: innovative governance characterized by policy diffusion networks, and regional economic ecosystems characterized by open innovation. The discussion of policy diffusion networks is based on an analysis of the scope, character, and geographic distribution of such networks since 2011. The discussion of open innovation and regional economic ecosystems relies on an industry case study of “smart cities” as an enabling industry defined by the integration of information and communications technologies with urban infrastructure deployment. The combination of these two empirical cases of evolving mechanisms of and for technology diffusion into cities-as places and as institutions-highlights the intersections between resilience and innovation. © Nick Williams and Tim Vorley 2017., All rights reserved.},

The article points out that in opposing individualist rational choice theory, sociological institutionalism takes a strong structuralist stance in which actors are depicted as agents constituted by the scripts of rationalist world culture, mindlessly enacting worldwide models. In contrast, discursive institutionalist scholarship focuses on research about the actual practices through which global ideas are incorporated in local contexts, as well as on the discourses that motivate actors in the modern world to behave so uniformly in several ways, even though the culture of modernity specifically celebrates individualism and sovereignty and denounces mindless compliance. These studies have highlighted the key role of local actors in the local-global interaction. Yet these orientations must not be seen as separate schools of thought, but rather as developments within neoinstitutionalist sociology. In other words, recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the forms of local-global interaction. Case analyses have shown that synchronization of national policies seems to be a side effect of local actors utilizing broadly shared ideas and values in justifying their political objectives. © The Author(s) 2015},

For example, Sweden and Botswana, two nations vastly different across multiple dimensions, both liberalized their telecom sectors. Why did so many countries adopt liberal reforms in such a short period of time? Conventional wisdom highlights the role of global markets and technology, powerful states, global diffusion, and domestic politics. I argue that contrary to these claims, diffusion through key international organizations is the critical and overlooked factor in explaining rapid global convergence of pro-market telecom reforms. Using an original dataset for 189 countries between 1970 and 2003 and event history analysis, I demonstrate that membership in key liberal trading organizations, especially the WTO and the OECD, increases the likelihood that countries will adopt liberal pro-market reforms in telecommunications. These results speak directly to current public policy debates about the reregulation of global markets and bridges the literatures of policy diffusion, institutional design, and regulatory regimes. © 2015 Policy Studies Organization.},

A multi-dimensional analysis was used to discover how newspapers reported changes in Queensland's public sector information (PSI) policy to identify whether stories on PSI policy were reframed over time. At a quantitative level, the text analytics software Leximancer was used to identify key concepts, issues and trends in 786 relevant articles from national, metropolitan and regional newspapers. At a qualitative level, discourse analysis was used to identify key themes and patterns from the newspaper articles. Both qualitative and quantitative shifts in the media reporting of Right to Information (RTI) and FOI were revealed across three time periods representing the periods before, during and after the reform implementation. The findings offer insights into the role of newspapers in policy diffusion, revealing how Queensland media reports framed the shift in PSI policy from pull model FOI to push model RTI. © Media International Australia Editorial Board.},

The public-private mix of healthcare financing in National Health Service (NHS) systems led those in the Social Health Insurance (SHI) and Private Health Insurance (PHI) systems in the short and medium-runs, while the public-private mix of healthcare financing in the PHI health care system lagged behind that of the SHI and NHS systems over the period of 1960-2012.

In current debates on explaining reform in 'Bismarckian' social (health) insurance systems, however, these issues have been neglected. In particular, the role of 'negative lesson-drawing' in the sense of avoiding mistakes of others has not often been considered. This article compares health system change in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, three countries with health systems of the social insurance type. In contrast to the existing literature, our analysis stresses that these countries have taken different reform paths since the 1990s. By applying a most similar systems design, we analyze how far cross-border lesson-drawing has contributed to health system divergence in the three countries. The empirical basis of the analysis is semi-structured qualitative expert interviews, a method appropriate for tracing processes of lesson-drawing. We argue that in order to fully understand the diverging reform trajectories, we need to take into account how political decision-makers refer to (negative) experiences of other countries. Generally, national driving forces for health system change were at the heart of many crucial reforms during the period studied. Nevertheless, we claim that it was the German bad practice role model that kept the reform paths of Austria and Germany apart in the Austrian health reform discussion between 2000 and 2005. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Low-emission vehicle (LEV) technologies have grown in the 1990s, but have since experienced fluctuating interest. Initially, electric vehicles (EVs) were the most promising technology. Most large car firms developed EVs and started bringing them to the market, in limited numbers. Yet, car firms halted their EV engagement around 2001 and focused on hybrid vehicles (HVs) and fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) instead. Hybrids found their way into the product portfolios of most car manufacturers while FCVs failed to gain traction. In 2006, car firms again committed to EVs, and on a larger scale. To better understand recurring waves of firms' low-emission-vehicle investments in the international context, this paper explores the influence of geographically-bound government policies on car firms' innovation strategies. An analysis of archival data from 1997 to 2010 details LEV-specific developments per region/firm, and shows the complex interplay between policies on local, national and international levels and firms' strategies. Three mechanisms seem to shape the international LEV trajectory: (1) international policy diffusion (vertically and horizontally), (2) firms' international operations, and (3) fit between policy requirements and firm capabilities. Heeding the call for a better geographical conceptualization of technological trajectories, this paper also proposes a framework that explains co-evolution between government policies and car manufacturers. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

A relatively new and novel way states can reduce DUI deaths from repeat offenders is to require offenders to install an interlock device on their vehicle, but not all states have adopted this measure. We explore whether the Policy Typology and Policy Diffusion Frameworks can help us understand the politics behind why some states have adopted interlock policies while others have not. Employing over-time data from the American states our results suggest that the adoption of interlock laws is best explained by internal factors to the state and the adoption of interlock laws by neighboring states. In addition, the adoption of interlock laws is a form of incremental policymaking—states with existing DUI laws are more likely to adopt interlock policies. We conclude that interlock policies diffuse in a manner similar to other regulatory policies and that interlock policies should be categorized as protective regulatory policies rather than social regulatory policies. © 2015 Policy Studies Organization},

Taken together, this paper suggests that, for certain types of new issue areas, the demographic composition of state legislative chambers and the policy diffusion process are conditional on one another.

The article draws findings and propositions from recent literature to identify the mechanisms at work and the conditions under which they foster mutually beneficial solutions.

	abstract = {The aim of this article is to propose a new analytical framework for comparing and explaining the emergence and diffusion of European regional mountain initiatives (ERMIs), envisaged as 'functional regulatory spaces' (FRS). The article examines three exploratory hypotheses. The first hypothesis considers that the different ERMIs (Alps, Pyrenees, Jura, Carpathian, Balkan Mountains, Dinaric Arc, Caucasus) can be compared, distinguished, and classified using the FRS approach. The second hypothesis addresses the relationship between the degree to which ERMIs correspond to an ideal-type FRS and their role and position within policy diffusion processes. We suggest that the more an ERMI corresponds to an ideal-type FRS, the more important is its role in diffusion processes. The third hypothesis focuses on the relationship between the degree of formalization and institutionalization of ERMIs and their role in policy diffusion processes. We argue that the more and the earlier an ERMI is "formalized" and "institutionalized" in a clear and robust way as a "mature" FRS, the more important its role, and the more central its position, in diffusion processes. This article is a very first attempt to link FRS and policy diffusion concepts. As such it seeks to assess the link's feasibility and relevance, rather than a definitive empirical (in)validation of the three hypotheses. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

High growth rates and technological advances have typically coincided with both strong VC market activity and state support of equity financing. This, however, has not been the case in Vietnam. In this article a policy diffusion framework is used to investigate the international and domestic origins of Vietnam’s nascent VC policies, and how they became part of the agenda of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) as credit-based, rather than equity-based, solutions. The article argues that Vietnam’s heterodox approach to VC policy results from both external forces from donors and from domestic factors. In particular, Vietnamese policymakers have a preference for credit-based SME financing solutions and Vietnam’s official development assistance providers diffuse expertise on loans, not equity investments, to the Socialist Republic. The only donors recommending VC and equity-based financing in Vietnam have gone “around the state” rather than through it by working directly with the private sector. As a result, Vietnam’s SME financing initiatives have significantly diverged from international VC policy patterns. © 2014, © 2014 Asian Studies Association of Australia.},

The simulation can thus compare policy adoption patterns in the presence and absence of policy diffusion within a controlled setting. The simulation makes two propositions. First, it supports the existing critique that relying on the identification of policy clusters can lead researchers to draw false positive conclusions about the relevance of policy diffusion. Second, it suggests that relying on the identification of policy volatility under political stability minimizes this risk. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

	abstract = {This article examines the diffusion of U.S. state child passenger safety laws, analyzing over-time changes and inter-state differences in all identifiable features of laws that plausibly influence crash-related morbidity and mortality. The observed trend shows many states' continuing efforts to update their laws to be consistent with latest motor vehicle safety recommendations, with each state modifying their laws on average 6 times over the 30-year period. However, there has been a considerable time lag in knowledge diffusion and policy adoption. Even though empirical evidence supporting the protective effect of child restraint devices was available in the early 1970s, laws requiring their use were not adopted by all 50 states until 1986. For laws requiring minors to be seated in rear seats, the first state law adoption did not occur until two decades after the evidence became publicly available. As of 2010, only 12 states explicitly required the use of booster seats, 9 for infant seats and 6 for toddler seats. There is also great variation among states in defining the child population to be covered by the laws, the vehicle operators subject to compliance, and the penalties resulting from non-compliance. Some states cover only up to 4-year-olds while others cover children up to age 17. As of 2010, states have as many as 14 exemptions, such as those for non-residents, non-parents, commercial vehicles, large vehicles, or vehicles without seatbelts. Factors such as the complexity of the state of the science, the changing nature of guidelines (from age to height/weight-related criteria), and the absence of coordinated federal actions are potential explanations for the observed patterns. The resulting uneven policy landscape among states suggests a strong need for improved communication among state legislators, public health researchers, advocates and concerned citizen groups to promote more efficient and effective policymaking. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The dominant processes of environmental governance in China take the form of (i) many laws but state planning is dominant and (ii) intermediate crisis scanning procedures and policy responses on an irregular or episodic basis outside the confines of the Five-Year Plans or other national plans. The parallel processes in the US involve (i) law-centered practices including the enactment of legislation, the promulgation of regulations, and the judgments of courts and (ii) federalism/multi-level governance featuring initiatives/innovations at national and sub-national levels of government and policy diffusion. These institutionalized governance processes are more deeply embedded in the political and social systems of the two countries than the range of factors commonly considered in discussions of policy instruments. Both sets of institutionalized governance processes produce successes in addressing environmental problems under some conditions and failures under others. But the determinants of success in the two systems are not the same, and there is no reason to expect the two systems to converge during the foreseeable future.

This study conducts event history analyses using a unique cross-national panel dataset, which spans the time period from 1999-2005. Following the work of Berry and Berry, our event history analyses model both the internal features of each country and the influence that nation-states have on each other with regard to setting tertiary education graduation policy. We find significant influences of both internal determinants and diffusion factors. We find a positive, significant effect of membership in the OECD consistent across both the massified and universal thresholds. We also find a positive, significant effect of having a more stable political system for crossing the 15% threshold. In addition, being located near a pioneering nation, the UK, has a positive, significant effect of crossing the 50% threshold. © 2013 Copyright British Association for International and Comparative Education.},

In this article, we extend this venue of research to explore service termination (i.e., whether to provide). In doing so, we adopt four theoretical strands developed in the fields of public policy and management to guide our research: policy termination, political economy, make-or-buy, and policy diffusion. Methods: We utilize multiple International City/County Management Association surveys for our analysis. We supplement these data with information gleaned from a variety of other sources, including Census data, to construct a binary logistic regression model examining the determinants of service termination. Results: We find that local governments are likely to terminate their services when they were previously outsourced to third-party contractors rather than produced by their own employees. Further, our results indicate that locales tend to drop services more often when they are not commonly provided by peer jurisdictions, supporting the idea of diffusion. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, despite a dearth of research undertaken, service termination is surprisingly common and widespread across service areas. © 2015 Southwestern Social Science Association.},

Without intervention from Ottawa, the provinces have fashioned what amounts to a de facto pan-Canadian system. Learning to School explains how and why the provinces have achieved this unexpected result. Beginning with the earliest provincial education policies and taking readers right up to contemporary policy debates, the book chronicles how, through learning and cooperation, the provinces gradually established a country-wide system of public schooling.

	abstract = {Skyrocketing childhood obesity rates have fueled rising concern about the health of school-aged children around the world. Efforts to reduce childhood obesity have increasingly targeted improvements to school meal programs. In particular, in the United States, the landmark 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) marked the first substantial changes to federal school food policy in recent years to enhance the quality of school meals. Despite these federal policy changes including mandated nutritional improvements and increased federal funding for farm to school programs that can help schools meet the new nutritional standards, there is still significant variation in the prevalence of farm to school programs across the United States. Theories of the policy process suggest that federal policies can vary by state in their implementation and impact, with state-level factors influencing this variation. This paper quantitatively explores the effect of both federal legislation through vertical diffusion and state-level internal determinants on farm to school rates across the country. My findings reveal that state affluence and the average farm to school rate of a state's regional peers emerge as the most significant, positive predictors of state-level farm to school rates. This research sheds light on the current nature of school food programs in the United States that provide critical nutrition to millions of school children each day, and suggests a need for additional research exploring the linkages between federal policy, state-level factors, and local implementation of school food programs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

In the period 2005-2010, the total number of recorded adaptation policy measures in the EU grew by some 635%. Despite the plethora of work on adaptation governance, few if any empirical studies have been conducted that explore the driving forces behind the rapid adoption and diffusion of adaptation policies. Working within the theoretical framework of national policy innovation (see Jordan and Huitema, 2014a,b), we draw on a uniquely systematic database of national climate polices to develop a set of hypotheses on the drivers and barriers surrounding the adoption and diffusion of climate change adaptation policies across 29 European countries. Using an internal/external model we postulate that adaptation is largely being driven by internal factors. Additionally, we look to the possible effects of this policy adoption and diffusion to see if adaptation is emerging into a new and distinct policy field. What we find is that indeed it could be in a handful of countries. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

While adding extensive empirical insights from the status of energy transitions in two countries faced with major energy challenges, the Philippines and Morocco, our contribution enquires what role external actors like international donors in general, and Germany in particular, can play in such transitions. Based on extensive semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews with energy sector stakeholders in the Philippines and Morocco, this article elucidates the opportunities and barriers of supporting and incentivizing energy transitions in developing countries through development cooperation. Taking transition management as an analytical framework to highlight links between niche level experiments and the electricity regime, this study reveals that donors cannot force an energy transition, but can be a driving force for testing alternative ways for electricity supply through niche level experiments and regime level interventions that are closely connected to the country's primary energy objectives. Multi-stakeholder coordination, a clearer linkage between niche level projects and regime changing effects, and a better understanding of a country's energy transition objectives are promising approaches to increase the likelihood of development cooperation positively affecting a regime level shift in the electricity system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

Many observers anticipated that this newfound authority would produce policy diversity, as local governments would tailor programs to constituents' needs. Instead, many municipalities chose to replicate programs made famous elsewhere. What explains this diffusion of social policies across Brazil? In particular, what motivates policy makers to emulate "innovative" policies? This study compares three approaches that seek to explain political behavior: political self-interest, ideology, and socialized norms. It draws on two policies, Bolsa Escola, an education program, and Programa Saúde da Família, a family health program, in four exemplary cities, to uncover the mechanisms that led to diffusion. Surprisingly, political incentives, such as electoral competition, cannot explain diffusion. Rather, ideology and socialized norms, transmitted through social networks, drive policy emulation. Diffusion occurs when politicians are ideologically compelled to replicate these programs and when policy specialists seek to demonstrate that they follow professional norms. © 2008 by the Latin American Studies Association.},

	abstract = {This article builds on the recent policy diffusion literature and attempts to overcome one of its major problems, namely the lack of a coherent theoretical framework. The literature defines policy diffusion as a process where policy choices are interdependent, and identifies several diffusion mechanisms that specify the link between the policy choices of the various actors. As these mechanisms are grounded in different theories, theoretical accounts of diffusion currently have little internal coherence. In this article we put forward an expected-utility model of policy change that is able to subsume all the diffusion mechanisms. We argue that the expected utility of a policy depends on both its effectiveness and the payoffs it yields, and we show that the various diffusion mechanisms operate by altering these two parameters. Each mechanism affects one of the two parameters, and does so in distinct ways. To account for aggregate patterns of diffusion, we embed our model in a simple threshold model of diffusion. Given the high complexity of the process that results, strong analytical conclusions on aggregate patterns cannot be drawn without more extensive analysis which is beyond the scope of this article. However, preliminary considerations indicate that a wide range of diffusion processes may exist and that convergence is only one possible outcome. Copyright © 2006 Sage Publications.},

Yet, the overall level of national pension generosity may differ from the generosity of each important dimension. To improve our understanding of public pension reforms that increase generosity levels, this study examines the introduction of automatic indexation clauses between 1945 and 2000. The paper tests predictions of welfare policy development and policy diffusion theories. Using event history methods, we argue that the inflation rate and the incumbency of Christian democratic parties are the main determinants of these policy reforms. Countries with higher inflation rates and more entrenched Christian democratic parties are more likely to link pensions in payment or past wages considered for initial calculation purposes to an economic index. This suggests that political parties differ in their support for each measure that improves pension generosity depending on its expected redistributive impact. © The Author(s) 2012.},

	abstract = {Quantitative-oriented diffusion studies, either focused on diffusion patterns or mechanisms, take for granted that policy adoptions are manifest and therefore directly observable in the legislation. A more nuanced perspective of policy adoption taking into account gradual differences between adoption and non-adoption is proposed with this paper, valid for diffusion among communities and states in federal settings and among countries on the global level. Besides the aspect of visibility, intentions are also important when measures are adopted. While some measures are transferred with a clear instrumental aim, others are rather transferred for symbolical reasons. Looking at specific processes, the paper proposes a concept that disentangles the current understanding of policy diffusion and provides empirical evidence that current diffusion research misconceives instances. The four different transfer types are illustrated with empirical evidence from sub-national energy policy-making in Switzerland. The systematic investigation of the cases allows to finding explanations for the different transfer types. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {This article discusses current explanations of issues of institutional change and innovation in the global environment, with specific reference to the diffusion of pension-policy paradigms. It argues against explanations which stress unilaterally the role of external actors and shows the limitations of approaches based on diffusion models in which the actor's choice space is not examined. It argues that domestic factors are crucial in determining the outcomes of policy-diffusion processes. Although current policy ideas and models are important, the extent to which they are influential and shape concrete policy choices are primarily determined by domestic political institutions and path-dependent domestic factors. Ideas and policy paradigms provide a possibility set for an institutionally and path-dependent constrained choice. Drawing on a case study of the diffusion of the reform model advocated by the World Bank, the article argues that Brazil's non-reform can be best explained by path dependency and by the "politics of loss imposition" that characterizes pension reform. Brazilian reformers copied a model from an existing policy template, but this emulative behavior can be best viewed as an instance of a path-dependent, constrained, institutional choice, rather than a mimetic behavior associated with a cultural, linguistic, or regional pattern as suggested by strands of the diffusion literature.},

	abstract = {Objectives. This study combines theories on agenda setting, policy innovation, and policy learning to develop an improved model of state policy change. The case of fetal killing policy change in the states is used to develop a model that incorporates national media attention and the decisions of state courts, in addition to policy learning variables that account for the policy changes of neighboring states and the passage of time. Methods. I test the effect of national media attention, decisions by the courts, and the actions of neighboring states on the likelihood that states will change their fetal homicide policies. Using time-series cross-sectional data from 1970 to 2002, the model is tested using logistic regression analysis. In addition to testing the theories mentioned above, control variables in the model include citizen and government ideology and the percentage of state residents who are fundamentalist Protestants. Results. Three of the four research hypotheses are supported by the statistical analysis. The results demonstrate that increased media attention to fetal homicide in a given year increases the likelihood that a state will change its policy the next year. Support is also found for the hypothesis that state court decisions will affect policy change. One of the control variables, government liberalism, is also found to decrease the likelihood that states will change their fetal homicide policies. Conclusions. This study lends insight into why states change their policies by including agenda-setting variables such as media attention and decisions made by the courts. States do react to the actions of the courts by making changes to policies affected by the decisions. © 2009 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.},

Regional authorities have become directly involved in the design and implementation of regional science and technology (S&T) policies. However, the interventions of sub-national governments are much more diverse than the prevailing view about the convergence of regional policies towards innovation policies might imply. This paper describes science, technology and innovation policies adopted by five Spanish regional governments between the mid-1980s and the beginning of the 21st century from a comparative perspective. The paper first describes the policy approaches (academic versus industrial) adopted by the regional authorities. Second, it analyses the explanatory factors in order to reach certain conclusions about the circumstances under which regional governments can implement policies of one or the other approach. Despite the influence of some structural factors, especially as regards initial political preferences, the analysis highlights the relevance of the mobilized interests when they are concentrated in the region, showing that changes in policy orientation are particularly difficult when those interests play a role in the administration of such policies. Preferences towards a policy reorientation are more likely to succeed with the aid of appropriate administrative arrangements, especially along with significant budget increases. © 2005 Regional Studies Association.},

	abstract = {Interpersonal communication presents a methodological challenge and a research opportunity for researchers involved in field experiments. The challenge is that communication among subjects blurs the line between treatment and control conditions. When treatment effects are transmitted from subject to subject, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is violated, and comparison of treatment and control outcomes may provide a biased assessment of the treatment's causal influence. Social scientists are increasingly interested in the substantive phenomena that lead to SUTVA violations, such as communication in advance of an election. Experimental designs that gauge SUTVA violations provide useful insights into the extent and influence of interpersonal communication. This article illustrates the value of one such design, a multilevel experiment in which treatments are randomly assigned to individuals and varying proportions of their neighbors. After describing the theoretical and statistical underpinnings of this design, we apply it to a large-scale voter-mobilization experiment conducted in Chicago during a special election in 2009 using social-pressure mailings that highlight individual electoral participation. We find some evidence of within-household spillovers but no evidence of spillovers across households. We conclude by discussing how multilevel designs might be employed in other substantive domains, such as the study of deterrence and policy diffusion. ©2012, Midwest Political Science Association.},

This ecumenical approach has been fruitful: it has led to complex and multi-faceted accounts of diffusion processes, which, as scholars have shown, are driven by several distinct diffusion mechanisms, such as learning, competition, and emulation. However, most diffusion accounts lack theoretical coherence. The present article addresses this issue in three steps. First, it reviews the recent diffusion literature in political science and shows that it is characterized by considerable theoretical diversity, which has led to internally incoherent explanations. Second, it puts forward a simple model of policy change that is able to supply a basic but effective common theoretical framework for the various diffusion mechanisms identified in the literature. Third, it discusses the implications of this framework for empirical and theoretical research on diffusion.},

	abstract = {This chapter involves a comparative analysis of three policy arrangements in the field of cultural heritage preservation. The aim is to analyse and explain the similarities and differences between contemporary preservation practices in different Western countries. 'Cultural heritage' could be defined as the customs, beliefs, art, way of life and social organisation that a society or group has had for many years, that are considered to be important characteristics of its culture and that it wishes to conserve and pass on to future generations (Hornby et al., 2000; Howard, 2003). In this chapter, the concept of cultural heritage only refers to the category of built heritage, which involves all spatial elements and structures that were constructed in the past and that are regarded as very valuable (Nelissen and Bogie, 2000). Many different arguments are used for the preservation of the built heritage. It is often stated that it makes a positive contribution to our living environment and quality of life; that it provides material for research and education; that it is a source of inspiration for designers of new buildings, urban and rural landscapes; and that it generates income through recreation and tourism. Finally, many preservationists argue that some of the values of cultural heritage are absolute; that some kind of historic value is intrinsic to the whole notion of something being identified as truly old or 'authentic' (Cantacuzino and King, 1999; Clark, 2000; Mason, 2002; Nelissen and Bogie, 2000). Nowadays, a considerable amount of cultural heritage in Western society (Europe and North-America) is being preserved by governmental actors. In most Western countries however, the very first initiatives to preserve cultural heritage typically came from the side of the intellectual elite. Only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, governmental bodies were established with the explicit task of preserving the national heritage. Their work mainly consisted of listing significant historic buildings and protecting them through newly created preservation laws (Howard, 2003; Tyler, 2000). Today, most preservation policies are based on more or less similar principles and ideas such as: the obligation to perform research and documentation in order to generate and safeguard knowledge; the obligation to respect cultural heritage as a physical record of human activity; the obligation to safeguard the authenticity of historic buildings and sites; and the obligation to do no harm (Maturo, 2000). At the same time, current preservation practices still vary greatly: from minimal interventions and conservative repairs to artistic restorations and extensive adaptations according to the fashion of modern life (Jokilehto, 1999; Maturo, 2000). Moreover, policy practices in the field of cultural heritage preservation are continually changing. At present, there appears to be a general trend that preservation policies are becoming broader in scope. Preservationists are moving away from the idea of designating individual sites to the idea that the whole of the landscape may have significance. Accordingly, cultural heritage preservation is becoming increasingly integrated with policy fields such as land use planning, urban renewal and nature management. Furthermore, although preserving the national heritage remains an important policy goal, many preservationists argue that in our age of globalisation, it should be complemented by efforts to safeguard regional and local distinctiveness. Consequently, local and regional heritage is receiving more attention and preservation tasks are being decentralised to local and regional government levels. Finally, there is a growing variety as to the policy actors that are involved in cultural heritage preservation. In many Western countries, the role of non-governmental organisations, historic property owners and private property developers in developing and implementing preservation policies is increasing (Cantacuzino and King, 1999; Clark, 2000; Goverde, 2000; Howard, 2003). In order to analyse the similarities and differences between current preservation practices in Western society, I will compare three different policy arrangements in the field of cultural heritage preservation: the contemporary arrangements in Norway, the Netherlands and Arizona (since preservation arrangements differ considerably from state to state in the US, I concentrate on one of them and I can therefore not draw general conclusions). In accordance with the policy arrangements approach, the arrangements in Norway, Arizona and the Netherlands are analysed as the temporary stabilisations of the organisation and substance of cultural heritage preservation at national or state level. The comparison between the three preservation arrangements is based on two hypotheses. On the one hand, these three policy arrangements have developed within very different historical, social-political and geographical contexts, which has led to the emergence of divergent policy discourses and policy practices. In this perspective, policy arrangements are interpreted as contingent responses to specific circumstances and specific policy processes. At the same time, I am fascinated by the question whether the three policy arrangements are increasingly growing alike along the lines of general developments that are taking place in the field of cultural heritage preservation. Accordingly, I will explore the extent to which a process of policy diffusion is proceeding and I will examine the factors that either stimulate or restrain this process in the three policy arrangements under study. In summary, this chapter analyses and explains the similarities and differences between three different policy arrangements in the field of cultural heritage preservation against the background of (a) the specific contexts in which the policy arrangements have been (re)produced and (b) the process of policy diffusion that may be taking place. However, before I will analyse the three different policy arrangements, two different phases of cultural heritage preservation will be described. Furthermore, I will clarify my interpretation of the concepts 'policy discourses' and 'policy diffusion' and some remarks will be made on the applied research methodology. © 2006 Springer.},

In the absence of formal obligations, regulatory instruments that have been communicated internationally and were already being practiced elsewhere were voluntarily emulated and adopted by policy makers. While the international promotion of regulatory instruments often facilitated their diffusion, the instruments' characteristics determined the extent and speed by which regulatory instruments spread across countries. The voluntary adoption of regulatory instruments cannot be exclusively explained by the rational motivation of policy makers to improve effectiveness. In addition, they were motivated by concerns of legitimacy and perceived pressure to conform with international norms. diffusion; harmonization; imposition; regulatory competition; environmental policy; global environmental governance.},

	abstract = {How can we account for the global diffusion of remarkably similar policy innovations across widely differing nation-states? In an era characterized by heightened globalization and increasingly radical state restructuring, this question has become especially acute. Scholars of international relations offer a number of theoretical explanations for the cross-national convergence of ideas, institutions, and interests. We examine the proliferation of state bureaucracies for gender mainstreaming. These organizations seek to integrate a gender-equality perspective across all areas of government policy. Although they so far have received scant attention outside of feminist policy circles, these mainstreaming bureaucracies-now in place in over 100 countries-represent a powerful challenge to business-as-usual politics and policymaking. As a policy innovation, the speed with which these institutional mechanisms have been adopted by the majority of national governments is unprecedented. We argue that transnational networks composed largely of nonstate actors (notably women's international nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations) have been the primary forces driving the diffusion of gender mainstreaming. In an event history analysis of 157 nation-states from 1975 to 1998, we assess how various national and transnational factors have affected the timing and the type of the institutional changes these states have made. Our findings support the claim that the diffusion of gender-mainstreaming mechanisms has been facilitated by the role played by transnational networks, in particular by the transnational feminist movement. Further, they suggest a major shift in the nature and the locus of global politics and national policymaking.},

Yet there is little empirical evidence regarding the content and distribution of these ideas and even less evidence and fewer theoretical propositions regarding the manner in which ideas transfer or diffuse among judges. Addressing these empirical and theoretical gaps, I survey judges in the Mexican state of Michoacán and apply techniques of network analysis. The project makes four main contributions: (1) original data on the attitudes of judges regarding prominent institutional and jurisprudential changes shaping the legal landscape in Mexico; (2) egocentric data on network structure for the sampled judges; (3) sociocentric data on network structure at the level of judicial district, state supreme court, and entire state generated by aggregating the egocentric data; and (4) a mixed-methods analysis of the causal relationship between network features and judicial attitudes, drawing on egocentric methods, sociocentric methods, and personal interviews with focal individuals. Complementing literatures on political socialization, policy diffusion, and complex systems, the analysis clarifies our understanding of the role of judicial networks in strengthening democracy and the rule of law.},

The dependent variable is the probability that an eligible county will adopt it in a particular year. This probability is negatively related to the obstacles prohibiting the innovation and positively related to(1) the motivations to innovate and (2) the resources for overcoming the obstacles. The findings suggest that the motivations are higher in counties with higher property tax millage rates and the potential of sales tax exportation; the obstacles include high existing sales tax rates and severe tax competition; and the major resource for overcoming these obstacles is the adoption of the LOST in other Georgia counties. © 2005 Sage Publications.},

As the principal mechanism driving innovations' spread, these approaches emphasize external pressures, emanating especially from international financial institutions; the quest for symbolic or normative legitimacy; rational learning and cost-benefit calculation; and cognitive heuristics, respectively. The article assesses which one of these frameworks can best account for the three distinctive features of diffusion, namely its wavelike temporal pattern; its geographical clustering; and the spread of similarity amid diversity. While several approaches contribute to understanding policy diffusion, the analysis suggests that the cognitive-psychological framework offers a particularly persuasive account of the spread of pension reform.},

	abstract = {We argue that the global spread of ideas contributes to trade liberalization. Building on insights from a rich case-based literature, we suggest an explicit mechanism of trade policy diffusion: US-trained Ph.D. economists, who share a common belief in the benefits of free trade, and who operate with varying degrees of political influence around the world. We offer the first cross-national test of the impact of economists on trade liberalization using a unique dataset recording the country of residence of all 6,493 foreign-based, US-trained American Economic Association (AEA) members over the period 1981-1997. Specifically, we measure the influence of economists on the timing and extent of trade liberalization. First, we endogenize the date of trade liberalization using hazard and probit models. Controlling for alternative diffusion mechanisms and other confounding variables, our results suggest that economists significantly speed up the reform process. Second, we find that countries with greater numbers of economists are more open to trade at the end of the period. All of our results are robust to an instrumental variables strategy that employs the number of Fulbright grants allocated by the United States as an instrument for the number of US-trained economists. © 2012 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {In the rush for development, the regulatory state has assumed the mantle of a new panacea: the instruments and mechanisms necessary for better government, better governance, and better lives. This paper poses two basic questions in response to the rise of the regulatory state and its increasing diffusion into developing countries. First, can regulatory states exist in developing societies or, more accurately, can effective regulatory states emerge and hope to function in a manner similar to their counterparts in developed countries and deliver the types of benefits and outcomes they promise? And second, do regulatory states offer the most effective modalities for delivering enhanced social well-being? By unpacking the concept of the regulatory state and addressing its underlying assumptions and implicit normative values, it is suggested that the modalities of governance entailed in the regulatory state model may not be well suited to developing countries, hurting rather than enhancing governance outcomes. These issues are explored in relation to the Indonesian energy sector, specifically the upstream electricity generation, transmission and distribution sectors, and the machinations involved in governing the sector. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Prior scholarship has identified at least two types of information: information about policy and information about political viability. Few empirical approaches have been able to distinguish between these separate mechanisms. The authors argue that an analysis of policy proposals can untangle political information from policy-based information. They employ their strategy with data on the proposal of tax and expenditure limits (TELs) in the U.S. states since 1970 through direct democracy. The authors find that states in close geographic proximity to states that have rejected TELs are significantly less likely to propose TELs themselves. Since this event does not reveal information about policy effectiveness, the authors conclude that information about political viability systematically diffuses from state to state at the proposal stage of policy making. © The Author(s) 2011.},

Why have so many countries with so little in common adopted the same policy so rapidly? This extensive diffusion is particularly puzzling given the lack of evidence that AML policies actually work. In explaining the international spread of AML policies, this article draws on recent literature from International Relations, sociology, comparative politics, and public policy dealing with policy diffusion and policy transfer, but also differs from most of this work in two key aspects: First, it is argued that the process of diffusion in the developing world has been much more power-based than voluntary. Second, the mechanisms driving policy diffusion (direct coercion, mimicry, and competition) are all shown to be discursively mediated exercises of power, rather than reflecting rational learning or brute material forces.

Hypotheses are tested using panel data on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member states from 1995 to 2004. At the domestic level, the authors show that green tax burdens are influenced by the left-right and environmental positions of legislative medians and the power of the energy-producing sector, among other factors.

Chile was master in its own house. Was this a victory for national autonomy over the power of international finance? Clearly not, because the new model being applied in Chile was the precursor of much that was implemented from Washington in the days of structural adjustment. Chile 'won' because it accepted the rules of the new game established by institutions far more powerful than the multilateral development banks. Developmental Washington learned much from Chile and then applied those lessons to the more indebted, smaller and less sophisticated countries.},

In the 1990s, China strove again to emulate Japan and South Korea in restricting foreign direct investment and promoting indigenous corporations. Despite these efforts, China's industrial catch-up was in fact led by FDI, in sharp contrast to the classic Japanese/Korean paradigm where FDI was strictly circumvented. Why was China unsuccessful in learning restrictive FDI policies? How did a new developmental path emerge in China? The answer lies in China's strong networks with diaspora communities. Through a diffusion mechanism, ties between local governments and diaspora capital helped initiate and catalyze China's FDI liberalization, despite the central efforts to learn from Japan and South Korea. Two critical reform episodes are examined: (1) the establishment of special economic zones and (2) the reform of state-owned enterprises.},

This article uses both the policy diffusion literature and the diffusion of innovation literature to assess watershed management councils' decisions to adopt, or not adopt, scientific models. Watershed management councils are a relevant case study because they possess both public and private attributes. We report on a survey of councils in the United States that was conducted to determine the criteria used when selecting scientific models for studying watershed conditions. We found that specific variables from each body of literature play a role in explaining the choice to adopt scientific models by these quasi-public organizations. The diffusion of innovation literature contributes to an understanding of how organizations select models by confirming the importance of a model's ability to provide better data. Variables from the policy diffusion literature showed that watershed management councils that employ consultants are more likely to use scientific models. We found a gap between those who create scientific models and those who use these models. We recommend shrinking this gap through more communication between these actors and advancing the need for developers to provide more technical assistance.},

	abstract = {Various explanations have been advanced for the adoption of increasingly restrictive tobacco control policies in Western democracies, usually based on an examination of individual instruments. Some of the more popular explanations are socioeconomic modernization, interest group politics, political institutions, government ideology and vertical diffusion from the European Union (EU). This paper uses statistical models to test explanations of tobacco control policy across 15 EU member states adopting instruments of Comprehensive Tobacco Control Policy (CPTC) over two decades. Socioeconomic modernization, economic interest groups and domestic political factors all play a role in policy. Although there is declining influence of pro-tobacco domestic constituencies, adoption of CPTC is still inhibited by corporatist practices in member states. Vertical policy diffusion through the EU has aided domestic sources of policy adoption, making tobacco control policy one of multi-level governance and enhancing its comprehensiveness. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

We understand paradigm shifts as radical changes in the metabolism of urban water services, whereby change is informed by a distinct ethos. We reframe paradigm shifts as the function of two factors: 1 the agency of paradigm advocacy 2 the institutional legitimacy of competing paradigms, which defines the landscape of opportunities for paradigm advocacy. Multigroup assessments of the social desirability and sustainability of competing paradigms are made in light of aspirations to normative coherence under conditions of bounded rationality. Finally, we suggest directions for further inquiry. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

These "late-to-innovate" states were unique compared with the preponderance of other states that innovated earlier. Typical internal variables explained why Arizona and Illinois fell into gridlock over election reform initially, but we must turn to other (external) explanations to understand the ultimate decisions to innovate. Also, although they are similar in being late to innovate, these two states display interesting differences as well.},

	abstract = {The dominant approaches to the study of capital account liberalization have highlighted institutional barriers to reform and have also demonstrated an important role for interdependence, or the diffusion of a policy innovation from one country to another, as a causal force. Our approach contrasts with the institutional approach and seeks to clarify the political mechanisms of international policy diffusion. Specifically, we develop and test hypotheses that posit that structural economic legacies of the pre-reform era both condition the way in which international diffusion operates, and create the societal and economic interests that help produce varying capital account policy outcomes in the domestic political sphere. Analysis of capital account liberalization strategies in post-debt-crisis Latin America (1983-2007) reveals that capital account opening and the channels through which this innovation diffuses are conditioned by the legacy of a country's pre-debt crisis economic development model. Specifically, the degree to which advanced import-substituting industrialization was pursued prior to the reform era affects capital account policy by shaping both the relevant international peer groups through which policy models diffuse, and the sorts of domestic interests that are likely to influence the liberalization process. International diffusion also varies in its impact depending on domestic political and economic conditions. © 2012 by The IO Foundation.},

It finds that the literature has evolved from its rather narrow, state-centred roots to cover many more actors and venues.

Furthermore, the statistical models used to assess this effect have been fundamentally flawed. In this article, I consider more fully the potential impacts of social learning on policy diffusion, and develop a simple approach to modeling these impacts more flexibly.

The empirical findings indicate that the competition mechanism induced by network position similarity in the network of portfolio investment and that of exports causes policy diffusion in corporate taxation; the socialization mechanism (policy learning and emulation) induced by network position proximity in the IGO networks also drives policy changes, and the evidence is much stronger in the IGO networks that facilitate policy learning than in those that facilitate emulation. The paper also discusses explicitly empirical challenges to incorporate network characteristics into connectivity matrices in spatial lag models often used to study policy diffusion. It suggests that students of policy diffusion should discuss as explicitly as possible the assumptions and procedures to construct connectivity matrices and present results from alternative specifications: our conclusion on the strength of policy diffusion is often sensitive to the choice of connectivity matrices. © 2010 International Studies Association.},

	abstract = {In political science, rational learning and bounded learning are commonly studied as two opposing theories of policy choice. In this paper, I use a rational-learning approach to reach conclusions about bounded learning, showing that the two theories are not necessarily incompatible. By examining a rational-learning model and the decisions of a set of developing countries to open up their trade regimes, I show that countries are particularly influenced by the choices of neighbouring countries and by particularly successful policy experiences. These are two typical contentions of the bounded-learning literature. I argue that bounded learning and rational learning yield the same results as soon as one drops the rational-learning assumption that there are zero costs to gathering new information. I use the discussion on rational learning versus bounded learning as a basis for exploring more general issues concerning the diffusion of policy innovations.},

Unlike traditional policy adoption and diffusion studies that focus on the state level and use a dichotomous dependent variable-adoption or not-this article focuses on local school districts and uses the number of operating charter schools as the dependent variable. Accordingly, instead of applying event history analysis, this article conducts generalized event count regression to estimate models. Based on a data set that consists of Florida's 67 school districts across a six-year time period, the results suggest that charter school diffusion is more heavily driven by political and institutional factors than by educational needs.

How can we explain the timing and extent of financial liberalization across countries since the 1970s? We argue that IMF stabilization programs provide a window of opportunity for governments to initiate financial reforms, but that policy makers are more likely to seize this opportunity when welfare expenditures are high. Large loans from the IMF shield policy makers from the costs of financial reform, while welfare expenditures provide credibility to the government's ex ante promises of compensation to individuals who are harmed by the reforms. We test this hypothesis on data for 87 countries from 1975 to 2002. We employ a spatial autoregressive error sample selection model which accounts for the nonrandom participation of countries in IMF programs as well as the processes of international policy diffusion. The results provide strong support for the interactive effect of IMF programs and domestic welfare expenditures on financial liberalization. © 2010, Midwest Political Science Association.},

In view of what has been produced using this perspective, there is every reason to develop alternative points of view. In this article we present the main features of one such alternative: the constructivist translation perspective. The translation perspective depicts policy diffusion as an imitation process, where meaning is constructed by disembedding policy ideas from their previous context and using them as models for altered political structures in a new context. The translation metaphor draws attention to the importance of a deepened problematisation of the policy concept, the personal character of the translation, and to the fact that translation processes are always tied to local contexts. Policy translation should be seen as an open, continuous process, never independent of the societal distribution of power. In this article the translation perspective is outlined and illustrated by a detailed case study of the Swedish methadone maintenance treatment programme. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

Such a phenomenon is also described as 'globalisation of European regulations'. It has been argued that the regulatory policies of non-EU countries are influenced by European regulation, and may end up mirroring European policy. This article attempts to analyse such a voluntary policy adaptation to Europe, based upon a study of the EU's new chemical regulation, known as 'REACH'. This article focuses on a recent Japanese chemical policy reform and analyses how the Japanese reform interacts with REACH. However, the Japanese case analysis has found that the influence of REACH upon the Japanese reform was limited, and this article seeks to explain why Japan hesitated to move toward the REACH-type policy reform.

The authors summarize an extensive research project they directed that included a survey of every state that offers a lottery, a general population survey of Georgia citizen attitudes toward the lottery, and results from an economic model summarizing the economic effects of the lottery. The analysis reveals that the Georgia lottery has been a significant source of revenue for the state's budget and operates in an administratively cost-effective manner. The analysis also confirms the conventional wisdom that lower-income households spend a greater proportionate share of their income on the lottery and that African Americans are more frequent players than whites. Furthermore, the Georgia lottery enjoys broad public support, the key to which appears to be the earmarking of lottery funds to specific, new, popular education programs. However, the data reveal that those educational programs promulgated by the Georgia lottery benefit citizens from both high and low socioeconomic status. Finally, the article suggests that lottery-generated funds may reach a plateau or peak during the first decade of implementation and that state policymakers should design lottery-funded programs accordingly.},

	abstract = {Why do very different countries often emulate the same policy model? Two years after Ronald Reagan's income-tax simplification of 1986, Brazil adopted a similar reform even though it threatened to exacerbate income disparity and jeopardize state revenues. And Chile's pension privatization of the early 1980s has spread throughout Latin America and beyond even though many poor countries that have privatized their social security systems, including Bolivia and El Salvador, lack some of the preconditions necessary to do so successfully. In a major step beyond conventional rational-choice accounts of policy decision-making, this book demonstrates that bounded--not full--rationality drives the spread of innovations across countries. When seeking solutions to domestic problems, decision-makers often consider foreign models, sometimes promoted by development institutions like the World Bank. But, as Kurt Weyland argues, policymakers apply inferential shortcuts at the risk of distortions and biases. Through an in-depth analysis of pension and health reform in Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Peru, Weyland demonstrates that decision-makers are captivated by neat, bold, cognitively available models. And rather than thoroughly assessing the costs and benefits of external models, they draw excessively firm conclusions from limited data and overextrapolate from spurts of success or failure. Indications of initial success can thus trigger an upsurge of policy diffusion. © 2006 by Princeton University Press. All Rights Reserved.},

This initiative of the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment contributed to the building of the current Northern Irish Peace Process.

The history of the MBW initiative also provides insight into the interaction of two contending models for organizing European Society, namely 'Regulated Capitalism' and 'Neoliberalism' and the relationship of these models to partnership theory. This study argues that motivations for the development of partnerships in Belfast defy easy theoretical classification; yet empirical evidence suggests that a twin-track approach-one from above, the European Union; and one from below, of indigenous policy evolution-have together through policy diffusion made MBW a leading pioneer in partnership theory and practice. The article discusses the literature on partnership within New Public Administration outlining ideas on various classifications of partnerships operative in the public sector.

Using published government reports, press releases, public hearings, newspaper articles, and interviews, I demonstrate that reciprocal learning occurred because one country's policymakers and practitioners explicitly discussed and/or referred to the practices in the other country when deciding to adopt a specific policy solution to the problem of excessive executive pay.

Forms of cooperation include training officials from developing countries in Japan, dispatch of Japanese local government expert officials to developing countries, partnering with and providing assistance to international organizations, establishing organizations for international environmental cooperation, and hosting international intercity network programs. This cooperation can be explained by a combination of environment-related factors and degree of local area's international orientation. Environment-related factors include desire to make a contribution based on local experience and human capital, promotion of international environmental business, response to trans-boundary pollution issues, and conservation of natural assets. Collaboration with the national government is an important facilitating though not determining factor since local governments respond differently to national policies. Other facilitating factors include local governments' fiscal capacity. The cases in this study can promote consideration of the potential motivations and ways that local governments in industrialized countries can contribute to international environmental development. © 2011 SAGE Publications.},

Comparatively, Flanders can be classified as an early moderniser, followed by the federal government, which had been locked longer in a trajectory of maintenance. The French-speaking governments of the Walloon Region and French Community are late modernisers, and compared to both the Flemish and federal government their reform efforts are more fragmented and incremental. The main factors explaining variations in administrative reform in Belgium are differences in institutional continuity, policy entrepreneurship and policy diffusion, all three of which combined to support administrative reform efforts at the Flemish and, slightly less so, at the federal levels, and were markedly absent in the French-speaking governments. Aggregated indicators of differences in political culture do not convincingly explain differences in public sector reform, but the degree of partisan control over the administration, as a meso dimension of politico-administrative culture, impacts on the French-speaking governments' resistance against certain types of organisational and human resources management reforms.},

	abstract = {Policy diffusion is a process whereby political bodies 'learn' policy solutions to public health problems by imitating policy from similar jurisdictions. This suggests that diffusion is a critical element in the policy development process, and that its role must be recognised in any examination of policy development. Yet, to date, no systematic work on the diffusion of smoke-free spaces bylaws has been reported. We examined the diffusion of municipal smoke-free bylaws over a 30-year period in the provinces of Alberta and Ontario, Canada, to begin to address this gap and to determine whether spatial patterns could be identified to help explain the nature of policy development. Bylaw adoption and change were analysed within local, regional, and provincial contexts. Geographical models of hierarchical and expansion diffusion in conjunction with the diffusion of innovations framework conceptually guided the analyses. Study findings contribute to a broader understanding of how and why health policies diffuse across time and place. Policy development can be a powerful mechanism for creating environments that support healthy decisions; hence, an understanding of policy diffusion is critical for those interested in policy interventions aimed at improving population health in any jurisdiction. © 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Specifically, the study examines whether the states have adopted more similar incarceration levels over time (converged), whether they tend to change in the same direction at the same time (synchronous change), and whether they tend to stay in the same relative positions vis-à-vis one another, such that the historical policy position has long-term implications for later policy positions ("feed-forward" effects). The results indicate that, in spite of a century of social, political, and economic integration, the policy positions of the states have not exhibited a sustained convergence toward a common level of incarceration, but have undergone cycles, with some periods of convergence followed by periods of divergence. Change has generally been synchronous-as states tend to move in the same direction at the same time as if propelled by national forces even though incarceration levels are determined by state and local policy and the use of discretion by criminal justice officials. The results also indicate a profound "feed-forward" effect in that the position of the states vis-à-vis one another historically has substantial predictive power for their position in subsequent years. © 2012 Policy Studies Organization.},

Drawing upon the Bass mixed influence diffusion model, this research generates measures of the coefficients of external and internal influences for diffusion for 81 public policy innovations that have spread across the United States.

In this chapter, we investigate whether and how either liberal or restrictive international financial policies on capital account regulation spread globally, both through the direct effects of changes in global ideology on government policy and indirectly, through policy diffusion between other states. In the following sections we: (1) provide a detailed account of the mechanisms of diffusion, focusing on the theoretical basis for the global, grassroots spread of ideas that affect government policies; (2) identify valid indicators of ideological change that will aid in identifying the mechanisms through which it is diffused; (3) discuss our models and methods, focusing on how ideology is diffused indirectly and globally through influence on other governments' policies; and (4) report the results of our study, and offer concluding remarks. How ideas spread: While global convergence toward political and economic liberalism might be a defining story of the last two decades of the twentieth century, we find scant evidence that convergence around a particular set of policies regarding capital account liberalization is consistent over time or space. During the entire twentieth century, many distinct waves of international financial openness and closure diffused worldwide. Based upon the work of many scholars, we know many of the domestic and international political and economic forces that account for change in international financial openness. © 2007, Cambridge University Press.},

The results show that the four local governments adapt to sustainable development in quite different ways, from local translation processes (Hallefors and Orebro) to resistance and ignorance (Karlskoga and Lekeberg). This variation is interpreted in relation to the importance of local contexts. There is no intra-regional spreading of ideas leading to convergence among the cases. However, not only the local context matters, but also policy areas and development projects constitute contexts, indicating the importance of intra-local differences.},

First, we distinguish among and find evidence for four mechanisms of policy diffusion: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate cities, imitation of larger cities, and coercion by state governments. Second, we find a temporal component to these effects, with imitation being a more short-lived diffusion process than the others. Third, we show that these mechanisms are conditional, with larger cities being better able to learn from others, less fearful of economic spillovers, and less likely to rely on imitation. © 2008, Midwest Political Science Association.},

	abstract = {This article analyses and compares the development of activation policies for young people in Denmark and the UK from the mid-1990s. Despite their diverse welfare traditions and important differences in the organisation and delivery of benefits and services for the unemployed, both countries have recently introduced large-scale compulsory activation programmes for young people. These programmes share a number of common features, especially a combination of strong compulsion and an apparently contradictory emphasis on client-centred training and support for participants. The suggested transition from the 'Keynesian welfare state' to the 'Schumpeterian workfare regime' is used as a framework to discuss the two countries' recent moves towards activation. It is argued that while this framework is useful in explaining the general shift towards active labour-market policies in Europe, it alone cannot account for the particular convergence of the Danish and British policies in the specific area of youth activation. Rather, a number of specific political factors explaining the development of policies in the mid-1990s are suggested. The article concludes that concerns about mass youth unemployment, the influence of the 'dependency culture' debate in various forms, cross-national policy diffusion and, crucially, the progressive re-engineering of compulsory activation by strong centre-left governments have all contributed to the emergence of policies that mix compulsion and a commitment to the centrality of work with a 'client-centred approach' that seeks to balance more effective job seeking with human resource development. However, attempts to combine the apparently contradictory concepts of 'client-centredness' and compulsion are likely to prove politically fragile, and both countries risk lurching towards an increasingly workfarist approach. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the International Journal of Social Welfare 2004.},

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six Armenian higher education leaders and analysed in terms of the following five aspects relevant to leadership: policy transfer and diffusion; change knowledge; emotional intelligence; leadership approach; and causal attribution. The leaders spoke positively about the reform efforts but blamed teachers, government, students and society for the failure of the reform efforts in Armenia. The conclusion is that, irrelevant of whether the change is top-down or bottom-up, it is destined to fail if the change knowledge of the actual implementers is not taken into consideration, an active dialogue does not occur with the actual implementers of the changes and the implements of change are thus not involved in the reform process. © The Author(s) 2012.},

I posit that interstate professional associations provide institutional foundations for the development and dissemination of innovations by state officials with jurisdiction over particular policy areas. I test this hypothesis by examining the determinants of state adoption of the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Model Act, a comprehensive set of regulations developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). My central finding is that states whose insurance commissioner participated in the NAIC's Accident and Health Insurance Committee, which has jurisdiction over HMO regulation, were more likely than other states to adopt the Model Act. This result provides evidence that associations can affect policy diffusion. It also sharpens the conventional wisdom by highlighting a specific institutional arrangement - a committee system - through which participation in associations can facilitate the adoption of innovations.},

These studies stress the complexity of context that modifies exports of policy and the need for interpretation or experimentalism in the assemblage of policy. The second half of the paper focuses on role of international organisations and non-state actors in transnational transfer in the spread of norms, standard setting and development of professional communities or networks that promote harmonisation and policy coordination. The 'soft' transfer of ideas and information via networks whether they be personal, professional or electronic is rapid and frequent. It is rather more infrequent to see such ideas structure governance and become institutionalised.

	abstract = {Why do very different countries often emulate the same policy model? Two years after Ronald Reagan's income-tax simplification of 1986, Brazil adopted a similar reform even though it threatened to exacerbate income disparity and jeopardize state revenues. And Chile's pension privatization of the early 1980s has spread throughout Latin America and beyond even though many poor countries that have privatized their social security systems, including Bolivia and El Salvador, lack some of the preconditions necessary to do so successfully. In a major step beyond conventional rational-choice accounts of policy decision-making, this book demonstrates that bounded--not full--rationality drives the spread of innovations across countries. When seeking solutions to domestic problems, decision-makers often consider foreign models, sometimes promoted by development institutions like the World Bank. But, as Kurt Weyland argues, policymakers apply inferential shortcuts at the risk of distortions and biases. Through an in-depth analysis of pension and health reform in Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Peru, Weyland demonstrates that decision-makers are captivated by neat, bold, cognitively available models. And rather than thoroughly assessing the costs and benefits of external models, they draw excessively firm conclusions from limited data and overextrapolate from spurts of success or failure. Indications of initial success can thus trigger an upsurge of policy diffusion. © 2006 by Princeton University Press. All Rights Reserved.},

Following Berry and Berry (1990), event-history analysis has been the method of choice for the quantitative investigation of policy diffusion, but Volden (2006) has recently introduced a dyadic variant of this method in which units of analysis are not states but, instead, pairs of states. This article discusses the dyadic approach with a particular focus on the diffusion of policies in Switzerland. The goal is not to introduce a new method, but rather to provide a practical overview for researchers interested in using it. The article shows how the method has migrated from the international relations literature to the policy-diffusion literature, describes the typical structure of a dyadic dataset in a diffusion context, and discusses several modeling issues. The usefulness of the dyadic approach is illustrated empirically with the example of health-insurance subsidy policies in Swiss cantons. © (2008) Swiss Political Science Review.},

A case is made for incorporating formal public policy education in the training of higher civil service to improve professional competence of civil servants as key contributors to the policy-formulation process. Evidence, based on systematic analysis of public policies, can help identify best practices and help develop benchmarking criteria for future policies. A higher civil service that has had a quality public policy education, combined with access to data, evaluation of policies, establishment of policy research programmes, and use of information technologies, can contribute greatly to improving professionalism in the policy-making process and to better governance in the country.},

These policies have affected the lives of millions of people, yet our most sophisticated political economy models do not adequately capture influences on these policy choices. Evidence suggests that the adoption of liberal economic practices is highly clustered both temporally and spatially. We hypothesize that this clustering might be due to processes of policy diffusion. We think of diffusion as resulting from one of two broad sets of forces: one in which mounting adoptions of a policy alter the benefits of adopting for others and another in which adoptions provide policy relevant information about the benefits of adopting. We develop arguments within these broad classes of mechanisms, construct appropriate measures of the relevant concepts, and test their effects on liberalization and restriction of the current account, the capital account, and the exchange rate regime. Our findings suggest that domestic models of foreign economic policy making are insufficient. The evidence shows that policy transitions are influenced by international economic competition as well as the policies of a country's sociocultural peers. We interpret the latter influence as a form of channeled learning reflecting governments' search for appropriate models for economic policy.},

Norms do not simply standardize state behaviors, as is conventionally argued; norms also draw on and set up hierarchical social orders among states. Through a conceptual rethinking we gain a better understanding of where-among which states-new policies may first emerge: social hierarchies create incentives for new policies to develop at the margins of international society so that policies may diffuse "from below." We also get a better grasp of how policy advocates frame the appropriateness or benefits of a new state practice: they must frame policy demands in terms of the international standing and rank of the targeted state. This article's empirical aspiration is to use these insights to help account for the international policy diffusion of legal sex quotas, a policy to increase the level of female legislators that developed first among "developing" states rather than among the so-called core of international society.

It is argued that diffusion influences emanating from the tax policies of other states have an effect that is conditional upon the government ideology in a focal state. Specifically, it is shown that only those state governments that are not positioned on the far right end of an ideology continuum use an environment of high cigarette taxes to pursue their fiscal and health policy goals. At the same time, interventionist ideology can only be effective if it operates within a favorable policy environment. I argue that casting policy diffusion as conditional allows for empirically more accurate and theoretically richer models.},

This article considers the diffusion of the partnership principle in the EU, focusing on Britain and Sweden. It is concerned with two questions. First, has the partnership principle led to a process of harmonisation across states or to national resistance? Second, to what extent has the partnership principle enhanced the legitimacy of EU decision making? The evidence presented here suggests that though there has not been significant resistance to the partnership principle within Britain and Sweden, the EU's requirements have been interpreted and implemented differently in the two states. Thus it is more appropriate to speak of 'adaptation' to partnership rather than 'adoption'. This is explained by what we summarise as 'national democratic traditions'. In terms of democratic legitimacy, the Swedish adaptation to partnership was nominally more democratic in that local politicians were readily involved from the outset, whereas in Britain they were not. However, the importance of this inclusion should not be overstated in relation to substantive democratic legitimacy. The Swedish model was not supported by well-articulated democratic strategies or principles. Despite the limitations of the Swedish model, recent developments suggest that Britain is following a similar path.},

	abstract = {I offer an explanation for the widespread diffusion of neoliberal tax policies in the developed democracies. After accounting for the policy influences of commonly experienced domestic and international forces, I consider several plausible paths of diffusion of neoliberal tax structure. My central argument is that the highly visible 1980s market-conforming tax reform in the United States should be especially important in shaping subsequent tax policies in other polities. There are substantial reasons to believe, however, that domestic political and institutional forces will shape policy-maker assessment of the benefits and costs of neoliberal reforms: the strength of right parties and the degree to which the median voter has moved right should condition adoption of neoliberal tax policy; the institutions of national and sector-coordinated capitalism should also slow the enactment of neoliberal tax reforms. I assess these arguments with empirical models of 1981-98 tax rates on capital in sixteen nations. I find that changes in U.S. tax policy influence subsequent reforms in other polities; in the long term, all nations move toward the U.S. neoliberal tax structure. Analysis also shows, however, that the short-term responsiveness to U.S. tax reforms is notably greater where uncoordinated market institutions are dominant. Theory and extensive qualitative and quantitative evidence indicate that pressures to compete for mobile assets, as balanced against the economic and political costs of adoption, anchor the process of diffusion of neoliberal tax policy. There is little evidence for the view that systematic policy learning or social emulation drove tax policy diffusion. © 2006 by The IO Foundation.},

I offer an additional explanation, the social contagion model, which suggests that state residents react to neighboring policies by changing their aggregate opinions on that policy. If state opinion becomes supportive, state officials respond by enacting similar policies in the home state or risk being ousted from office.

	abstract = {This study examines educational systems and the changes observed within them alongside changes in the wider political economy. The research was conducted through comparative case studies of England and Germany, two countries that in the varieties of capitalism (VoC) literature exemplify two very different types of economic coordination (thereby, this study follows a "most different research design"). Expanding upon the VoC approach, this book analyses not only vocational education and training but also school education and higher education, since these two areas contribute decisively to national skill formation. The point of departure is the puzzling observation that the current reforms of the educational systems in both countries depart from the paths predicted by the VoC approach. The study thus argues against institutional path-dependency in the two countries and in favour of an ideational approach based on discursive institutionalism. The theoretical chapter (second chapter) opens this study with a discussion of discursive institutionalism, policy diffusion, and conceptual mechanisms of institutional change. It also provides a framework that accounts for path-deviant discourses and reforms. This is followed by a description of the three educational areas in both countries and an outline of the paths that the systems should have taken if they had evolved path-dependently. Thereby, this chapter serves as a reference point against which recent developments are assessed (fourth chapter). Next, the visions and aims of the governments are identified through a textual discourse analysis of various British government White Papers that formulate policies on skill formation. The same procedure is applied for relevant policy papers in Germany (fifth chapter). Finally, the transformation of visions into concrete policy measures is analysed by focusing on three important reform measures in each country (sixth chapter). On the basis of the policy cycle stages these measures are traced back to their original intention, which are then compared with the implemented initiatives. This procedure sheds light on how reforms match and potentially alter the existing institutional design, how ideas drive educational reforms, and how they resist, "bend", or even vanish once they are implemented through concrete policy initiatives. © 2011 VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften | Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH All rights reserved.},

As laboratories of democracy, states have developed different levels and mixes of policies to address climate change, nonpoint source pollution, alternative energy, and other challenging environmental issues. Policy scholars have sought to explain variation in state environmental policy through two primary theoretical lenses: internal determinants and regional diffusion. While our understanding of state environmental policy adoption has grown to identify which variables are most important, less is known about how these variables interact in particular states to influence policy adoption. This study examines the interactions of variables from both theories to explain how state policies for small-scale wind energy promotion were adopted in three U.S. states. Our results highlight the nuanced role of citizen ideology, which may be important in contexts at either end of the ideological spectrum but less important in the middle-where economic development is more critical. Results also indicate that interstate competition may be over environmental as well as economic leadership. Interestingly, strength of the wind resource is not necessarily correlated with policy adoption for small-scale wind energy promotion. © 2010 Policy Studies Organization.},

Second, they encourage policy emulation by creating a sense of affinity among countries that are closely connected by IGO networks. Finally, some powerful IGOs ''coerce'' their member states to adopt certain policies. We used causal modeling to test the relationships between different types of IGOs (and the causal mechanisms to which they mostly correspond) and policy convergence. The findings demonstrate the important roles played by salient IGOs such as the WTO, the EU, and the OECD, with each of them having a strong converging effect on their member states' domestic economic policies. More interestingly, we find that the cumulative effects of multiple layers of even the weakest types of IGOs have strong causal effects on states' domestic policies. Indeed, the shared memberships in IGOs with economic functions and with the minimal level of institutional capacity are not only statistically associated with, but also have converging causal effects on, countries' domestic policies. This supports the information-driven policy learning mechanism. The emulation mechanism in which IGO networks create a sense of affinity and therefore facilitate policy diffusion and convergence, on the other hand, is not supported by empirical analysis. © 2009 International Studies Association.},

	abstract = {There is reason to believe that environmental policy convergence resulting from policy diffusion is influenced not only by functional imperatives of the world market, but also by a collective behaviour of national governments, where pioneer countries function as (intellectual) leaders under conditions of uncertainty. Their solutions for general environmental problems are adopted by other countries. As a rule, there is one single solution that is preferred by a large group or the majority of countries. This regulatory 'conformism' makes pioneer roles of countries highly relevant. The article analyses the character and role of such 'trend-setters' in environmental policy. A necessary condi tion for becoming a pioneer country in environmental policy is a high domestic capacity for environmental policy-making. This encompasses institutional, economic and informational framework conditions as well as the relative strength of the green advocacy coalition of a country. While these factors refer to relatively stable factors of policy-making, this does not explain why sometimes countries give up their roles as pioneers. To explain this, an analytical framework is proposed that encompasses situative factors, strategic factors and actor constellations, especially the coalition between organized proponents of environmental objectives and economic modernizers. This coalition of ecological modernizers may break down, for example in times of economic crisis. The political and economic framework conditions of globalization may sometimes bear impediments for pioneers, but at the same time they also provide incentives for highly advanced countries to take over national pioneer roles - at least in the field of environmental protection, which has become an important issue in the competition for innovation.

China and Vietnam are not, however, converging upon the global regulatory model, even allowing for customary national variations. Rather, they are building up distinctive forms of regulatory regimes aiming to maintain the party-state's control over key state sectors, while at the same time integrating with the global economy and conforming to international norms and standards. This study argues that the regulatory model being adopted in Vietnam and China is the product of a specific kind of transition from a command to a market economy within an authoritarian political regime. While diffusion theories are of use in identifying external driving forces for the reform effort, these theories are of limited value for unveiling the dynamics of local contexts. Indigenous incentives, opportunity structures, and the experimental nature of public policy explain why, despite their exposure to global reform movements and commitment to multilateral institutions, China and Vietnam are likely to end up not with just a variety of the same regulatory regime, but a different one. The case of telecommunications regulation is used to illustrate this. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

It outlines the current status of U.S. climate change action and explores four overlapping pathways of policy change: (1) the strategic demonstration of the feasibility of climate change action; (2) the creation and expansion of markets; (3) policy diffusion and learning; and (4) the creation and promulgation of norms about the need for more aggressive climate change action. These four pathways seek to fruitfully draw from rationalist and constructivist approaches to policy analysis, without collapsing or confusing the different logics. Building on this analysis, it predicts that future federal U.S. climate policy will include six major components: (1) A national cap on GHG emissions; (2) A national market based cap-and-trade GHG emissions trading scheme; (3) Mandatory renewable energy portfolio standards; (4) Increased national product standards for energy efficiency; (5) Increased vehicle fleet energy efficiency standards; and (6) Increased federal incentives for research and development on energy efficiency issues and renewable energy development. In addition, expanding federal climate policy may bring about significant changes in U.S. foreign policy as U.S. international re-engagement on climate change is likely to occur only after the development of more significant federal policy. © 2007 by The Policy Studies Organization.},

Specifically, measures of fiscal stress, economic development, tourism, religiosity, and income levels are tested for their relationship to national decisions to legalize casino gambling. This study found that economic development needs, as measured by general unemployment rates, were associated with the casino legalization decisions of national governments. Higher unemployment rates were more likely in the years that nations legalized casino gambling. Religiosity, measured by frequency of church attendance, was also found to be a significant barrier in legalization decisions. Measures of fiscal stress, tourism, and income levels were not found to have significant relationships with the legalization decisions. This is interesting because these factors are often cited in case studies, media reports, and the statements of politicians during legalization processes. This study points to the need for further research in several areas. Further exploration of potential explanatory variables and more appropriate measures of currently theorized factors is warranted. Another area for further research is the seeming contradictory findings of multiple statistical analyses and multiple anecdotal findings of the impacts of fiscal stress on the casino legalization decision. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

It was the government's aim to forge a new settlement with the sector after eleven years of Liberal/National Coalition government during which contractual governance rather than relational governance was the norm. The provenance of the National Compact, launched in March 2010, can be traced back to similar framework documents for inter-sectoral cooperation in the United Kingdom (principally, The Compact) and Canada (the Accord). The National Compact) cannot be explained solely in terms of policy diffusion or the predilection of centre-right political parties for policy instruments of this sort. Rather, explanation requires a more nuanced contextual analysis of the political and policy environment within which these frameworks emerged. In this article we compare the range of factors contributing to the development of The Compact (UK), the Accord) (Canada) and the National Compact (Australia). We apply a similar analysis to policy frameworks in selected Australian states. We conclude that compacts arrive on the policy agenda via the opening of policy windows and through the actions of policy entrepreneurs. Policy windows and the attention of policy entrepreneurs might be both contextual and therefore, time-limited. We consider the range of factors that appear to have a bearing on the impact and durability of inter-sectoral policy frameworks in each jurisdiction in order to draw tentative conclusions about the prospects for the Australian National Compact.  © 2012 Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {Comparative policy analysis increasingly faces the challenge of incorporating external forces on national policy developments into its analytical framework. Scholars of international relations have recognized that the behaviour of states - in terms of policy outputs - converges even in the absence of binding international agreements. These two branches of research can be bridged by the concept of policy diffusion. Diffusion analysis asks for those conditions that favour or hinder the spread of policy innovations within the international system. However, the scientific community struggles with different meanings and notions of the term policy diffusion. Thus, the aim of this paper is to offer a general conceptual framework for the study of diffusion processes within the international system. Understanding the process of policy diffusion requires an analysis of the complex interplay between transnational and international forces, national factors and the characteristics of policy innovations. By providing a conceptual framework this paper hopes not only to contribute to the theoretical debate but also to give guidance for empirical research.

Current literature on innovation diffusion largely overlooks the diffusion of nonprofit program innovation. Although several streams of related diffusion research have considered organizational change and government policy transfer, they miss organizational and contextual factors particularly important for nonprofits. This study considers organizational and environmental factors in the transfer of state-level nonprofit program innovation using in-depth interviews with 74 policy actors to examine the spread of the T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood Project to nonprofits in four states. It identifies similarities and differences between nonprofit program and government policy diffusion and proposes a modified framework for state-level nonprofit program diffusion that consists of multiple stages and participant roles. © 2010 SAGE Publications.},

The physical law of heat transfer (conduction) through a planar wall provides a useful depiction of change management that is ideal for the engineering management instruction and practice. The concept of heat transfer explains that the rate of heat transfer through a wall separating a high from low temperature regions, is determined by the temperature difference and material properties of the wall. This paper draws on nascent work in this area at Texas Tech University. We explain the expectation that the rate of adoption of a new method, policy, or other such initiative, is determined by the difference in initial policy status and the characteristics of the barrier between the leading (already adopted) and laggard (yet to adopt) organizations. The resulting model is useful for gap analysis and resource allocation decisions. It is also a useful tool for explaining change management to technical managers.

To explain this life cycle of diffusion across the international state system, we argue that BIT signing followed a traditional logic of diffusion for an innovation albeit here in the policy realm. In the first period, BITs provided a solution to the time inconsistency problem facing host governments and foreign investors. In the second period, these treaties became the global standard governing foreign investment. As the density of BITs among peer countries increased, more countries signed them in order to gain legitimacy and acceptance without a full understanding of their costs and competencies. More recently, as the potential legal liabilities involved in BIT signing have become more broadly understood, the pattern of adoption has reverted to a more competitive and rational logic. Our empirical tests of BIT signing over four decades provide evidence for such a three-stage model. © SAGE Publications 2011.},

	abstract = {Background: School district wellness policies designed to reduce obesity and promote student health and well-being often lack specific requirements or any mandate that schools comply with the policy. Researchers, educators, and policymakers have called for states to take an active role in shaping district policies. The objective of this study was to determine if states with strong school-based nutrition and physical activity (PA)-related policies have stronger district wellness policies, and explore the direction of policy diffusion between states and districts. METHODS: State policies and nationally representative samples of district policies for the 2006-2007 and 2008-2009 school years were obtained across 5 domains-competitive foods, school meals, nutrition education, physical education (PE), and PA-and were classified as "strong" or "weak," based on policy language, in each grade level (elementary, middle, high). Linear models estimated the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between state and district policies. RESULTS: In 2006-2007 and 2008-2009, district elementary school competitive food policies were stronger in states with strong policies. For policies governing competitive foods in high schools and school meals at all grade levels, mean district policy strength increased from 2006-2007 to 2008-2009 in states with strong 2006-2007 policies. States that strengthened their PE policies from 2006-2007 to 2008-2009 saw an increase in mean district PE policy strength. Across all domains, states that had weak 2006-2007 policies and made no changes saw little increase in district policy strength. CONCLUSION: District competitive food, school meal, and PE policies are stronger in states that have developed strong policies in these domains. © 2012, American School Health Association.},

While in the mid-1980s, no European country provided explicit recognition to gay and lesbian couples, by 2009, 16 European countries had legalized these unions. Using event history models, the article tests predictions of the world society theory and Inglehart's domestic-cultural theory. Results provide strong support for the world society and domestic-cultural theories. Countries with a higher level of value secularization and stronger links to the global cultural order are more likely to introduce legal protections for SSUs. © The Author(s) 2013.},

	abstract = {Fiscal pressures faced by American cities from the late 1970s to the early 1980s renewed the attention of fiscal policy analysts to the financial health of local communities. As a result, numerous efforts were made to evaluate various governments' fiscal conditions, and to identify new forms of activity that could assist in maintaining the fiscal health of the communities. Essentially, fiscal difficulties faced by U.S. cities stimulated their governments to innovate. However, from the perspective of the literature on innovation, innovation is an expensive process that requires upfront and continuous investments. Given these two sets of arguments, the question arises as to whether or not the availability of financial resources is a determinant of innovative government activity. This study examines the relationship between the fiscal health of U.S. city governments and the scope of their adopted innovation. The importance of the availability of slack resources as an incentive for governments to innovate is analyzed. A multifaceted index of government fiscal health and a measure of the scope of innovation are developed in the course of this case study of a randomly selected sample of cities in North Carolina (U.S.A.) with populations above 25,000. This study concludes that fiscally healthy city governments in North Carolina are more likely to engage in innovation activities than fiscally stressed city governments. Logically, higher slack resource availability in a government is usually associated with some stage of innovation implementation, although without any traceable consistency.},

These markets determine the value of an emerging market economy's currency and have brought about increasing currency volatility. In order to bring some form of regulation to these markets to reduce volatility, an international coalition is essential as these are global markets operating on a global scale. This article suggests that a coalition of emerging market economies may not be sufficient to bring about such regulation as some of these economies (particularly India and China) are beneficiaries of the new financial regime. If countries such as Brazil and South Africa are seeking an international coalition for regulation, then the social democratic movements of Western Europe may be more appropriate coalition partners than the regimes of India and China.},

Recently, this debate has yielded an outcome in the form of the so-called Hartz laws, a bundle of labour market policies aimed at the reduction of unemployment and the decrease of non-wage labour costs. The Hartz reforms have played a prominent role in the public discussion, but are they really a watershed as both optimists and pessimists claim? In this article we investigate in what sense the Hartz reforms mark a substantive political change and how they are related to similar processes in other countries. To characterise the policy output we discuss three views of policy reform: reform as a process of policy-learning, reform as a process of competitive realignment and reform as a process of reinforcing path dependence. We show which of the three paradigms accounts for which part of the political result. We find evidence for both policy diffusion and retrenchment, but it is too early to speak of a change of regime. Rather, both the changes thus far and the blocked proposals follow a traditional German logic of strong institutional resistance. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

This deficit can be not only traced back to a lack of empirical findings, but is also the result of the heterogeneous and partially inconsistent theoretical literature on policy convergence. Although policy convergence constitutes a central concept in comparative public policy, it is not always consistently used and mixed up with related but not equivalent concepts. It is thus a basic objective of this paper to clarify the analytical relationship between policy convergence and related concepts used in the literature. Moreover, different approaches for the assessment and measurement of policy convergence will be presented.

In this paper, I develop a spectrum of response to these prescriptions that applies to key actors at the country level-national leaders, technocratic elites, and social groups-and ranges from acceptance to negotiation to rejection. The interplay of these responses in conjunction with the social, economic, and political context drives the overall response to, and impact of, development prescriptions. To illustrate this process I use the case of population policy in Nigeria, where a technocratic elite led by a charismatic minister of health accepted the policy largely on its own merits; national leaders negotiated the policy so it facilitated state-society relations, promoted nationalism, deflected blame for economic woes, and represented commitment to political restructuring; and the representatives of social groups rejected the policy. Donor pressure served as a backdrop to the whole process. Parsing country responses to development prescriptions in this manner explains why Nigeria, a country with pronatalist citizens and in which population was highly politicized, adopted a policy aiming to limit fertility. It also demonstrates that different actors within countries of the global south use development prescriptions as opportunities to achieve locally important goals. To make these arguments, I draw on rich primary data from key informants and Nigerian government documents. Ultimately, the rejection of the policy by women's organizations and religious groups, combined with financial duress, political chaos, and continued high desired fertility, prevented the policy from strongly influencing contraceptive provision or fertility. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

It is argued in this article that, once the first few successes were underway, governments with liberal outlooks toward taxation adopted the reform through a process of rational learning: an often radically new government will tend to adopt the policy based on successful implementation of its neighbours. The issue of policy diffusion is approached by explicitly modeling the different mechanisms that might underlie the process. Little evidence is found for pure 'bandwagoning' in the adoption of the flat tax - the presence of other market-minded reforms do not predict adoption of the flat tax, and contagion measures do not capture the dynamics of the adoption of the reform. Instead, rational learning, where economically right-wing governments evaluated the success of the reform (as measured by their ability to attract foreign investment) in the medium term, plays the largest role. Rational emulation in a shorter time period contributes to the probability of adoption as well, as does a change to an economically liberal ideology. © 2008 (European Consortium for Political Research).},

This article explores to what extent such paradigm has been emulated within the Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish health care systems. Reform in the direction of managed competition may be ascertained in all four countries. However, each country has emphasized different aspects of the paradigm, and the degree and rhythm of implementation of reform has varied. The article considers the circumstances under which the new paradigm was born, and its main characteristics; analyzes actual reforms in Southern European countries; and provides a tentative explanation of the diffusion mechanisms. It concludes that the crucial factor explaining the different paths of policy adoption and adaptation is the character of the initial health care system. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

To counter this trend, since the early 1980s, most OECD countries have changed the way hospitals are financed. Although these reforms are certainly linked to country-specific factors, the authors' main argument is that they are in part due to a diffusion process: Policy change in one country is influenced by previous changes in other countries. More specifically, the authors argue that policy makers learn from the experience of others. Using an original data set and event-history methods to test arguments, their results show that policy change is more likely when the existing policy is ineffective and when the experience of other countries suggests that the reform leads to the desired results. In addition, the authors find that the effects of learning grow over time and that early adopters tend to be countries with few veto players. © 2009 SAGE Publications.},

I argue that the diffusion of same-sex marriage bans was determined by the organized efforts of advocacy coalitions and internal state characteristics rather than by regional diffusion or communication among policy experts. I use state-level data collected from activists, media accounts, and official sources to establish the organized efforts to ban same-sex marriage. I then develop and empirically test a model of policy diffusion to predict both state consideration and adoption of policies banning same-sex marriage. The findings suggest that the diffusion of these policies is best explained by the presence of an organized national campaign by conservative religious groups, the local resources of interest groups, and other internal state characteristics rather than by regional diffusion patterns. I also find that the influence of state characteristics may vary during the policymaking process. © 2001 State Politics and Policy Organized Section of the American Political Science Association},

I explain this success based on a sociological institutionalist framework, arguing that lifelong learning has become a global norm in education policy. For this purpose, I conduct a quantitative study of 99 countries from 1996 to 2004, showing how the idea of lifelong learning has been disseminated by international organisations and how states have reacted to this development. I first outline the theoretical framework, highlighting in particular the crucial role of international organisations. In a further step, I present the data and methods. In the third part, I analyse the activities of several international organisations on lifelong learning. In the fourth step, I show how lifelong learning has spread, distinguishing the idea of lifelong learning and reforms linked to it. Fifth, as the quantitative analysis shows, international organisations like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union can explain a large part of dissemination when it comes to the idea of lifelong learning, but reforms are more dependent on national preconditions like the wealth of a country. In the conclusions, I sum up the article's main findings and outline further research areas linked to global diffusion processes. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

Exploring the selection of performance indicators in six countries (Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and the US), the article analyses the driving forces for the choice of particular indicators in the context of national administrative traditions and more recent reform agendas on the one hand and the trend towards international exchange and 'benchmarking' on the other hand. The article explores the relative significance and interaction of different driving forces of choice and how this shapes the development and application of performance indicators. To that end, it combines instutionalist approaches with the literature on the mechanisms and effects of international exchange and policy diffusion. Our analysis suggests that existing broad similarities are linked to similarities in core activities and values underlying contemporary public service reforms. Variation in the choice of performance indicators (PIs) reflects domestic factors such as governance arrangements through which broad reform trends are filtered. These arrangements also mediate any direct international learning. Points for practitioners: This article aims to contribute to the debate around how organizations could learn from the experience of others in designing performance indicators and management systems. Potential for cross-national and cross-sectional learning is particularly high in categories where a particular organization has not yet developed performance indicators but others have done so already. But any cross-reading from other countries' choices should take into account that the definition and use of performance indicators is to a substantial extent driven by domestic institutional traditions, governance arrangements and wider national approaches to performance management. The design of performance indicators should in particular take into account the accountability relations in which agencies are embedded. © 2008 IIAS, SAGE Publications.},

We test a comprehensive model of diffusion of international environmental management standards within the chemical industry using a panel of 113 different countries during the period 2000 to 2003. Our results show that the previous experience of businesses in voluntary standards such as the Chemical Industry's Responsible Care Program or ISO 9000, government commitment toward Environmental Management Systems Standards, and the level of activity of international nongovernmental organizations in the country of adoption, impact positively on the adoption of ISO 14001 by chemical firms. Unlike previous studies that focused mostly on cross industry analyses, we do not find trade-related factors significant while explaining adoption in the chemical industry. Our results differ, therefore, from previous research and highlight the need to isolate industry effects to understand the diffusion of international standards. © 2008 The Policy Studies Journal.},

	abstract = {One can be forgiven for wondering if the debate about references to foreign law in U.S. court opinions is much ado about nothing.1 In none of the cases that sparked the debate - Atkins v. Virginia,2 Lawrence v. Texas,3 and Roper v. Simmons4 - did the U.S. Supreme Court treat foreign law as binding law that could override U.S. law. Nor, as two recent articles empirically demonstrate, is the use of foreign law by U.S. courts anything new.5 For courts in other countries, the use of foreign law is "decidedly commonplace."6 Ye t "[t]here is little evidence to suggest parallel mobilization in opposition to foreign citations by courts abroad"7 - which suggests that the controversy in the United States indeed might be disproportionate to the problems posed by comparativism in judicial decision making. As Noga Morag-Levine states, "Supreme Court opinions are replete with references to extra-legal sources such as philosophical treatises and social science research. Why single out foreign case law as deserving of special condemnation?"8 After a careful analysis of the debate, Mark Tushnet concludes that what really is motivating critics of foreign law in U.S. courts is concern about the appropriate scope of judicial power, not foreign law per se.9 Nevertheless, the question of foreign law in domestic courts is an important one. Skeptics correctly warn that the use of foreign law - at least in the context of constitutional interpretation - raises serious issues of constitutional theory10 and comparative methodology. 11 Those more sympathetic to the use of foreign law not only disagree with skeptics' arguments that there is no "constitutional license" to use foreign law,12 but also claim that a greater willingness of domestic courts to use foreign law can improve the quality of constitutional decision making. The focus of existing research and commentary on both sides of this debate is on the constitutional issues associated with references to foreign law in U.S. court opinions and, more generally, on the important normative concerns about whether and how domestic courts should use foreign law. This work, however, focuses little attention on the actual consequences of domestic court references to foreign law and therefore eventually relies on untested empirical assumptions about what those consequences might be. 13 Nonconsequentialist reasons to favor or disfavor foreign law in domestic courts exist, of course. Ye t a well-informed, normative dialogue must be attentive to consequences, at least if it is to extend beyond the narrow confines of more formal variants of constitutional theory. The use of foreign law in domestic courts also raises interesting questions of positive theory - particularly about the relationship between different uses of foreign law and the cross-border migration of legal norms that so far are unexplored. For these reasons, this chapter proposes a social science approach that focuses on the empirical implications of foreign law in domestic courts. Unfortunately, the existing literature does not provide the conceptual foundations for exploring these implications. Scholars generally appreciate that domestic courts can use foreign law in different ways and that these differences are analytically significant, but the result has been an overabundance of typologies of different uses and a lack of conceptual clarity. Therefore, in the main part of this chapter, I will attempt to take a small conceptual step forward by consolidating into a single, manageable typology the many different uses of foreign law in domestic courts that already have been identified by scholars. No single typology can be useful for all purposes, and ultimately an empirical project motivated by a particular theory calls for concepts that are motivated by the same theory. Thus the goal is modest: to provide a language for a preliminary exploration of the empirical implications of different uses of foreign law that may be useful to a wide range of scholars. Next, I will build on the typology by considering the consequences of different uses of foreign law in domestic courts and the role of domestic courts as agents in processes of norm internalization and transnational policy diffusion. In particular, I will use the typology to examine the claim made by some critics that foreign law references in U.S. court opinions lead to the internalization of non-U.S. norms into U.S. society by changing domestic law or policy. Finally, I will suggest several avenues for future research on foreign law in domestic courts and domestic courts as institutional pathways for norm internalization. The central message is simple: Different uses of foreign law have different implications for the cross-border migration of legal norms, and both normative theory and positive theory should take these differences into account14. © 2010 State University of New York.

Much recent political analysis of public regulation tends to regard this worldwide spread of the American model, or "regulatory state," as a typical example of a policy diffusion mechanism, such as emulation or regulatory competition. After critically examining that view, this article develops an alternative framework that combines international structural forces, such as techno-economic changes and ideational factors, and domestic institutional factors, in particular, path dependence of historical institutions. The cross-national and cross-sectoral case analysis (the financial services and communications sector in Britain and Japan) demonstrates that while apparent convergence on the American model is due to international structural forces, national and sectoral differences with respect to the extent of organizational changes depend largely on domestic institutions. This finding suggests that, facing complex dynamism between international structural forces and domestic institutions, each national government chooses the feature of regulatory organization independently from other nation's decisions, rather than interdependently as assumed in the policy diffusion approach.},

This bias tends to severely overstate the extent to which policy changes depend on explicit emulation of other states rather than on a state's internal characteristics. This happens because the standard implementation conflates policy emulation and policy adoption: since early adopters are policy leaders, later adopters will appear to emulate them, even if they are acting independently. I demonstrate this ambiguity analytically and through Monte Carlo simulation. I then propose a simple modification of the dyadic emulation model that conditions on the opportunity to emulate and show that it produces much more accurate findings.

Scholars in the fields of international relations and comparative politics have identified a wide array of convergence mechanisms operating at the international or transnational level. In order to categorize this wide array of possible causes of policy convergence, we propose a typology of three broad classes of mechanisms: (1) the co-operative harmonization of domestic practices by means of international legal agreements or supranational law; (2) the coercive imposition of political practices by means of economic, political or even military threat, intervention or conditionality; and (3) the interdependent but uncoordinated diffusion of practices by means of cross-national imitation, emulation or learning. We illustrate and substantiate this claim through the empirical analysis of the international spread of three different kinds of policy innovation: national environmental policy plans and sustainable development strategies, environmental ministries and agencies, and feed-in tariffs and quotas for the promotion of renewable electricity. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

The theory assumes that governments' decisions constitute a strategic game in which governments are influenced by their neighbors. We suggest a variety of policy contexts in which the theory is applicable. For one such context'the adoption of lotteries by American states'we use the theory to generate several hypotheses and then test them using event history analysis.

Although diffusion processes are empirically proven, we witness two shortcomings in the discussion: First, there is a lack of comparative research across policy areas. Second, the question of why diffusion might not occur in a certain domain is under-theorized and lacks an empirical test. By comparing the rationale behind diffusion processes in two policy domains-energy policy and locational policy-this paper shows that two aspects matter for diffusion processes: First is the observability of policy measures, that is, how easily things can be observed by others; second is the competitiveness of the policy domain. If policy measures can be hidden easily and the policy domain is highly competitive, policy diffusion is very unlikely to happen. Therefore, we seek the integration of these two aspects in prospective diffusion research. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Neoliberal reforms in public policies and economic institutions proliferated across the developed democracies and the globe in the latter decades of the twentieth century. National structures of taxation have not been immune to neoliberalism. Beginning in the early 1980s, policymakers throughout the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) significantly altered the content of tax policies. The relative priority accorded equity and growth goals, the use of investment and behavioral incentives, and the level of tax rates were all notably changed: marginal income and corporate profits tax rates were scaled back, the number of brackets were cut and inflation-indexed, and tax-based investment incentives were eliminated or reduced to broaden the tax base. Why have nearly all developed nations enacted this set of market-conforming tax policies? To answer this question, I build on my recent work on the determinants of change in tax policy in the developed democracies and explore the dynamics of diffusion of the neoliberal tax policy paradigm in the area of capital taxation. While I assess general competition, policy learning, and social emulation models of tax policy diffusion, I argue that the highly visible 1986 market-conforming tax reform in the United States should be especially important in promoting diffusion. Specifically, I argue that (asymmetric) competition for mobile assets associated with US reforms significantly influences national policy choices in other polities. © 2007, Cambridge University Press.},

Using process tracing, I argue that bottom-up pressures, including professional norms and intergovernmental competition, were key for policy emulation. Cross-national competition had little effect on decision-making. Finally, top-down processes, including norms and financing, reinforced adoption decisions and ensured these programs would endure. © The Author 2011.

Drawing on extensive interviews, participant observation and an analysis of documentary sources, it concludes that there is little evidence to suggest these networks have affected the sig-nificant institutional change described in much of the literature. Rather, there is persuasive evidence that their influence on track one has waned in recent years. After canvassing a range of alternative explanations for this state of affairs, it argues that recent scholarship on track two has paid insufficient at-tention to the scope conditions that are a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for unofficial networks to successfully achieve policy diffusion.

	abstract = {New environmental policy instruments (NEPIs) (market-based instruments and environmental agreements) have moved to the forefront of environmental policy in recent years. From an economic theory perspective, NEPIs offer substantial benefits over 'command-and-control' regulation, yet empirical evaluations of their deployment and performance remain rare. This paper argues for a strong geographical contribution to this research agenda, utilising cross-national comparisons and actor-oriented perspectives to provide critical assessment and refinement of established NEPI theory. To illustrate this potential, this paper examines United Kingdom and German climate policy, using postal surveys and semi-structured interviews to assess corporate, industry association and policy-maker views on the effectiveness of eco-taxes, tradable permits and agreements in curbing greenhouse-gas emissions. Divergences between theoretical and practitioner perspectives on NEPIs are discussed, leading to suggested strategies for enhancing the environmental effectiveness of market-based instruments. The influence of national policy styles on NEPI design and industry reactions to these instruments was also identified as severely under-represented within economic theories of environmental regulation. Whilst industry assessments of environmental policy are unavoidably coloured by vested interests, cross-national and actor-oriented analyses nevertheless provide important insights into processes of policy diffusion and the strengths and weaknesses of different NEPIs. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this analysis, I consider how local economic and political conditions, as well as the rail promotion activities of a state's contiguous neighbors, impacted a legislature's rail promotion decisions. The findings suggest that states only engaged in rail promotion when local infrastructure was of poor quality and a state's tax revenues were sufficient to support rail expenditures. These findings reveal that diffusion, powered by social learning, does not drive all state policy innovations. Instead, local conditions and parallel thinking are important factors in state policy development. Furthermore, the analysis underscores the power of local governments in the antebellum period, while also raising the question of whether such diffuse state building was effective. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.},

Panel data drawn from 1994, 1999, and 2004 USA International City/County Management Association (ICMA) surveys on economic developments of municipal and county governments were used. Using a multilevel growth curve model, the findings indicated that the diffusion of management innovation (e.g., adoption of economic development plans and performance measures) did not spread as expected between and within the localities sampled, even if management innovation has become a widespread practice in federal and state governments. However, our estimates found that the diffusion factors (e.g., internal determinants, learning, and competitiveness) contributed to the adoption of a performance measure and to an economic development plan to retain and attract local businesses and to drive economic growth. Using a panel design (rather than a cross-sectional study) to look at the changes of adoption of management innovation, this research examined the diffusion of policy innovations in local management. State factors are found to have an impact on local practices in the USA. © 2011 eContent Management.},

In a highly variable and flexible in-stitutional geometry, the OECD is the site for a range of governance activities pertaining to agenda setting, soft harmonization of national policies across multiple policy areas, and hard regulation in the form of conventions and other instruments where the OECD represents a forum for inter-state decision making as well as policy implementation.

	abstract = {In this chapter we seek to address what the current trends in primary curriculum seem to indicate about the future, as well as exploring some of the possible curriculum developments that may be needed to enable primary schools to make an appropriate response to the shape of the future world. There is little argument that developments since the time of the Plowden Report (CACE 1967) have been influenced as much by ideology and politics as by research evidence or a considered response to social and technological change. While there has never been a time when literacy and numeracy were not seen as key elements in the primary school curriculum, nevertheless the wider setting in which these were located has varied markedly. In the post-Plowden era there was a strong commitment, amongst educationalists at least, to a child-centred curriculum based on children’s interests playing down the significance of subjects (especially when contrasted with the secondary school curriculum). The major ‘turn’ came as part of the 1988 Education Reform Act, when ‘English’ and ‘mathematics’ became the home of literacy and numeracy, respectively. These two subjects were joined by science to become the core subjects within the school curriculum from 5-16 and were to have priority treatment alongside the range of ‘foundation subjects’. Since that time literacy and numeracy have re-emerged as skill-oriented curriculum components, with their prescribed pedagogies in the primary school, through the development of the literacy and numeracy strategies that emerged during the period of transition from Conservative to New Labour government in 1997. However, the purpose of this chapter is not to engage with that interesting history but rather to assess current developments and what they may tell us about what is likely to emerge in the future. In so doing we will also comment on the wider policy context from which it is unwise to separate the primary school curriculum. We will also indicate some aspects of future scenarios that are worthy of attention. In setting about these tasks we offer a review of some of the recent alternatives that have been offered in part as a critique of dominant curricular approaches. These include schools that have established alternative curricula, new approaches that are being promoted within maintained (and other) schools, as well as reviewing recent developments in home schooling. There are two trajectories evident within recent curriculum reform: (1) a stronger focus on individual ‘capacities’ and the development of core transferable skills (rather than subject content); and (2) a discernible ‘affective turn’ evidenced in renewed interest in the management of emotions. These developments do not take place in a vacuum but are shaped by broader political, cultural and economic influences and by the shifting relative influence of social and ‘psy’ disciplines in education. The changes described above intersect with two broader influences on teachers’ work: the re-configuration or ‘re-professionalising’ of teachers’ work in the last two decades, and the challenges presented by the perceived needs of an emergent ‘knowledge society’. The potential for reform of the primary curriculum cannot be dislocated from these complex contextual factors. In the following section, we consider the implications of the ‘learning society’ for the formal school curriculum and suggest that the erosion of the transmission model has opened spaces for deliberation over the curriculum. We chart renewed interest in alternative approaches through a variety of forms - commissioned research reviews and targeted funding of a variety of local and national initiatives. We consider how alternative (‘progressive’) approaches with a long lineage are ‘mediated’ or ‘refracted’ in the contemporary policy field. In particular we identify elements of ‘travelling’ curriculum policy and suggest ways in which some of the enduring themes of primary education are blended with new approaches to serve the specific needs of the contemporary context. We conclude by suggesting that the curriculum of the future is likely to be constrained by a concern with responding to the political imperatives of the present, not least an enduring emphasis on performance. Whilst we note that the resurgence of interest in aspects of alternative approaches is in part a growing acknowledgement of the limitations of curricular prescription - for either the professional development of teachers or the advancement of children’s learning - we suggest that transferring ideas from one context of practice to another is not straightforward. In the process of policy diffusion a re-ordering takes place in which the demonstration of individual competence is valued more highly than the processes of dialogue and collaboration involved in the social construction of understanding - core concerns of alternative approaches. From the late 1990s teaching has been subject to successive waves of reform, with an explicit focus on classroom practice. The re-positioning of the teacher as ‘pedagogical technician’ has resulted in an emphasis on the acquisition of technical competence measured by compliance with performance criteria in professional standards. This reduction of the teacher’s role and erosion of the professional knowledge base of teaching leaves the profession vulnerable to external intervention. In the drive to raise standards through the identification of ‘what works’, central government has strengthened its influence and drawn on the ‘expert’ knowledge of a ready pool of ‘policy entrepreneurs’ (Ball 1994). The ‘what works’ agenda has increased teachers’ and Local Authorities’ attraction to the problem solving skills traded by educational consultants and trainers. One consequence of this commodification of professional knowledge is the conflation of the affective and the performative; a process that has been referred to elsewhere as the ‘instrumentalisation of the expressive’ (Hartley 2003; Zembylas 2006). A loose coupling between emotion management and performance improvement has emerged from the intersection of child-centered education in the primary sector and outcomes driven assessment in the post-primary phase. We argue here that the contemporary ‘affective turn’ creates a backwards glance to child-centered pedagogies and alternative education, but it does so in a field where the management of the expressive is harnessed to equip individuals with the emotional resilience to cope in a system driven by the imperative of the ‘examination’. From this perspective the primary curriculum of the future remains inextricably influenced by the performative culture prevalent in secondary schooling. © 2010 The University of Cambridge.},

First, existing empirical evidence relating to state climate change policy adoption is reviewed. Following this brief discussion, several analytic approaches are presented that test specific hypotheses derived from the internal determinants and regional diffusion models of policy adoption. Policy diffusion is tested as a function of the motivations, resources, and obstacles of policy change. Motivations for policy innovation include environmental conditions and demands of citizens. Resources include state financial and geographic resources, such as wind and solar potential. Obstacles include a state's reliance on carbon-intensive industries such as coal and natural gas. The results show that internal factors, particularly citizens' demands, are stronger predictors of states' policies than are diffusion effects from neighboring states. © 2008 Policy Studies Organization.},

The use of such liens by right-wing Patriot groups grew in the 1990s, leading us to focus on key issues related to policy diffusion - the extent of the problem or threat, and the characteristics of regional response. To test specific hypotheses we use Event History Analysis on a state-level dataset from 1995 to 1999. Our results suggest that state adoption of lien laws is mostly driven by regional forces, including the regional threat posed by Patriot groups and the adoption of lien laws by other states in the region, rather than national forces or factors internal to a state. We conclude that previous research has been too limited in its conceptualization of regional influences and that these same forces will likely drive future state-level response to the threat of terrorism.},

The authors' data capture both the national and the sectoral patterns of the rise of the new order, and the authors distinguish between (1) national patterns of diffusion, whereby the number of prior regulatory authorities within a country determines the probability of the establishment of new authorities in that country; and (2) sectoral patterns of diffusion, whereby the number of prior regulatory authority in the same sector in other countries determines the probability of the establishment of new regulatory authority in that sector. The results coincide with a growing body of literature that emphasizes the role of contagious diffusion and shed some new light on sectoral and national channels of diffusion.},

While both international intergovernmental organization (IGO) and international non-governmental organization (INGO) networks support this norm, they differ on the adequacy of the Compact's program design. We explore how this tension affects the diffusion of the Compact across countries, which vary in their levels of embeddedness in IGO and INGO networks. Our findings suggest that embeddedness in IGO networks encourages adoption, while embeddedness in INGO networks discourages it. Our analysis provides important lessons for sponsors of voluntary governance mechanisms.

I discuss the conventional explanations from the literature on policy diffusion and the politics of taxation and tax policy reform. These include domestic and external factors, such as external influence through conditionality, party ideology, veto players and trade unionism. I apply a process-tracing method to explore how Georgian tax policy was (re)made over a period of 15 years. Two arguments are developed: one that the making of the new Georgian state and tax policy formation are interlinked processes; second, the transnationalization of a policy arena, that is infiltration by nonstate actors who internalize external policy norms and preferences, can lead to a tax policy shift towards neoliberalism. However, the creation of a capable Georgian state was a by-product of changes in tax policy and administration after the political changes of 2003. I conclude that transnationalization can explain the process of policy reforms in reducing marginal tax rates, adopting a flat tax rate and simplifying tax policy to attract capital and promote economic growth. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

In this article, we argue that these two types of diffusion may have different implications for when a state first adopts a policy and subsequent changes in the extent of that policy and that these effects vary by policy area. In the specific policy area that we study, Indian gaming, we expect social learning diffusion to influence adoption but not expansion; economic competition should influence both policy adoption and policy expansion. Our empirical results confirm these predictions. To study both policy adoption and innovation, we apply models for event counts to state policy data, which allows us to model the extent of policy adoption over time, rather than just the timing of first adoption as is common with event history models.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for analysing domestic factors behind policy diffusion and convergence. Three basic factors are distinguished, determining the extent to which countries are likely to take up different types of new policies. These factors are: culture, institutions and economy. They are operationalized with the help of three indicators: dominant religious tradition (culture), the prevailing orientation towards public/private relations (institutions), and the level of economic development (economy). It is argued that these factors may be important to different degrees, dependent on whether policy change involves the basic goals and ideas of a policy, the instruments applied, or the setting or calibration of these instruments. This leads to the hypothesis that countries that are culturally, institutionally or economically close may be expected to adopt similar ideas, instruments or settings in public policy, respectively, and thus are likely to converge on these points. While the argument proposed in this paper applies to policy change generally, we focus on environmental policy for illustration. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

In this article, we assess the role that religious organizations play in American federal democracy, promoting diffusion or the status quo, with respect to one crucial issue on which religious groups have been particularly vocal: the environment and global warming. We employ two datasets (a large-N national survey and two in-depth survey case studies of clergy in Ohio and South Carolina) and find evidence that religious organizations are vast communication networks that can promote policy diffusion, but typically do not. © 2010 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.},

The underlying argument is that the ratification behaviour of (specific) other countries sends particular signals - for instance signals about implementation costs, competitiveness effects or reputation costs - to the country in question. The empirical testing is done on data for ratification of the UN Economic Commission for Europe's agreements on long-range transboundary air pollution. The results show that international factors are as important in influencing ratification choices as domestic factors.

Many of those policies are inspired by EU climate strategies. The EU actively promotes these policies in its external relations, such as in its partnership on climate change with China. This leads us to three sets of questions. Does the EU act as a transformative power in interregional cooperation on climate change? Can we identify a climate change policy diffusion process in EU-Chinese relations, and, if so, which communication channels as well as diffusion mechanisms can be identified? And, finally, is interregional cooperation on climate change a building block or a stumbling block in the global climate change regime? This article argues that the policy diffusion process depends on the scope of the interregional communication process between the EU and China, and the willingness and national responsiveness of China to adopt policy innovations. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

Motivated by the relative dearth of empirical work on minimum wages in the American states, this article considered various explanations to determine which factors are associated with legislative efforts to pass wage increases. Taking seriously the view that disagreements over the effects of minimum wage increases enhances the influence of political factors, we drew on the policy adoption and diffusion literature to examine how internal determinants (political and economic variables) and regional diffusion pressures relate to both the introduction and adoption of minimum wage legislation in the American states in the years between the last two federal minimum wage increases (1997-2006). Employing negative binomial regression to analyze annual bill introductions, we found that a number of political variables are related to the consideration of minimum wage increases. However, using event history analysis to examine annual adoptions of minimum wage increases, we found few of the same variables matter. We concluded with a discussion of the empirical results within the context of the broader policy literature and cautioned future scholars to consider seriously whether political factors exert distinct influences at different stages of the policy process. © 2012 Policy Studies Organization.},

By examining a rational learning model and the decisions of a set of developing countries to open up their trade regimes, I show that countries are particularly influenced by the choices of neighbouring countries and by particularly successful policy experiences. These are two typical contentions of the bounded learning literature. I argue that bounded learning and rational learning yield the same results as soon as one drops the rational learning assumption that there are zero costs to gathering new information.

While the terminology and focus often vary, all of these studies are concerned with a similar process in which knowledge about policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in one political setting (past or present) is used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in another political setting. Given that this is a growing phenomenon, it is something that anyone studying public policy needs to consider. As such, this article is divided into four major sections. The first section briefly considers the extent of, and reasons for, the growth of policy transfer. The second section then outlines a framework for the analysis of transfer. From here a third section presents a continuum for distinguishing between different types of policy transfer. Finally, the last section addresses the relationship between policy transfer and policy "failure.".},

	abstract = {A major omission in diffusion research is the scope of change in program adoptions. Diffusion studies focus almost exclusively on the rate of change, thus ignoring possible variance in the content of programs selected by leaders, followers, and laggards. States may adopt new programs in one area, such as state-mandated student testing. While most states now have a testing policy, these policies vary in terms of the number of students subject to examinations. Thus, the amount of program change depends on the content of each state's policy. An interstate diffusion study of the pattern of program adoptions ignores this variance. It is also possible that policy scope is influenced by certain aspects of the diffusion process. One possibility is that program innovators generally select more extensive programs than followers. Similarities or differences in policy scope among adopters may also be related to innovation attributes (e.g., whether a new program is symbolic, redistributive, or administratively complex). Finally, the number of years required for interstate diffusion may result in similarities or differences in policy content. © 1985, CSF Associates.},

Half of these cases of ‘probable diffusion’ are then subjected to detailed case study analysis. It turns out that the similarities are indeed results of diffusion from Sweden to Finland, i.e. involve a conscious introduction of Swedish modeis into Finnish politics. No one pattern of diffusion can be observed, but the author suggests that there are four typical kinds of diffusion: political, bureaucratic, corporative and cumulative. In a discussion of implications for further research the author stresses that more attention should be paid to purely domestic factors in the study of Nordic relations.

This manuscript focuses on differences in the patterns of reinvention for three different policy innovations with different rates of diffusion: child abuse reporting laws, crime victim compensation laws, and public campaign funding laws. Moreover, how the pattern changes after states amend their initial laws is examined. The data show evidence of reinvention during diffusion but provide only limited support for the first hypothesis that the pattern of reinvention is one of increasing comprehensiveness over time. Consistent with expectations, the data reveal little relationship between the date of adoption and the current law's comprehensiveness, including amendment.},

Given the well-documented difficulties with pay for performance in the federal government and, increasingly, in the private sector, the research asks, Why do state governments continue to adopt the programs? The author's survey of those states with current pay for performance legislation or provisions finds that not all states with programs on the books have operational systems, nor do those with operational programs fund them consistently. A majority of personnel directors finds the systems to be somewhat effective, or as in improving manager-employee communication and overall direction of employees, but implementation problems occurred in nearly every state in the survey. Further, there was a significant gap between initial expectations for pay for performance and the reality of the programs. The author suggests that for future policy expansion and diffusion a set of decision criteria more closely linking policy expectations with personnel system's capability and support is necessary. © 1993, Sage Publications.

Three case studies - namely, the single currency, tax policy and media ownership policy - are discussed and compared with the aim of assessing the potential of isomorphism for the analysis of policy diffusion. The author argues that European institutions, which have a serious limitation in terms of legitimacy, stimulate policy transfer by catalyzing isomorphic processes. Policy transfer, however, is constrained when there are no national cases to be imitated. Yet European institutions, most notably the European Commission, can overcome the problem by "inseminating" solutions into national political systems.},

	abstract = {Most students of policy diffusion have noted that new policies have tended to be adopted by most American states in ever shorter time spans in the twentieth century. Historically, rapid policy diffusion has usually occurred only when the federal government has served as a central propagating agency, especially when it has used the incentive of grant funds. In the past decade, however, a number of policies have diffused rapidly (i.e., thirty or more states adopting in one to five years, with little or no central propagation). During 1983-1984, two such policies were laws mandating child passenger restraints and lemon-aid laws. Two broad agenda items, education reform and driving while intoxicated, also received much attention in 1984. A variety of specific policies were enacted in a majority of the states. It would appear that some problems become so widespread today that proffered solutions are readily snapped up by state governments as though the policies were ones whose "time has come." The rapidity of their diffusion seems limited primarily by their "fragility," that is, the degree of perceived organized resistance to their adoption. © 1985, CSF Associates.},

I emphasize the pivotal role of the policy networks of international organizations (IOs) as partly autonomous actors in regime formation and change. Policy networks are conceptualized as dependent as well as independent variables of global forestry management. This is perceived as an exciting duality of contending positions in both international relations and international organization theories. I identify functional as well as dysfunctional processes of interorganizational coordination, and propose new forms of a consensual, multi-stakeholder approach to decision-making in global forestry management. I consider the ideational model of global forestry learning and policy diffusion through the IPF Secretariat not as a comprehensive alternative to a forestry convention, but rather as an important amendment to effective regime formation and change in the absence of a formal, legally binding international accord.},

This analysis examines the innovativeness of state judicial systems, the correlates of innovativeness, and the pattern of diffusion. The findings suggest that the diffusion of judicial doctrines is a very different process from the diffusion of legislation. A major reason for the difference appears to be the courts' dependence on litigants to provide opportunities for innovation. © 1981, American Political Science Association. All rights reserved.},

Policy diffusion research provides some guidelines for the study of correctional policy adoption, although there are competing theories about the variation in policy adoption. This study explores the adoption of pre-release centers by the states in the 1970s, under a previous federal impetus to promote state policy change. The findings suggest greater support for institutional factors than for economic development factors in the implementation of pre-release centers, but they also suggest that caution is necessary in distinguishing symbolic from programmatic policy initiatives. © 1995, The College of Public and Urban Affairs, Georgia State University.

In turn, we also critique the logical derivative, namely, the notion that housing policies which have been 'successful' in their country of origin can be transferred to (that is, exported to or imported by) other societies. To do this, we commence by developing a conceptual framework that is based on the idea of societal 'divergence' rather than universalism. This provides a comparative method which we then apply in order to examine the second-home ownership problematic in Britain and Sweden. In doing so, they demonstrate that the problems caused by postwar growth in second-home ownership (and the associated housing policy responses that have been formulated) are particular to each country. To conclude, we make some general observations about the limits of policy diffusion by highlighting the conditions in which imported or exported housing policies are likely to succeed or fail.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  The introduction of information technology to governmental agencies has raised considerable concern for the erosion of personal privacy in most advanced democratic states. This article compares and tries to explain the choice of policy instrument in four key countries (Sweden, the United States, West Germany and the United Kingdom) to enforce the protection of personal data. Five options were available from the ‘international repertoire’ of solutions: voluntary control, subject control, licensing, a data commissioner and registration. The Swedes opted for licensing, the Americans rely on subject control, the Germans established a data commissioner and the British chose a registration scheme. In no state, however, were these decisions made from a synoptic analysis of all possible options. Nor did a process of policy diffusion occur. Rather, a combination of domestic constraints seemed to filter out unacceptable options and produce a bias in favour of the resulting policy instrument. In the United States and Sweden, this bias resulted from perceived constitutional imperatives; in West Germany and Britain, the position and power of the respective national bureaucracies produced stiff resistance, a conflictual policy process and resulting policy instruments with few, if any, precedents in their respective systems.

Recognizing that this policy diffusion literature largely exhibits a geographic focus rather than the client focus predominant in most other diffusion research, the argument is nevertheless made that this field of diffusion studies has not yet become welded into a distinctive college of mutually aware scholars. Still, following Everett Rogers' model of the diffusion process, American state policy diffusion studies are reviewed so as to present emerging generalizations, current blindspots suggested by Rogers' model, and departures from other diffusion research findings. Diffusion of judicial innovations is reviewed separately as a special subset of policy diffusion research.

However, among political scientists, an awkward separation has emerged between scholars investigating policy diffusion processes and those investigating policy networks and, more generally, the role of ideas in politics. In this article, we present a theoritical argument for integrating insights from policy networks studies into diffusion studies. Since they face clear incentives to tap the resources of policy networks, we give policy entrepreneurs a prominent place in this discussion. Using event history analysis models of the diffusion of school choice ideas across the United States, we test the empirical relevance of our discussion and find that greater involvement in policy networks significantly increases the likelihood of policy entrepreneurs achieving their legislative goals. Based on our theoretical discussion and these empirical results, we suggest that political scientists investigating the diffusion of policy innovations should pay careful attention to the role that policy networks play in this process.},

It is suggested that RTD policy processes within the EC and individual states were linked to each other in a European policy process, and that the convergence of such policies was a function of policy diffusion. An analytical approach of policy diffusion is outlined in order to study the linkages between national and EU policy processes. A policy diffusion perspective, which entails how policies are formed in a communication between various national political-administrative systems, can be seen as an important contribution to the study of the dynamics behind the European integration process. It is suggested that the OECD, with its informal and non-hierarchical cooperation structure, is an important condition for policy diffusion, and that this type of cooperation can also be found within the EU. The EU, which can be characterized as a type of multilevel governance, enhances communication between national political-administrative systems and thus the processes of policy diffusion. © Sage Publications.},
